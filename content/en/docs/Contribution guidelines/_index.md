  How to contribute to Docsy
---

Docsy is an open source project and we love getting patches and contributions to make Docsy and its docs even better.

## Contributing to Docsy

The Docsy theme itself lives in <https://github.com/google/docsy>.

### Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Community guidelines

This project follows
[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google.com/conduct/).

### Creating issues

Alternatively, if there's something you'd like to see in Docsy (or if you've found something that isn't working the way you'd expect), but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an [issue](https://github.com/google/docsy/issues).

## Contributing to these docs

This user guide is, like our example site, a Docsy site that uses the Hugo static site generator. 
We use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to manage the deployment of the site. This guide assumes you're familiar with basic GitHub workflows.

### Quick start with Netlify


### Previewing your changes locally

If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:

1. Follow the instructions in [Getting started](/docs/getting-started) to install Hugo and any other tools you need.
1. Fork the [wherever this goes] repo into your own project, then create a local copy using
1. Run `hugo server` in the site root directory
