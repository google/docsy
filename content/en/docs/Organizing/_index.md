  Optional guidance and recommendations on how to organize your documentation site.
---

If you have a look at our example site, you'll see that we've organized the Documentation section into a number of subsections, each with some recommendations about what you might put in that section.

## Do I need to use this structure?

Absolutely not! The site structure in the Example Site was created to meet the needs of large docsets for large products with lots of features, potential tasks, and reference elements. For a simpler docset (like this one!), it's fine to just structure your docs around specific features that your users need to know about.  Even for larger documentation sets, you may find that the structure isn't useful "as is", or that you don't need to use all the section types.

We do recommend that (as we've done here) you provide at least:

* An **Overview** of the product (either on the docs landing page or a separate Overview page) that tells the user why they should be interested in your project.
* A **Getting Started** page.
* Some **Examples**.

Feel free to copy the [Docsy user guide site](/link/to/eventual/repo) or docs section instead if you like this simpler structure better.

## Why this structure?

We based the Example Site structure on...

## What about writing style?

This guide and the example site just address how to organize your documentation content into pages and sections. For some guidance on how to organize and write the content in each page, we recommend the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/), particularly the [Style Guide Highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights).
