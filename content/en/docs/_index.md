Welcome to the Docsy theme user guide! This guide shows you how to get started creating technical documentation sites using Docsy, including site customization and how to use Docsy's blocks and templates.

## What is Docsy?

## Ready to get started?

Find out how to build and serve your first site in [Getting Started](getting-started/). We've also provided an [example site](https://github.com/google/docsy-example) that uses lots of Docsy features and has a useful skeleton site structure: you can copy the entire site for your own projects, or just explore the site and its source to see what Docsy can do.
