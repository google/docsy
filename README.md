# Docsy

Docsy is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme for technical documentation sets, providing simple navigation, site structure, and more.

This is not an officially supported Google product. This project is actively being maintained.

## Prerequisites

The following are basic prerequisites for using Docsy in your site:

- Install a recent release of the Hugo "extended" version (we recommend version 0.53 or later). If you install from the 
  [release page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases), make sure you download the `_extended` version 
  which supports SCSS.

- Install `PostCSS` so that the site build can create the final CSS assets. You can install it locally by running 
  the following commands from the root directory of your project:

  ```
  sudo npm install -D --save autoprefixer
  sudo npm install -D --save postcss-cli
  ```

## Example and usage

You can find an example project that uses Docsy in the [Docsy Example Project repo](https://github.com/google/docsy-example). The Docsy Example Project is hosted at [https://example.docsy.dev/](https://example.docsy.dev/).

To use the Docsy theme for your own site:

  - (Recommended) Copy the [example project](https://github.com/google/docsy-example),
ï¿¼	   which includes the Docsy theme as a submodule.
    You can customize this pre-configured basic site into your own Docsy themed site.

  - Add Docsy to your existing Hugo site repo's `themes` directory. You can either add Docsy as a Git submodule, or 
    clone the Docsy theme into your project.

See the [Docsy Getting Started Guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/) for 
details about the various usage options.

## Documentation

Docsy has its own user guide (using Docsy, of course!) with lots more information about using the theme, which you can find at [https://docsy.dev/](https://docsy.dev/). Alternatively you can use Hugo to generate and serve a local copy of the guide (also useful for testing local theme changes), making sure you have installed all the prerequisites listed above:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy.git
cd docsy/userguide/
hugo server --themesDir ../..
```

Note that you need the `themesDir` flag when running Hugo because the site files are inside the theme repo.
