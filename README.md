## ðŸš§ WARNING ðŸš§ : `main` is under development and potentially unstable! Use official Docsy [releases].

Docsy is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme for technical documentation sets,
providing simple navigation, site structure, and more.

This is not an officially supported Google product. This project is actively
being maintained.

## Prerequisites

The following are basic prerequisites for using Docsy in your site:

- Install a recent release of the Hugo "extended" version. If you install from
  the [Hugo release page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases), make sure
  you download the `extended` version, which supports SCSS.

- Install `PostCSS` so that the site build can create the final CSS assets. You
  can install it locally by running the following commands from the root
  directory of your project:

  ```sh
  npm install --save-dev autoprefixer
  npm install --save-dev postcss-cli
  ```

  Starting in
  [version 8 of `postcss-cli`](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md),
  you must also separately install `postcss`:

  ```sh
  npm install -D postcss
  ```

Any additional prerequisites depend on the
[installation option](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/#installation-options)
you choose. We recommend using Docsy as a Hugo module, which requires that you
have the Go language installed in addition to Hugo and PostCSS.

For complete prerequisites and instructions, see our
[Get started guides](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/).

## Example and usage

You can find an example project that uses Docsy in the
[Docsy Example Project repo](https://github.com/google/docsy-example).The Docsy
Example Project is hosted at [example.docsy.dev](https://example.docsy.dev). For
real-life examples of sites that use Docsy (and their source repos), see our
[Examples](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/examples/) page.

To use the Docsy theme for your own site:

- (Recommended) Use the
  [example project](https://github.com/google/docsy-example), which includes the
  Docsy theme as a Hugo module, as a template to create your project. You can
  customize this pre-configured basic site into your own Docsy themed site.

- Add Docsy to your existing Hugo site. You can add Docsy as a Hugo module, as a
  Git submodule, or clone the Docsy theme into your project.

See the [Get started guides](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/) for
details about the various usage options.

## Documentation

Docsy has its own user guide (using Docsy, of course!) with lots more
information about using the theme. It is hosted by [Netlify] at
[docsy.dev](https://docsy.dev). For deploy logs and more, see [Deploys] from the
site's Netlify dashboard.

Alternatively you can use Hugo to generate and serve a local copy of the guide
(also useful for testing local theme changes), making sure you have installed
all the prerequisites listed above:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy.git
cd docsy/userguide/
npm install
npm run serve
```
