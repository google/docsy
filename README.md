# Tech Doc Hugo

Hugo theme and skeleton project.

## Installation

You need a recent version of Hugo to run this project (preferably 0.45+). If you install from the [release page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases), make sure to get the `extended` Hugo version. Alternatively, on macOS you can install via Brew.

If you want to do stylesheet changes, you will also need `PostCSS` to create the final assets. You can also install it locally with:

```
npm install
````

Clone the repo using:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/bep/tech-doc-hugo.git
```

## Running the website locally

From the repo root folder, run:

```
hugo server
```
