**Client-side chrome restoration (CCR)** is the mechanism behind Docsy's
experimental `shared` chrome [build mode](/docs/deployment/chrome/): the build
drops the repeated navbar, footer, and left-nav from most pages and the browser
restores them from a donor. This is the **case registry**: every way a restored
page can differ from a full build — each a **case** with a stable `CCR-NN` ID —
and where a test covers it.

- **User docs:** [Chrome build modes](/docs/deployment/chrome/).
- **Tracking issue:** [#2659][].
- Tests cite their case ID in a header comment, so the ID ↔ test link is
  greppable both ways (`grep -rn CCR-13 tests/`).

IDs are stable and append-only — never reused or renumbered. **Status** is
_restored_ (matches a full build), _partial_ (common case matches; a documented
case diverges — see notes), or _deferred_ (known, not yet handled). The
**Tests** column names fixture-site tests (drop the `.test.mjs` suffix), under
`tests/fixture-site/`; `—` means no dedicated test yet.

## Open items

- **CCR-10** (language-link exactness) — _partial._ The prefix-swap is exact
  when translations share slugs and all exist (the common case). When the
  current page has **no translation** in a locale, a full build renders that
  item disabled while shared mode restores a live link to the non-existent page.
  The divergence is pinned by a known-limitation test in `chrome-selectors`.
  **Planned next:** bake each page's available locales into the navbar
  placeholder and emit a disabled item for the rest, matching a full build (a
  differing-slug variant would also need this per-page hint).
- **CCR-07** (non-foldable reveal) and **CCR-14** (scoped-root structural
  residual) lack dedicated unit coverage. CCR-14 is browser-invisible — it shows
  only in a serialized-HTML diff, not the rendered nav — and gates reinstating
  the docsy.dev `sidebar_root_for` example; a JSON doctree that re-renders the
  subtree would close it.
- **CCR-19** (sidebar placeholder whitespace trim) has no dedicated test but is
  exercised indirectly: every `chrome-equivalence` / `chrome-nav` assertion
  would fail on a stray placeholder seam.
- **CCR-15 / CCR-16** (print / paginated canonical URL) are validated through
  the shared canonical-path mechanism in `chrome-canonical`, simulated via a
  print-style request URL — no real `_print/*` or `/page/N/` output is built
  yet. A real print/paginator fixture is a follow-up.
- **Donor-fetch failures** in `chrome-nav.js` currently `console.warn` and leave
  the placeholder in place. A richer recovery (retry, visible fallback) is
  deferred while the mode stays experimental; revisit if it is promoted.
- **No end-to-end coverage** yet — a single real-browser smoke test (served
  shared-mode site, assert restored regions) would guard the jsdom-vs-browser
  gap.
