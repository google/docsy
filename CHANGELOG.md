## 0.9.0

> ### UNRELEASED: this planned version is still under development.

For the full list of changes, see the [0.9.0] release notes.

**Breaking changes**:

- [Repository Links] now work for [multi-language] sites ([#1744]).

  For any given page, repository links are now computed from a page's _resolved_
  `File` path &mdash; as resolved _through_ mount points, if any. That is, the
  path used is the one that refers to the file's actual location on disk, not
  it's logical path in Hugo's [union file system].

  This is a breaking change for pages of sites that use mounts and
  [path_base_for_github_subdir]. Projects will need to adjust the value of
  [path_base_for_github_subdir] to be relative to the file's physical location.

- Class names to disable [repository links] were misnamed with a suffix of the
  form `--KIND`. The new suffix is `__KIND`. For details, see [Disabling links].

- Docsy statically generates anchor-links after headings using Hugo's
  [render-heading.html](https://gohugo.io/templates/render-hooks/) hook. This is
  _potentially_ a breaking change for projects that override the hook.

- The footer layout has been factored into parts: left, right, and center, with
  copyright a subpart of center. Each part has its own style tag, for example:
  `td-footer__left`. Note that the style `td-footer__copyright-etc` has been
  renamed to `td-footer__center`. For details concerning all foot changes, see
  [#1818].

- **Footer, copyright notice**:
  - display of year can now be customized via .Site.Params.copyright.year
  - title displayed after year must now be given via
    .Site.Params.copyright.title

**Other changes**:

- The latest release of [Mermaid] resources are fetched at build time ([#1410]).
- Docsy follows recommended accessibility practice: page-body links are
  underlined. For details, see [#1814] and [#1815].

## 0.8.0

For the full list of changes, see the [0.8.0] release notes.

**Breaking changes**:

- Docsy is packaged as a **single Hugo module** ([#1120]).
  - For details, see [Use Docsy as a Hugo Module].
- **Important**: non-Hugo-module projects should read the [Docsy NPM install
  side-effect] note.
- **Page feedback**, or [User feedback]:
  - In support of projects configuring analytics outside of Docsy, feedback
    functionality is enabled regardless of whether
    `site.Config.Services.GoogleAnalytics.ID` is set ([#1727]).
  - Feedback-event attribute changes ([#1726]):
    - Event `name` is `page_helpful`rather than`click`
    - Event `value` for "yes" is 100 by default, rather than 1, allowing for
      more response options in the future. To override the default set
      `params.ui.feedback.max_value`.
- SCSS: `@function prepend()` and file `assets/scss/support/_functions.scss`
  have been dropped. Instead use the more general SASS/SCSS list `join()`
  function ([#1385]).

## 0.7.0

For the full list of changes, see the [0.7.0] release notes.

**New**:

- **Click to copy button for Chroma-highlighted code blocks**: If you already
  implemented this functionality on your website, you can disable it. For
  details see [Chroma highlighting docs][chroma-docsy].

**Breaking changes:**

- [**Hugo** release][hugo-releases] **0.110.0** or later is required.
- **Upgraded Bootstrap ([#470])** to v5.2. For a list of Bootstrap's breaking
  changes, see the [Bootstrap migration page][bsv5mig]. Docsy-specific changes:
  - Clean up of unused, or rarely used, variables, functions, and mixins:
    - Dropped `$primary-light`
    - Dropped `color-diff()`
    - Dropped `bg-gradient-variant()` mixin ([#1369])
  - Docsy's RTL support has been removed because it is incompatible with BSv5.
    For progress on the reintroduction of RTL support, see [#1442].
- **Shortcodes**:
  - Now using Hugo's native support for processing HTML & markdown, not file
    extension testing. ([#906])
  - Dropped support for pre-Hugo-0.54.x behavior of `{{% %}}`. ([#939])
  - `blocks/section`: **default** and accepted values of the `type` argument
    have changed! For details see [blocks/section] ([#1472]).
  - **Card shortcodes** ([#1376])]:
    - Renamed CSS class `td-card-deck` to `td-card-group`.
    - `card`, `card-code`: markup of inner content (HTML/markdown) now depends
      on the syntax of the calling shortcode, not on extension of page file any
      more [#906].
    - `card-code` is deprecated; use `card` with named parameter `code=true`
      instead.

[chroma-docsy]:
  https://www.docsy.dev/docs/adding-content/lookandfeel/#code-highlighting-with-chroma

- **Detection of draw.io diagrams** is now **disabled** by default [#1185]

**Other changes**:

- `$list-inline-padding` is increased in support of footer icons ([#1523]). If
  this global adjustment is a problem for your project, let us know and we can
  contextualize the adjustment to the footer.
- Non-breaking changes that result from the Bootstrap v5 upgrade:
  - Draw.io diagram edit button: replaced custom colors by BS's outline primary.

## 0.6.0

For the full list of changes, see the [0.6.0] release notes.

With this release we declare a feature freeze while we migrate to the newest
Bootstrap version. See [the announcement][bs-announcement] for more information.

**New**:

- **Simplified use of mermaid diagrams**: when using a `mermaid` code block on
  your page, mermaid is now automatically enabled (needs hugo version >=
  0.93.0). For existing sites build with hugo 0.93.0+, parameter
  `mermaid.enable` can be removed from site config.

- **Add render hook for chem code blocks**: add auto-activation of `math` and
  `chem` blocks via KateX and mhchem. Support for formula rendering activation
  on individual pages only. Hugo version >= 0.93.0 required.

## 0.5.1

For the full list of changes, see the [0.5.1] release notes. **BREAKING
CHANGES** are documented below.

**After you update** your project's Docsy:

- Update your project setup (see [0.4.0]) if you haven't already.
- Run `npm install`.

**New**:

- Projects can now install and use [Docsy as an NPM package].

**Breaking changes**:

- **Tabbed panes, text display**. By default, the content of a tab inside a
  tabbed pane is shown as code. As of version 0.4 of the shortcode, you can add
  the parameter `code=false` to your `tabpane` or `tab` shortcode in order to
  render tab content(s) as text (markdown or html). As of version 0.5 the name
  of this parameter was changed, we now use `text=true` in order to mark content
  as text.
- **Display logo by default**. Most projects show their logo in the navbar. In
  support of this majority, Docsy now displays a logo by default. For details on
  how to hide the logo (or your brand name), see [Styling your project logo and
  name].
- **Upgraded Bootstrap** to v4.6.2 from v4.6.1, resulting in some style changes
  (such as an adjustment in the size of `small`). For details, see [v4.6.2
  release notes].
- **[Upgraded FontAwesome]** to v6 from v5. While many icons were renamed, the
  v5 names still work. For details about icon renames and more, see [What's
  changed].
- **Search-box**: the HTML structure and class names have changed, due to the
  Font Awesome upgrade, for both online and offline search. This may affect your
  project if you have overridden search styling or scripts.

**Other changes**:

- By default, Docsy now uses the [gtag.js] analytics library for all site tags.
  For details, see [Adding Analytics > Setup].

## 0.5.0

Unpublished.

## 0.4.0

For the full list of changes, see the [0.4.0] release notes. Potential
**BREAKING CHANGES** are documented below.

**After you update** your project's Docsy, run `npm install`.

### Update your project setup

If your project uses Docsy as follows:

- [Hugo Module], then this change doesn't impact you.
- For [other Docsy setups], this is a **BREAKING CHANGE** -- read on.

Docsy now fetches Bootstrap and FontAwesome as NPM packages rather than git
submodules. This has an impact on your project-build setup. To migrate your
site, follow these steps (execute commands from your project's root directory):

1.  Delete obsolete Docsy Git submodules:
    ```sh
    git rm themes/docsy/assets/vendor/Font-Awesome
    git rm themes/docsy/assets/vendor/bootstrap
    ```
    These commands remove the submodules from Git's tracking, from the
    `.gitmodules` file, and deletes the submodule files under
    `themes/docsy/assets/vendor`.
2.  Get Docsy dependencies:
    ```sh
    (cd themes/docsy && npm install)
    ```
3.  Update your build scripts to fetch Docsy dependencies automatically. For
    example, if your site build uses NPM scripts, consider getting Docsy
    dependencies via a [prepare] script as follows:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-website",
      "scripts": {
        "prepare": "cd themes/docsy && npm install",
        "...": "..."
      },
      "...": "..."
    }
    ```
4.  (Optional) Build script cleanup. If your project uses Docsy as a git
    submodule, Docsy updates no longer require the `--recursive` flag when
    running `git submodule update`. Consider dropping the flag if you have no
    other recursive git submodules.

Proceed as usual to build or serve your site.

## 0.3.0

For the full list of changes, see the [0.3.0] release notes.

**Breaking changes**:

- Upgrade to
  [Algolia DocSearch v3](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/DocSearch-v3). If
  your site uses the deprecated DocSearch v2, you must
  [update your DocSearch code](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/migrating-from-v2).
- (**Edit**) [#1009] inadvertently changed the base [Bootstrap styles for
  cards][bs4cards], as well as the Docsy `highlight` style. For details, see
  [issue #1154]. Release [0.5.1] includes a fix.

## 0.2.0

For the full list of changes, see the [0.2.0] release notes.

**New**:

- Add official Docsy support for [Hugo modules]. Many thanks to the dedicated
  and patient efforts of [@deining], who researched, experimented, and
  implemented this feature. Thanks to [@deining] and [@LisaFC] for the doc
  updates.
