 Keeping the Docsy theme up to date.

We hope to continue to make improvements to the theme [along with the Docsy community](/docs/contribution-guidelines/). 
If you have cloned the example site (or are otherwise using the theme as a submodule), you can update the Docsy theme
yourself. 

Updating Docsy means that your site will build using the latest version of Docsy at `HEAD` and include 
all the new commits or changes that have been merged since the point in time that you initially added the Docsy 
submodule, or last updated. Updating won't affect any modifications that you made in your own project to 
[override the Docsy look and feel](/docs/adding-content/lookandfeel/), as your overrides 
don't modify the theme itself. For details about what has changed in the theme, see the list of 
[Docsy commits](https://github.com/google/docsy/commits/main).
