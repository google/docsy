  Deploying your Docsy site.

There are multiple possible options for deploying a Hugo site, including Netlify, Firebase Hosting, Bitbucket with Aerobatic, and more; you can read about them all in [Hosting and Deployment](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/). Hugo also makes it easy to deploy your site locally for quick previews of your content.

## Serving your site locally

Depending on your deployment choice you may want to serve your site locally during development to preview content changes. To serve your site locally:

1.  Ensure you have an up to date local copy of your site files cloned from your repo. Don't forget to use `--recurse-submodules` or you won't pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.

    ```
    git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/my/example.git
    ```
   
    {{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
If you've just added the theme as a submodule in a local version of your site and haven't committed it to a repo yet,  you must get local copies of the theme's own submodules before serving your site.
    
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    {{% /alert %}}

1.  Ensure you have the tools described in [Installation and Prerequisites](#installation-and-prerequisites) installed on your local machine, including `postcss-cli` (you'll need it to generate the site resources the first time you run the server).
1.  Run the `hugo server` command in your site root. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/.

Now that you're serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site. If you have more than one local git branch, when you switch between git branches the local website reflects the files in the current branch.

## Deployment with Netlify

We recommend using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as a particularly simple way to serve your site from your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket), with [continuous deployment](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/), previews of the generated site when you or your users create pull requests against the doc repo, and more. Netlify is free to use for Open Source projects, with premium tiers if you require greater support.

Follow the instructions in [Host on Netlify](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/) to set up a Netlify account (if you don't have one already) and authorize access to your GitHub or other Git provider account. Once you're logged in:

1. Click **New site from Git**.
1. Click your chosen Git provider, then choose your site repo from your list of repos.
1. In the **Deploy settings** page:
   1. For your **Build command**, specify `cd themes/docsy && git submodule update -f --init && cd ../.. && hugo`. You need to specify this rather than just `hugo` so that Netlify can use the theme's submodules.
   1. Click **Show advanced**. 
   1. In the **Advanced build settings** section, click **New variable**. 
   1. Specify `HUGO_VERSION` as the **Key** for the new variable, and `0.53` or later as its **Value**. 
1. Click **Deploy site**.

If you have an existing deployment you can view and update the relevant information by selecting the site from your list of sites in Netlify, then clicking **Site settings** - **Build and deploy**. Ensure that **Ubuntu Xenial 16.04** is selected in the **Build image selection** section - if you're creating a new deployment this is used by default. You need to use this image to run the extended version of Hugo.
