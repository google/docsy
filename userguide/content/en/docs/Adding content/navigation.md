## Top-level menu

The top level menu (the one that appears in the top navigation bar for the entire site) uses your site's [`main` menu](https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/). All Hugo sites have a `main` menu array of menu entries, accessible via the `.Site.Menus` site variable and populatable via page front matter or your site's `config.toml`. 

To add a page or section to this menu, add it to the site's `main` menu in either `config.toml` or in the destination page's front matter (in `_index.md` or `_index.html` for a section, as that's the section landing page). For example, here's how we added the Documentation section landing page to the main menu in this site:

```yaml
---
title: "Docsy Documentation"
linkTitle: "Documentation"
menu:
  main:
    weight: 20
---
```

The menu is ordered from left to right by page `weight`. So, for example, a section index or page with `weight: 30` would appear after the Documentation section in the menu, while one with `weight: 10` would appear before it.

If you want to add a link to an external site to this menu, add it in `config.toml`, specifying the `weight`.

```yaml
[[menu.main]]
    name = "GitHub"
    weight = 50
    url = "https://github.com/google/docsy/"
```

### Adding a version drop-down

Depending on your project's releases and versioning, you may want to let your users access "old" versions of your site (how you deploy your archived sites is up to you) to read about previous versions of your project.

If you add some `[params.versions]` in `config.toml`, the Docsy theme adds a version selector drop down to the top-level menu. You specify a URL and a name for each version you would like to add to the menu, as in the following example:

```
# Add your release versions here
[[params.versions]]
  version = "master"
  url = "https://master.kubeflow.org"

[[params.versions]]
  version = "v0.2"
  url = "https://v0-2.kubeflow.org"

[[params.versions]]
  version = "v0.3"
  url = "https://v0-3.kubeflow.org"
```

(don't forget to add your current version so users can navigate back!)

The default version drop-down menu title is `Releases`. To change this, change the `version_menu` parameter in `config.toml`:

```
version_menu = "Releases"
```


### Adding a language drop-down

If you configure more than one language in `config.toml`, the Docsy theme adds a language selector drop down to the top-level menu. Selecting a language takes the user to the translated version of the current page, or the home page for the given language.

You can find out more in [Multi-language support](/docs/language/).

## Section menu

The section menu, as shown in the left side of the `docs` section, is automatically built from the `content` tree. Like the top-level menu, it is ordered by page or section index `weight` (or by page creation `date` if `weight` is not set), with the page or index's `Title`, or `linkTitle` if different, as its link title in the menu. If a section subfolder has pages other than `_index.md` or `_index.html`, those pages will appear as a submenu, again ordered by `weight`. For example, here's the metadata for this page showing its `weight` and `title`:

```yaml
---
title: "Navigation and Search"
linkTitle: "Navigation and Search"
date: 2017-01-05
weight: 3
description: >
  Customize site navigation and search for your Docsy site.
---
```

To hide a page or section from the menu, set `toc_hide: true` in front matter.

By default, the section menu will show the current section fully expanded all the way down. This may make the left nav too long and difficult to scan for bigger sites. Try setting site param `ui.sidebar_menu_compact = true` in `config.toml`.

## Breadcrumb navigation

Breadcrumb navigation is enabled by default. To disable breadcrumb navigation, set site param `ui.breadcrumb_disable = true` in `config.toml`.

## Configure search

By default Docsy uses a [Google Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/all) to search your site. To enable this feature, you'll first need to make sure that you have built a public production version of your site, as otherwise your site won't be crawled and indexed.

### Setting up site search

1.  Deploy your site and ensure that it's built with `HUGO_ENV="production"`, as Google will only crawl and index Docsy sites built with this setting (you probably don't want your not-ready-for-prime-time site to be searchable!). You can specify this variable as a command line flag to Hugo: 

    ```
    $ env HUGO_ENV="production" hugo
    ```

    Alternatively, if you're using Netlify, you can specify it as a Netlify [deployment setting](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#build-environment-variables) in `netlify.toml` or the Netlify UI, along with the Hugo version. It may take a day or so before your site has actual search results available.
2.  Create a Google Custom Search Engine for your deployed site by clicking **New search engine** on the [Custom Search page](https://cse.google.com/cse/all) and following the instructions. Make a note of the ID for your new search engine.
3.  Add any further configuration you want to your search engine using the **Edit search engine** options. In particular you may want to change from the default **Overlay** layout to **Results only**, as this option means your search results are embedded in your search page rather than appearing in a separate box. Click **Save** to save your changes.

### Adding the search page

Once you have your search engine set up, you can add the feature to your site:

1. Ensure you have a Markdown file in `content/en/search.md` (and one per other languages if needed) to display your search results. It only needs a title and `layout: search`, as in the following example:

    ```
    ---
    title: Search Results
    layout: search
    ---
    ```

1. Add your Google Custom Search Engine ID to the site params in `config.toml`. You can add different values per language if needed.

    ```
    # Google Custom Search Engine ID. Remove or comment out to disable search.
    gcs_engine_id = "011737558837375720776:fsdu1nryfng"
    ```

### Disabling search

If you don't specify a Google Custom Search Engine ID for your project, the search box won't appear in your site. If you're using the default `config.toml` from the example site and want to disable search, just comment out or remove the relevant line.

### Disabling the sidebar search box

By default, the search box appears in both the top navigation bar and at the top of the sidebar left navigation pane. If you don't want the sidebar search box, set `sidebar_search_disable` to `true` in `config.toml`:

```
sidebar_search_disable = true
```
