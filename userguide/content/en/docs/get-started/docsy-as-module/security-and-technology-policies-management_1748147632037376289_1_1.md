## Policy

### Policy creation and requirements

All in-scope policies must be created as version controlled documents in GitLab.

All in-scope policies must be listed in the policies section of the CODEOWNERS file with appropriate stakeholders listed as codeowners.

At a minimum, all in-scope policies must include a purpose, scope, roles and responsibilities, and policy statements.

All policy statements for in-scope policies must be mapped to the appropriate [GCF](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/sec-controls/) control(s).

### Policy review and approval

All in-scope policies must be reviewed and approved by appropriate stakeholders prior to merging the initial MR to create the policy.

All in-scope policies must be reviewed and approved by appropriate stakeholders on at least an annual basis in coordination with the [Controlled Document Procedure](/handbook/security/controlled-document-procedure/) annual review.

### Policy communication and training

New and updated policies must be communicated to relevant team members upon creation or material update.

Relevant in-scope policies must be acknowledged by team members during onboarding training and annually thereafter.
