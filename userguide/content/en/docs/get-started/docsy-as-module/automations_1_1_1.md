## What are Zendesk automations?

As per [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408832701850-About-automations-and-how-they-work):

> Automations are similar to triggers because both define conditions and actions that modify ticket properties and optionally send email notifications to customers and agents. Where they differ is that automations execute when a time event occurs after a ticket property was set or updated, rather than immediately after a ticket is created or updated.

The simpler way to think of it is automations are triggers that do not run instantly. They are time based than event based.
