### Ennegram Type 3 with 6 Wing

ðŸ”—[**INFP**: Achiever & Loyalist](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/relationship-type-3-with-type-6/)

Surprisingly, this is not a common pairing, although these two types can work very well as a team. On the positive side, Threes bring hard work, optimism, energy, a desire to communicate to and connect with people, and a feeling of unlimited potential both personally and in the relationship itself. Threes can bring an enormous sense of self-confidence and the hope of success that is assuredâ€”that this relationship is a winning team or that this couple is the best ever! Common goals bring them togetherâ€”they are both practical and want to achieve tangible things in the world.
