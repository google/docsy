### Business Goal

Increase the number of unique monthly contributors by recognizing and incentivizing organizations who are among our most active contributors. This will create internal experts at GitLab organizations and ensure customers see it as their own product. This initiative supports our mission and our [dual flywheel](/handbook/company/strategy/#dual-flywheels) strategy where increasing wider community contributions leads to more users, thus higher revenue.

### Proposed Exit Criteria

Build scalable model to activate 100 Leading Organizations by the end of FY24-Q4.
