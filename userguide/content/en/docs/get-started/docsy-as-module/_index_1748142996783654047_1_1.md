## Summary

This document outlines the technical vision, principles, and key architectural decisions for implementing SLSA Level 3 compliance within GitLab CI/CD pipelines. The solution will provide a reusable, modular, and secure way to generate, sign, and verify provenance for artifacts while hardening pipeline identity and build infrastructure.

## Proposal

We propose a phased implementation of SLSA Level 3 compliance across GitLab CI/CD pipelines using modular and reusable components. Each phase addresses a critical step:

1. In-Pipeline Provenance Generation and Verification using Sigstore: Generate and verify provenance attestation within the pipeline.
1. Generate Provenance Statement in Control Plane: Shift provenance generation from Runner to GitLab Rails backend to enhance trust.
1. Sign Provenance Statement in Control Plane: Move signing operations to dedicated service for better security.
1. KMS Integration for out-of-Pipeline Signing: Enable external, KMS-based artifact signing for enhanced security and compliance.
1. Hardening Pipeline Identity: Strengthen runner identity and build trust into the infrastructure.

This phased approach ensures an MVP can be delivered early, with incremental security and compliance enhancements added over time.

## Goals

- Embed GitLab-specific platform data (pipeline variables, commit IDs) into provenance for traceability.
- Support out-of-pipeline signing via secure KMS or HSM, isolating signing keys from build environments.
- Strengthen runner identity to provide trustworthy attestation of build provenance.
- Align with SLSA Level 3 compliance requirements while minimizing disruption to existing workflows.
- Ensure security, scalability, and ease of adoption across GitLab environments.

## Non-Goals

- Achieving SLSA Level 4 compliance, which requires isolated and verifiable builds (future consideration).
- Collecting dependencies of all possible programming ecosystems (focus on key ecosystems first).
- Replacing GitLab’s existing artifact storage and distribution mechanisms.

## Terminology/Glossary

- SLSA: Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts, a framework for improving supply chain security.
- Provenance predicate: Metadata that describes how an artifact was built, including the source code, dependencies, and environment.
- Provenance statement: Document that binds a provenance predicate to a software artifact.
- Provenance attestation: Envelope that combines a provenance statement with a signature.
- Sigstore: An open-source tool for signing, verifying, and storing software artifacts securely (cosign and gitsign).
- OIDC Token: Short-lived, identity-based tokens issued by GitLab CI for secure signing.
- Runner: A build agent that executes GitLab CI/CD pipeline jobs.
- KMS: Key Management Service, an external system to securely manage cryptographic keys.
- HSM: Hardware Security Module, hardware-based systems for secure key storage and signing.
- VSA: Verification Summary Attestation, an attestation that an artifact has been verified to meet certain requirements.
- GitLab Rails backend: The GitLab Rails backend that provides a trusted environment for security-critical operations, separate from the build environment.
- Signing Service: A dedicated service within the GitLab infrastructure responsible for SLSA statement signing operations, isolated from the CI/CD execution environment.

## Assumptions

- Provenance Generation: Use Sigstore Cosign (CLI, client, or port) to generate provenance attestations.
- OIDC-based keyless signing: Use Signstore Fulcio for OIDC-base keyless signing.
- Transparency log: Use Sigstore Rekor transparency log.
- Signing Methods:
  - In-pipeline signing via OIDC-based short-lived credentials for fast MVP.
  - Out-of-pipeline signing via KMS for long-term secure artifact signing.
- Runner Hardening: Explore options for strong runner identity using hardware-based solutions (TPM, secure enclaves).

## Design Details

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: In-Pipeline Provenance Generation and Verification using Sigstore

- Generate provenance attestations using Sigstore tools (cosign).
- Leverage GitLab CI’s OIDC tokens for secure and short-lived credentials.
- Verify provenance attestations and generate Verification Summary Attestations (VSA).
- Build reusable GitLab CI components that can be easily included in pipelines.

#### Phase 2: Generate Provenance Statement in Control Plane

- Move provenance statement generation to GitLab Rails backend.
- Every field of the provenance is generated or verified in the trusted control plane.
- Generate provenance statements that are unforgeable.

#### Phase 3: Out-of-Pipeline Signing

- Move signing operations from CI/CD pipelines to a signing service running on the backend.
- Enhance security by isolating signing operations from build environment.
- Provide centralized management of signing processes.
- Ensure clean separation between build and signing trust boundaries.

#### Phase 4: KMS Integration for out-of-pipeline Signing

- Enable integration with external KMS (AWS KMS, Google KMS) or HSM solutions.
- Use long-term signing keys stored securely outside the pipeline.
- Support multiple key management solutions to accommodate various enterprise environments.

#### Phase 5: Hardening Pipeline Identity

- Introduce strong runner identity using secure hardware (TPM, HSM, secure boot).
- Embed runner identity into the provenance metadata.
- Ensure that the runner environment is verified and trusted.

#### Follow-up Work: Enhanced Data Collection

- Integrate tools to collect granular build metadata (go mod graph for Go, Maven dependency trees for Java).
- Use GitLab's Virtual Registry (formerly Dependency Proxy) to track resolved dependencies requested by CI/CD build jobs.
- Update provenance structure to include enriched metadata.

### Implementation Details

#### Sigstore and GitLab OIDC Integration

- How Sigstore Will Be Used:
  - Sigstore tools, specifically cosign, will be leveraged to sign and verify provenance.
  - cosign can utilize GitLab CI’s OIDC integration to securely authenticate the job and issue short-lived credentials. These credentials will sign the provenance file.
  - The OIDC token provided by GitLab is scoped to the running pipeline job, making it ephemeral and secure.
- GitLab OIDC Integration Workflow:
  - GitLab generates an OIDC token in the CI component and exposes it as an environment variable.
  - Sigstore’s cosign uses the OIDC token to authenticate the GitLab CI job with Sigstore’s transparency log (Rekor).
  - Sigstore validates the identity and grants signing capability for the duration of the job.
  - cosign generates a signed provenance file (JSON format) and uploads it to GitLab’s artifacts store.
- OIDC Configuration in GitLab:
  - Enable GitLab OIDC support by using the existing ID Token feature.
  - Use GitLab CI/CD’s environment variables to expose tokens and necessary metadata.

#### GitLab CI Components

<details>
<summary>Provenance Signer Component</summary>

The provenance signer component will abstract away the complexity of provenance generation and signing. It will be implemented as a GitLab CI Component using a template YAML file.

**Component Overview**

- Input Variables:
  - TARGET_ARTIFACT: Path to the artifact or build output.
  - BUNDLE_FILE: Path to generate the bundle file. This contains everything needed to verify the artifact.
  - RUNNER_METADATA_FILE: This is the default filename when artifacts aren't explicitly named.
- Output:
  - Signed provenance file uploaded as a pipeline artifact.

**Example reusable Component YAML**

```yaml
# .gitlab/components/provenance-signer.yml

#### Pipeline Workflow Explanation

- Build Artifact Stage (build_artifact):
  - Builds the artifact (binary, container image, etc.).
  - Saves the artifact as a pipeline artifact.
- Provenance Generation Stage (generate_provenance):
  - Uses the provenance-signer component to:
    - Generate a detailed provenance predicate with build metadata.
    - Calculate the artifact's digest for inclusion in the provenance statement.
    - Sign the provenance using Sigstore's cosign with GitLab's OIDC token.
    - Perform self-verification to ensure the provenance is valid.
    - Uploads the signed provenance as a job artifact.
- Publish Artifact Stage (publish_artifact):
  - Publishes the artifact to a registry or repository.
  - Captures the published artifact's URL for use in verification.
  - This stage separates build/sign from verification, ensuring a true separation of concerns.
- Provenance Verification Stage (verify_provenance):
  - Uses the provenance-verifier component to:
    - Download the published artifact from its URL.
    - Download the required verification policy.
    - Verify the signed provenance against the downloaded artifact.
    - Check SLSA L3 requirements in the attestation.
    - Generate a Verification Summary Attestation (VSA).
    - Sign the VSA using Sigstore's cosign with GitLab's OIDC token.
    - Upload the VSA as a job artifact.
    - Fails the job if verification fails, but allows the pipeline to continue.

### Security Considerations

- Ephemeral OIDC Tokens:
  - The ID token is short-lived and scoped to the current job.
  - This ensures it cannot be reused outside the pipeline execution context.
- Artifact and Provenance Storage:
  - Use GitLab’s artifact storage to securely store both the build artifact and the signed provenance file.
  - Artifacts are automatically managed and can be expired after a specified time.
- Isolation:
  - If using shared runners, ensure sandboxed environments (ephemeral containers).
  - Self-hosted runners should follow security best practices to prevent token leakage.
- Dependency Management:
  - Pin specific versions of Sigstore tools (cosign) to prevent supply chain attacks.
- CI Variables:
  - CI Variables will be included in signed provenance file. But will follow the Visibility setting where `Masked` or `Masked and hidden` variables will not store the value, only the key.
- Separation of Concerns:
  - The separation of provenance generation and verification ensures that verification is truly independent.
  - The VSA is generated by the verifier component, providing a clear chain of trust.

### Component Maintenance and Scalability

- Publish the GitLab CI component in a versioned Git repository to ensure teams can pull stable versions.
- Provide clear documentation and examples for adoption.
- Extend the component in later phases to include additional metadata collection and signing enhancements.

### Decisions

- [001: Verification Component](decisions/001_verification_component.md) - Verify SLSA provenance attestations in a dedicated CI/CD component.
- [002: Provenance Generation Location](decisions/002_provenance_generation_location.md) - Generate SLSA provenance statements in the GitLab Rails backend.
