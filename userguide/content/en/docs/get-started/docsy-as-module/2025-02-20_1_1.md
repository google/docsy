## Open Issues:
Alex: WSG Progress Report
* 3 New SC’s (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/#success-criterion-sustainable-apis-machine-testable">Sustainable APIs</a> - we had a listing for sustainable media queries to reduce carbon footprint, so we added one about sust JS, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/#success-criterion-client-vs-server-human-testable">Client VS Server</a> new SC re: redundant processing and whether better to do processing on client or server side, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/#success-criterion-automated-tooling-human-testable">Automated Tooling</a> thanks to Rose, new SC about scrapers and bots and declaration of non-humans for opt-out purposes).
* New <a href = "https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/?tab=readme-ov-file#json-apis">JSON API</a> for <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/star.json">STAR</a> (<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/blob/main/star.json"source</a).
* Jekyll config for HTML friendly versions of our <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-ig/">IG</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/README.html">WSG</a> readme - does not require people to go to GitHub, more user-friendly.
* 6 updated or merged SC’s across Web Dev, Infrastructure, & Business.
** Merged SCs:
*** (former 3.19) into 3.18
** Updated SCs:
*** 2.16, 3.8, 4.2, 4.3, 5.20
* Lots of other bugs and fixes applied & plenty of new URLs.

Task forces: how to jumpstart progress?
* Workload expectations - Infra doing well, metrics needs more clearly defined goal. Discussion about refining goals of the group, clarifying the roles and audiences. Recommendation to share data and background about sustainability (possibly in adjacent docs). For metrics, Important to mention that we are stressing improvement over time instead of an end goal. Mention that we are talking about intensity impact not total impact (e.g. if org grows). 
* Going from 95% to 96% in terms of the quality of the guidelines is great. There is no global report on adoption of digital sustainability. We can talk about anecdotal information, but it’s not enough to give confidence to people taking the first step. We need ROI at scale. There are so many playbooks and guidelines, but perhaps the biggest issue is to convince people to take the first step. Perhaps helping them assess where they are with maturity could be a good idea.
* What if we shift focus of WSG to be a way to test (maybe we GWF and MDN?) to help people come together to report on sustainable web sites? (spitball idea)
* Alex: many SCs are not measurable. We could potentially produce a report similar to the report we did on http archive. If we have some kind of numbers that we are working with then we can say that we could have this (numeric) impact.
* It’s unclear from looking at WSG how to subset the SCs - which are the priorities. (ranking system like A, AA, AAA could be helpful)
* What can we do to help you accomplish tasks between meetings?

Guidelines restructuring discussion
* <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/14#issuecomment-2629405813">Move guideline text into “Additional Content” (discussed last meeting)</a>. proposal to separate non-normative text to separate doc. General consensus 
* <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/14#issuecomment-2662164386">Defaulting to multi-page with full-page option / two spec versions alike WHATWG.</a> Group agrees to multi-page with full-page option.
* <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/14#issuecomment-2612676839">Filtering SC by tag [discipline / category / pathway] (discussed last meeting).</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/14#issuecomment-2668983011">Put references in supplement and group by SC, highlighting best content.</a> Maintenance of links could become challenging, so it will be easier to keep it up to date separately.
* There is interest in grouping by role  - i.e. “I am an API developer”, “I am a UX developer”, “I am a product manager”, where should I look first? So these are easier to digest coming to the WSGs for the first time.
