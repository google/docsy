## Milestones

Each issue and epic gets mapped to the milestone for the time period that most of the work takes place. This is used as our lightweight version of time tracking and capacity planning, and is helpful with roadmap planning.

## Labels and Tags

### Issue Types

You can view the issues with these labels on the [BT Eng Infra - Issue Types](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/2870859) issue board.

These labels can be applied to any issue, MR, or epic in the [gitlab.com/gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com) namespace, which includes the majority of issue trackers used by GitLab team members in child groups and projects.

> <small>**Note:** These labels have not been created for the `gitlab-org` namespace since our team does not work on any projects in that namespace, and it would require the creation of additional issue boards and automation for the separate top-level group.</small>
