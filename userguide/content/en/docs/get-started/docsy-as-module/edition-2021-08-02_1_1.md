**Deal Desk is launching Smart Templates**, which introduce automation into the quoting process and allow ***you*** to automatically add pre-approved legal language to your Order Form via checkbox fields on the quote! As a part of this change, we will no longer require approvals for annual payments on multi-year deals! 🎉

For more information on Smart Templates and self-service legal language, review the [Sales Order Processing handbook page](/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#quote-template-types). For more specific quoting instructions surrounding Smart Templates and self-service legal language, review the [Deal Desk handbook page](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#zuora-quote-configuration-guide---standard-quotes). Reach out in #sales-support if you have any questions.

**We have expanded [Digital Programs content](/handbook/customer-success/csm/digital-journey/) to < $50K ARR, non-CSM assigned accounts in the Enterprise segment**! In addition, we have expanded the scope of eligible customers and will now **require that a GitLab Admin be added to `New - First Order`, `New - Connected` and `Growth` deals** at the time of Opportunity approval submission for non-CSM assigned customers below $50K ARR in the **Commercial and Enterprise segments**.

This means that Digital Programs are now officially available to our entire customer-base of < $50K ARR, non-CSM assigned accounts! See the [technical documentation](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-systems/gtm-technical-documentation/#gitlab-admin-contact-required) and [quick demo video](https://www.loom.com/share/99dbbeacd4b54bfaa27881ccd375cb80). Reach out in #cs-questions.

**The [360 Feedback survey](/handbook/people-group/360-feedback/) launches today (2021-08-02)** and is a great opportunity to help our team members succeed and grow, while also receiving valuable feedback for our own development. Please look out for an email from Culture Amp to start this process. Note that any team member who started after 2021-06-01 will not be automatically included. If you would like to be included, please reach out in #people-connect to be manually added.

### What's New in GitLab 🚀

[GitLab 14.1](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/07/22/gitlab-14-1-released/) includes 50+ improvements to help teams:

- Increase collaboration and visibility for teams that create and manage their own Helm charts with new functionality in the GitLab project to publish and share packaged Helm charts. Learn more about how to develop and deploy cloud native applications with a built-in Helm registry in [this blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/07/26/gitlab-helm-package-registry/).
- Protect their company from missed critical alerts with Escalation Policies that allow customers to manage on-call schedules and create team-boxed escalation steps that will run automatically.
- More easily connect Kubernetes clusters to GitLab CI/CD with the new CI/CD Tunnel for Kubernetes clusters.

To see what's ahead in 14.2, watch the [kickoff video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA_9vgFNHsw) or check out the [kickoff review page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/kickoff/).
