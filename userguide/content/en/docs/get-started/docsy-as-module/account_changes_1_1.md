title: Making Changes and Taking Actions on an Account
category: GitLab.com
subcategory: Accounts
description: "Workflow for when and how to make account changes on behalf of a customer"
---

## Overview

This workflow focuses on the process when action is required by the Support team on behalf of the user.

The main situations where action may need to be taken on behalf of the user:

1. Project/Group Changes
1. Account Access Requests
1. Releasing an Email Address
1. Primary email change of an enterprise user.

### User Action First

Following our [Security Policy on "GitLab's Access to Your Private Repositories"](https://about.gitlab.com/security/faq), actions should always be taken by the user whenever possible.

For example, users should be deleting their own projects, but if they encounter an error with every attempt and there are no workarounds, then Support can intervene [with permission](#asking-permission).

If in doubt, please ask a Support manager to review.

## Project/Group Changes

In cases where Support needs to take action on the project or group, such as for troubleshooting purposes, Support should do two things:

1. Verify the user is a group *Owner* or project *Maintainer*. Otherwise, ask the user to have an owner/maintainer contact us.
1. Ask for permission to take action. See the [Asking Permission](#asking-permission) section below.
1. Consider adding an [Admin Note](/handbook/support/workflows/admin_note) to the group admin page if Support may need to know the action was taken in the future.

You can continue working with the original requester once an owner/maintainer provides permission if that is their preference.

## Account Access Requests

In cases where a user has lost access to their account, all other options (such as SSH recovery codes, password reset) should be exhausted first.

For unconfirmed accounts, the only account action support will typically take is an [email typo fix]({{< ref "confirmation_emails#typo-fix" >}}).

Before taking any action on confirmed accounts, ensure that you have verified the account owner using the [Account Ownership Verification](/handbook/support/workflows/account_verification) workflow.

If ownership is verified, then:

1. [Confirm permission for the changes](#asking-permission).
1. Add an [Admin Note](/handbook/support/workflows/admin_note) to the user's account.

Example cases include:

1. Swapping secondary email with primary email due to primary email being unconfirmed or non-existent. If the requester is a free user, manager approval is needed. Available until [gitlab#416451](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/416451) is implemented.
1. Removing an identity tied to the user account. The identity should also be verified in these cases.

## Releasing an Email Address

Similar to **Account Access Requests**, if a user has lost access to their account and the account shows **no activity** in its history, then we can consider releasing the email address for the user to create a new account with.

We can also use this workflow when a user cannot add an email address to their account because it is on a different account *and* is unverified. This often happens if a user has accidentally created an account using one of the single sign-on registration methods or cannot recall creating the account.

For more information on unverified/unconfirmed accounts, please see the [confirmation emails]({{< ref "confirmation_emails" >}}) workflow.

The primary (for paid users only, all users should be able to get a new confirmation email) and secondary email (for all users until [#367823](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367823) is resolved) can be released following one of the processes below.

### Release an unverified secondary email address

1. Confirm the email address as an unverified secondary email address.
1. If the ticket was submitted via the ZD form, please perform an email verification.
1. Once the user has replied to confirm they own the email address, remove the secondary email from the account
1. Add an Admin Note to the user’s account: `2024-01-30 | removed secondary unverified email address from the account john@xyz.com| https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/`
1. Reply to the user saying that their email address is now releasd and they can use it to create a new account.
1. Comment on this feature request

### Release an email address for an inactive account

#### Verify account status and ownership

Check the user's activity page:

1. If an account shows any activity tied to any type of contribution (such as snippets, or comments in a project or group), use the [Account Ownership Verification]({{< ref "account_verification" >}}) workflow to verify ownership.
1. If the account shows **no** activity:
1. Confirm that the email address the user is trying to add exists on a different account.
1. Verify that the account shows **no activity** and is not a member of any projects or groups. Additionally, confirm that the following are true:
      - The user is unverified
      - The user has never logged in
      - The user has no data (No groups or projects)
1. If the account **is** verified or data exists, inform the original requestor that the email is **not eligible** for release. They can [request an account deletion](/handbook/support/workflows/personal_data_access_account_deletion#zendesk) if necessary.

#### If eligible for email release

1. If applicable, add the new email address as a CC to the ticket and ask the user to respond to the ticket from the email address they wish to add.
1. Once the user has replied to confirm they own the email address, update the email address with `+release`. For example, if the email address is `johndoe@example.com`, then update the email address on the account to `johndoe+release@example.com`.
    - This can be done with Admin access or [via Chatops]({{< ref "chatops#Update-a-Users-Primary-Email" >}})
1. Add an [Admin Note]({{< ref "admin_note" >}}) to the user's account.
1. Advise the customer to add the newly released email address again to their primary account.
1. Consider commenting on [this feature request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352514)

## Change primary email address of enterprise users

Enterprise users [cannot modify their primary email address to an email with a non-verified domain](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/enterprise_user/#primary-email-change). An enterprise user can only change their primary email to an email their organization owns as per its verified domains. An enterprise user or a top level group owner can reach out to Support to request primary email address change.
**Note that changing the primary email address to an email that is not part of the group domain verification will disassociate the user**: the user will no longer be an enterprise user.

### Request from a top level group owner

Until [the issue 412966](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/412966) is implemented, top level group owners are not able to change their enterprise users primary email address. They can request support to change the primary email of one or more enterprise user(s).

1. Check the [Account Verification Matrix for eligibility](/handbook/support/workflows/account_verification#account-verification-matrix).
1. Ask manager approval to proceed
1. Use the [Account Ownership Verification workflow](/handbook/support/workflows/account_verification) to verify ownership.
1. If successful:

> Greetings,
>
> Thank you, we were able to verify your identity as account owner.
>
> Could you please confirm that you would like us to change the enterprise user primary address from example@primary-email.address to example@new-primary-email address ? Replying in this ticket stating you provide permission will be sufficient.
>
> [Important notice](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/enterprise_user/#dissociation-of-the-user-from-their-enterprise-group): Changing an enterprise user’s primary email to an email with a non-verified domain automatically disassociates them from their enterprise group. As a result of the change, your organization will **not** be able to manage the user account and GitLab Support will not intervene for any reason.

1. Update the primary email address of the enterprise user(s).
1. Add an Admin Note to the user’s account(s).

### Request from an enterprise user that may or may not be part of the group

Enterprise users have user accounts that are administered by an organization that has purchased a GitLab subscription. This means Support is not taking action without the explicit permission of one of the top level group owners.

1. Send the snippet below as an initial answer:

> Greetings,
>
> Your account is an enterprise user account, [enterprise users cannot modify their primary email address to an email with a non-verified domain](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/enterprise_user/#primary-email-change). An enterprise user can only change their primary email to an email their organization owns as per its verified domains.
> Updating your primary email address to an email with a non-verified domain will automatically disassociate you from your enterprise group.
>
> If you still wish to update your primary email, address please note it will require involvement of a top level group owners. Please let us know if you wish to proceed.

1. If they answer that they wish to proceed, use the [Account Ownership Verification workflow](/handbook/support/workflows/account_verification) to verify ownership.

1. Ask manager approval to proceed if the primary email is the only verified email (skip this step if it's an email swap request).

1. If successful, contact Owner:

- Create a new Zendesk ticket with the top level group owner’s email address as the requester (found in admin) by following [this specific workflow to create ticket and user](/handbook/support/readiness/operations/docs/zendesk/tickets/#creating-tickets-for-outbound-requests)
- Apply the macro `General::Outbound Contact Request` that ensure the new ticket routes properly and the end-user we wish to contact receives the correct notification.
- Copy the snippet below and mark the ticket as `On-hold`:

> Hi,
>
> We're contacting you because we've received a request from one of your enterprise users <username and email address> to modify their primary email address to an email address with a non-verified domain. This will disassociate the user from your organization: the user will no longer be an enterprise user.
>
> As you will lose any current and future administration of the user account following this change, we are asking for your permission. Replying in this ticket stating you provide permission will be sufficient.

- Make an internal comment providing a link to the requester’s ticket.
- If the group contains multiples owners, choose one owner (preferably an existing support contact) as the requester and CC the others. Limit to 5 owners if more (you can pick the owners that have the most recent Last activity in the page `https://gitlab.com/groups/<group_name>/-/group_members` or/and the owner(s) that is(are) listed as Source).

1. Requester’s Ticket:

   - Add as an internal comment the ticket created above.
   - Reply to the requester with the snippet below and mark the ticket as `On-hold`.

   > Hi,
   >
   > Thanks for verifying your account with us. We are now waiting for permission from your organization to release the account by updating your primary email address.
   > We will keep you updated.

1. If one of the owners approve, update the primary email address of the enterprise user by swapping with a secondary if applicable.
1. Add an [Admin Note]({{< ref "admin_note.md" >}}) to the user’s account.

## Account Ownership Changes

There are some conditions under which a change of ownership may be requested by a company with a business relationship with GitLab. Our [support page](https://about.gitlab.com/support/gitlab-com-policies/#ownership-disputes) outlines that these processes are not available for unpaid groups.

The outcome of a successful request is a new or existing user in the namespace will have the Owner role.

### Account Ownership Change Request for Paid Groups

Account Ownership Change Requests are initiated when the sole Owner of a group leaves a company and an authorized representative of the company is seeking to regain control. This process should be a last resort, and self-service options must first be explored.

**If a request is received, verify:**

1. Current paid subscription is applied to the namespace.
1. Sole Owner's primary email address matches company domain.
1. Requestor has a GitLab.com account. Typically this user will already be a member but is not an Owner.

**Ensure that the requestor has exhausted all self-service options:**

- If the existing Owner's account does not have 2FA enabled, suggest that the requestor issue a password reset to the existing Owner's account, and [claim the account](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/manage.html#change-the-owner-of-a-group).
- If the existing Owner's account has 2FA enabled, suggest the requestor contact the existing Owner to request that the existing Owner provide the one time password, backup codes, or private ssh key to allow the requestor to regain access, and [claim the account](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/manage.html#change-the-owner-of-a-group).

**If no self-service options are viable, follow the steps below:**

1. Use the `Support::SaaS::Gitlab.com::Account Ownership Change Request (Self-Service Not Possible)` [macro](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/zendesk-global/macros/-/blob/master/active/Support/SaaS/GitLab.com/Account%20Ownership%20Change%20Request%20(Self-Service%20Not%20Possible).md?ref_type=heads), adding the account owner or account manager in CC if possible.
1. Once you have received the requested document, verify that all of the necessary information is included. If not, follow up with the requestor to obtain any outstanding information. Once the required information has been obtained, carefully follow the next steps.
1. Assess the request to verify if the following criteria have been met:
   1. Self-service options have been suggested and aren’t viable.
   1. The requested document is completely and correctly populated, and is on appropriate letterhead.
   1. The existing Owner has not been active during the last 90 days.
   1. The requestor is using an email address on the same customer email domain as the existing Owner.
   1. The requestor already holds a Maintainer role within the group.
   1. Independent online search analysis supports the information provided (such as: the existing Owner no longer works for the customer; the roles and positions held at the organization by the requestor and signer; and there is no indication of an internal dispute between the requestor and the existing Owner).
1. **If all criteria are met:** [elevate the requestor to Owner role](#how-to-elevate-the-requestor-to-the-owner-role).
1. **If any criteria is NOT met:**
   1. Create a new [Group Owner Change issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/issues/new?issuable_template=group-owner-change) in the [Legal and Compliance project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance);
   1. Add a link to the issue to the Zendesk ticket;
   1. Reply to the requestor using the `Legal::General` [macro](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+360056569419) and set the ticket to "On-Hold". If you don't receive a reply after the On-Hold ticket reverts to open (4 days), ping in the `#legal` [Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C78E74A6L).
   1. After receiving approval from Legal, [elevate the requestor to Owner role](#how-to-elevate-the-requestor-to-the-owner-role).
1. Add an [Admin note]({{< ref "admin_note" >}}) on the group admin page.

#### How to elevate the requestor to the Owner role

1. Using a GitLab `Admin Account`, go to the requestor's 'Namespace - Group - Members' section.
1. Search for the member by name or email address; in the `Max role` column, change the requestor's role to `Owner`.
1. If the requestor is not a member of the group, then press the `Invite members` button at the top right, enter the requestor's email address, and set the role to `Owner`. Press the `Invite` button to save your changes.

## How is permission given for troubleshooting?

The Support team will not view any private information unless required to resolve an issue. Typically, the issue is filed by the account holder (for users) or valid members of the namespace (for projects and groups) via a support ticket for troubleshooting purposes as outlined in [Security Policy on "GitLab's Access to Your Private Repositories"](https://about.gitlab.com/security/faq).

A Support team member may look at information on pages not explicitly mentioned in the request, but will limit the scope of the review to the minimum access required to solve any issues.

The Support team will only take action from the requester if they:

- Are a member of the namespace.
- Have a problem that requires Support to investigate.
- Provide a link to the namespace.
  - This link can come from the initial form submission or a response in the ticket.

We expect users to provide specific links in order to focus on the related views and logs while investigating an issue. For example, a request to look into a CI/CD error should include links to the relevant job logs, pipelines, and/or CI YAML file.

Any time user data needs to be downloaded (such as cloning a repository), or where secrets must be revealed (such as [CI/CD Variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/)), to further troubleshoot, requires [explicit permission](#asking-permission) before continuing. Any user data that has been downloaded for reproduction purposes must be deleted when the issue is resolved, for example with [our `zd-dl-wiper` tool](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/zd-dl-wiper#zd-dl-wiper).

## Asking Permission

Before any actions are taken, please request explicit permission to take the required action. Be as specific as possible so that there is no confusion.

Once permission is confirmed by the user, then you may proceed.

Some sample phrases:

> Could you please provide permission for Support to ... ?

or

> Could you please confirm that you would like us to ... ?

Some examples:

> Could you please provide permission for Support to re-run one or more pipelines in project `xyz` to investigate the issue you've described? Replying in this ticket stating you provide permission will be sufficient.
>
> Could you please provide permission for our Support Engineers to look at the CI/CD variables in the project so that we confirm they are correct? Replying in this ticket stating you provide permission will be sufficient.
>
> Could you please confirm that you would like us to exchange your primary address `example@primary-email.address` and secondary address `example@secondary-email.address` on your account? Replying in this ticket stating you provide permission will be sufficient.

### Impersonating

Impersonating a user is considered performing an action as another account, impersonating will update the **Current sign-in IP** and **Current sign-in at** for the impersonated user.

When impersonating a user, the administrator account will receive a slack message from the **SIRTbot** app asking to confirm if the impersonation was a legit action.

The action of impersonation is in accordance with our [Confidentiality Terms of the Subscription Agreement](/handbook/legal/subscription-agreement/#7-confidentiality).
