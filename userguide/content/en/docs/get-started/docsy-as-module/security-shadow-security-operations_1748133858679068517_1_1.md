## Security Incident Response Team (SIRT)

GitLab's Security Incident Response Team is the first line of defense for the GitLab SaaS and GitLab as an organization. The primary goal of SIRT is to minimize and control damage from security incidents. This is accomplished through the development and deployment of detection tools to identify when a security incident has occurred, taking action to identify and contain the event to limit its scope and impact, remediating the underlying issue that led to the security event, and recovering from the security event so that operations can return to normal. In addition to responding to incidents, the SIRT works to proactively prevent security incidents through the management and deployment of cyber defense tools, ensuring compliance with security best practices for our infrastructure and team members, and maintenance and training around the incident response process.
