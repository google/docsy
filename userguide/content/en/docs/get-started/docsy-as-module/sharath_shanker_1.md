### About me

- Based in Bangalore,Karnataka,India but I grew up in Kerala,India.
- I am married with two daughters.
- Someone who loves to travel

### My GitLab story

I have been at GitLab since July 2024. As a Business System Analyst on the Entapps Team, I specialize in Salesforce system analysis, requirements gathering, solution design, and process optimization to support business operations and drive efficiency improvements.

### My Work Style & Communication

Collaboration and communication are key in my line of work as I partner with stakeholders to understand their needs in depth. My workday mostly runs from 11:00 AM IST to 8:00 PM IST, though I often extend beyond these hours to accommodate necessary meetings across time zones. I dedicate a significant portion of my time to detailed analysis, creating user stories, designing process flows, and developing mind maps, while the remainder is spent in meetings with business stakeholders and development teams. I do check both slack and emails regularly, although I would prefer tagging me in slack for quick response.

### What I am working on today

I primarily focus on corporate priority projects while also supporting operational initiatives within the Lead to Quote portfolio.
