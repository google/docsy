Notion System Overview 





### 

Active, short-term outcomes we are working toward (e.g. "Sustainable Events Campaign Q3"). These are time-bound and goal-oriented. Each project has:

- A dedicated page with goals, timelines, milestones

- Tasks linked via Notion database (Kanban or Table view)

- Links to relevant Resources and Areas

### Areas

Ongoing responsibilities we manage over time (e.g. "Finance", "Marketing", "HR"). These contain systems and SOPs for ongoing functions.


Examples:

- Marketing (campaign strategy, social media calendar)

- Operations (sustainability metrics, ISO processes)

- Finance (budget tracking, invoicing template)

### Resources

Non-actionable reference material (e.g. articles, research, reports, templates, inspiration, SOPs). We use tags and link these into Projects and Areas as needed.

### Archives

Completed or inactive items—past projects, sunset campaigns, outdated documents. We use an archive database to keep the workspace clean while maintaining access to historical knowledge.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Note-Taking: Zettelkasten Method

We use a Zettelkasten-style approach to knowledge management:

- Notes are atomic and evergreen (one idea per note)

- Each note has a unique ID (e.g. ZK20250416-A)

- All notes are interlinked via backlinks and tags

- We differentiate between Literature Notes (summary of content) and Permanent Notes (ideas we develop and reuse)

We maintain a "Zettelkasten" database in Notion with views for:

- Literature notes (summarised research, reading)

- Permanent notes (conceptual thinking, development)

- Fleeting notes (temporary thoughts)

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Task Management: Eisenhower Matrix & Kanban

We manage tasks using a combination of:

### Eisenhower Matrix

Tasks are triaged into 4 quadrants:

1. Urgent + Important – Do immediately

1. Important but Not Urgent – Schedule

1. Urgent but Not Important – Delegate

1. Neither – Eliminate

We use a Notion database with a template that auto-sorts tasks by quadrant. This helps us prioritise work mindfully.

### Kanban Boards

Each project has a Kanban board with the following columns:

- Backlog

- Ready

- In Progress

- Waiting/Blocked

- Complete

We also use a team-wide board for weekly sprint planning.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Dashboards

Our dashboards act as command centres for focus and visibility.

### Top-Level Company Dashboard

- Quick links to key projects and areas

- KPI widgets (OKRs, sustainability targets, revenue, carbon footprint)

- Team announcements, reminders, and quarterly focus

### Individual Dashboards

Each team member has a custom dashboard:

- Weekly to-dos

- Eisenhower matrix

- Personal calendar

- Quick capture inbox

### Onboarding Dashboard

- Welcome note

- Mission, values, and CSR commitments

- Key SOPs and policies

- First-week checklist

- Role-specific resources
