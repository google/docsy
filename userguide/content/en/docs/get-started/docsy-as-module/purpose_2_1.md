## Purpose

GitLab’s purpose is to help people increase their lifetime earnings through access to opportunities and the DevSecOps platform.

## Identifying GitLab's Purpose

GitLab's purpose lies at the intersection of these four circles.

1. World Needs:
    1. Individual progress (training and access to opportunities)
    1. Organization progress ([DevSecOps Platform](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/devops-platform/), faster iteration)
1. Company skill: iteration (fast innovation, open source contributions)
1. Passionate about: open (to contributions, transparency)
1. Economic value: bundling into a single application

## How we support the purpose

### Training

Our knowledge sharing empowers everyone, not only to GitLab team members but also the world, through inclusive learning opportunities, mentorship programs, and transparently sharing how we operate.

### Access to Opportunities

We empower how people work by providing thought leadership on remote work which spreads job opportunities more evenly across geographies, contributions to open source, and job access programs.

#### All-remote

1. Enable more companies to work remotely, which spreads job opportunities more evenly globally across regions and countries

## Cadence and Alignment

Our purpose is on a 30 year cadence

### Mission

Our purpose informs [our mission](/handbook/company/mission), and our mission is the way we realize our purpose. [Our mission](/handbook/company/mission) is to make it so **everyone can contribute** by using our product, to our product, and to our company.

By making it so **everyone can contribute**, we increase access for people to be creators. With more contributors and more creators, we increase both the volume and velocity of innovation. More innovation drives economic progress that [benefits consumers, businesses, and the economy as a whole](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/educational/explainers/tell-me-more/html/growth.en.html). As a result, innovation both directly and indirectly increases the total volume of available opportunities and average value of each individual opportunity.

Access to a broader set of more valuable opportunities ultimately **increases people's lifetime earnings**.

[Our mission](/handbook/company/mission) is on the same 30 year cadence as our purpose. Our purpose informs our mission, which directly or indirectly informs the rest of the items in [our cadence](/handbook/company/cadence/). As a result, our purpose indirectly informs all of the items in [our cadence](/handbook/company/cadence/), and progress for the items on our [cadence page](/handbook/company/cadence/) like [Yearlies](/handbook/company/yearlies/) creates progress for both our mission and purpose.
