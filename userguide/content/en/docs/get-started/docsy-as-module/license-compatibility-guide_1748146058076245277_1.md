## Understanding Contribution License Agreements at a Glance

| Type of Contribution | Who's Contributing | Governing Agreement |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| MIT-licensed code | Individual | DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) |
| MIT-licensed code | Corporation | DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) |
| EE-directory code | Individual | Individual CLA |
| EE-directory code | Corporation | Corporate CLA |

## Licensing Approach for Co-Create

**Key Points to Understand**:

- No pre-approval process is required before teams can start contributing during Co-Create engagements
- Contributors automatically accept the governing agreement (DCO or CLA) through submission of a contribution
- The code location determines which agreement applies (MIT-licensed = DCO, EE-directory = CLA)

**For Corporations who require an overarching CLA**:

- Some organizations may wish to execute an overarching Corporate CLA that governs all contributions made on behalf of the corporation in order to manage who is authorized to contribute on behalf of the corporation.
- In these cases, GitLab offers an optional overarching Corporate CLA

## Managing Corporate Contributions

For organizations participating in Co-Create, there are two paths:

1. **Standard Contribution Path**:
   - Employees can immediately begin contribute to GitLab code
   - By contributing, they automatically accept the governing license agreement
   - No pre-approval or formal setup required

2. **Formal CLA Management (Optional)**:
   - For organizations requiring explicit contributor management
   - Contact cla_managers@gitlab.com to initiate the formal Corporate CLA process
   - GitLab creates a dedicated group at gitlab.com/gitlab-corporate-cla/[your-company]
   - Your organization designates administrators to manage authorized contributors

**Average timeline**: 2-3 weeks from initial contact to full approval
