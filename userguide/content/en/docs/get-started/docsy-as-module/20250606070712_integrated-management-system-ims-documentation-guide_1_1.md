## Green Orbit Digital’s Framework Integrated Management System (IMS)

At Green Orbit Digital, we recognise the need for a cohesive, agile, and intelligent management system that enables sustainable growth, ensures compliance, and supports digital governance. To fulfil this, we’ve developed a Framework Integrated Management System (IMS) within Notion—our dynamic digital workspace that centralises all key business functions.

Our IMS isn’t just a document repository. It’s a living, strategic framework that aligns policies, procedures, and performance across quality, sustainability, information security, HR, finance, partnerships, innovation, and risk. It allows us to deliver high-impact services that are efficient, ethical, and future-ready.

- Facilitating Continuous Improvement: Enables agile adaptations based on performance data, audits, and feedback.

- Strengthening Risk Management: Connects strategy with operational controls to proactively manage risks.

## Green Orbit Digital’s Framework Integrated Management System (IMS) in Notion

At Green Orbit Digital, we recognise the need for a cohesive, agile, and intelligent management system that supports sustainable growth, cross-functional collaboration, and compliance with international standards. To achieve this, we have developed a Framework Integrated Management System (IMS) within Notion—a dynamic digital workspace that centralises key business operations and governance frameworks.

This system goes beyond traditional document repositories. It is an active, living framework designed to synchronise our policies, procedures, and performance across quality, sustainability, information security, finance, HR, business continuity, partnerships, and innovation. Our IMS underpins the delivery of high-quality, secure, and ethically responsible services.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Why Notion?

Notion serves as the digital backbone of our IMS because of its flexibility, collaborative features, and structured yet customisable databases. It allows us to:

- Centralise knowledge and reduce duplication

- Link policies and procedures directly to active projects and workflows

- Provide tiered access for document sensitivity (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)

- Integrate compliance monitoring, training, onboarding, and audit preparation

- Maintain a single source of truth across departments
