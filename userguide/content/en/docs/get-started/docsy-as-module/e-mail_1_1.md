## Overview

## Workflow

Respond to e-mails sent to our `community@`, `education@`, `merch@`, `opensource@`, `startups@` addresses. Deprecated e-mail aliases: `movingtogitlab@`, `swag@shop.gitlab.com`. You might still receive occasional e-mails from those addresses. If you do, please reply from the appropriate active e-mail address from within Zendesk.

;"></i> Please ensure that all e-mail traffic happens within Zendesk. This enables team members to collaborate on tickets, to bring visibility on conversations, and to make our response time metrics more accurate.

## Best practices

### Setting up aliases

If, for some reason you absolutely need to use your own `@gitlab.com` e-mail account to reply to a request otherwise tracked as a Zendesk ticket, please set up and use e-mail aliases as instructed on this video. This will make the conversation to be managed as a ticket in Zendesk, as opposed to privately on your personal inbox:
