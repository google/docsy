A Biodiversity Impact Assessment (BIA) framework helps Green Orbit Digital identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential impacts on biodiversity due to its operations, products, or services. The framework will guide the company in ensuring that all activities are environmentally responsible and aligned with sustainability goals.

### 1. Introduction to the Biodiversity Impact Assessment

1.1 Purpose of the Assessment

The primary goal is to assess the potential impacts of Green Orbit Digital’s operations on local and global biodiversity. This includes direct and indirect effects on species, ecosystems, and natural resources.

1.2 Scope of the Assessment

This assessment covers the company’s physical operations (offices, data centres, production facilities) as well as the supply chain, including sourcing materials and partnerships.

### 2. Baseline Biodiversity Data Collection

2.1 Site Selection & Identification

Identify all key areas where Green Orbit Digital operates or influences biodiversity. This includes corporate offices, data centres, and locations where suppliers or contractors operate.

2.2 Data Collection Methods

Collect baseline data on the biodiversity in these areas. Use methods like:

- Field surveys

- Remote sensing data (e.g., satellite imagery, GIS tools)

- Local biodiversity registers

- Consultation with environmental experts and local communities

2.3 Local Biodiversity Mapping

Use GIS mapping tools to map biodiversity hotspots, sensitive ecosystems, endangered species, and habitats surrounding your operations or supply chain activities.

### 3. Identification and Evaluation of Potential Impacts

3.1 Direct Impacts

Evaluate the direct impacts of Green Orbit Digital’s operations on local biodiversity. These may include:

- Habitat loss or fragmentation due to construction, land use, or infrastructure development.

- Pollution (e.g., air, water, noise) from office activities, transportation, or data centres.

- Invasive species: Unintended introduction of non-native species through supply chain practices.

3.2 Indirect Impacts

Consider indirect impacts that may arise from business activities, such as:

- Climate change: Emissions from Green Orbit Digital’s operations contributing to global warming, affecting biodiversity.

- Supply Chain Influence: The sourcing of raw materials (e.g., timber, minerals) that may harm ecosystems or wildlife habitats.

- Resource consumption: High energy and water usage impacting local ecosystems.

3.3 Cumulative Impacts

Evaluate cumulative biodiversity impacts from multiple sources or long-term effects. Consider the combined effects of the company’s operations and other nearby activities.

### 4. Impact Assessment Methodology

4.1 Qualitative Assessment

Assess the significance of identified impacts based on expert opinion and community input. Categorise the impacts as:

- Minor: No noticeable effect on biodiversity.

- Moderate: Potential for localized impact with mitigation.

- Major: Significant risk of loss or degradation of biodiversity.

4.2 Quantitative Assessment

Where feasible, use quantitative methods (e.g., population modelling, ecosystem service valuation) to assess the potential loss or degradation of biodiversity. This could include:

- Area of land disturbed

- Species population decline or habitat fragmentation

- Carbon footprint contribution

4.3 Sensitivity and Vulnerability

Assess the sensitivity of species and ecosystems to business activities. Prioritise ecosystems and species that are threatened, rare, or critical for ecosystem services.

### 5. Mitigation and Management Plan

5.1 Avoidance Measures

Where possible, avoid activities that may harm biodiversity. This could include:

- Avoiding sensitive habitats: Relocating operations or avoiding areas rich in biodiversity, such as wetlands, forests, or coastal areas.

- Sourcing responsibly: Ensuring that all raw materials are obtained from suppliers who use sustainable practices and do not contribute to habitat destruction.

5.2 Minimisation Measures

If impacts cannot be avoided, minimise them through:

- Energy and water efficiency: Reducing resource consumption to lessen environmental strain.

- Pollution reduction: Implementing waste minimisation strategies, emission reductions, and filtering processes.

- Buffer zones: Establishing buffer zones around sensitive habitats or biodiversity-rich areas to reduce the operational impact.

5.3 Restoration and Compensation

Where negative impacts occur, restoration and compensation activities should be implemented, including:

- Habitat restoration: Partnering with local environmental NGOs or government bodies to restore degraded ecosystems.

- Biodiversity offset programs: Invest in or participate in biodiversity conservation initiatives that compensate for the negative impacts.

5.4 Long-term Monitoring

Establish a system to monitor biodiversity health over time, ensuring that mitigation measures are effective and that biodiversity is recovering. Use:

- Regular field surveys

- Stakeholder feedback (e.g., local communities)

- Periodic updates to biodiversity maps and reports.

### 6. Stakeholder Engagement

6.1 Internal Stakeholders

Engage employees in biodiversity initiatives, encouraging sustainability through internal policies, training, and corporate responsibility programs.

6.2 External Stakeholders

Engage local communities, regulators, and environmental organisations to ensure the biodiversity assessment is comprehensive and reflects local needs. This may include:

- Consultation with local environmental groups or authorities to assess current biodiversity issues in the area.

- Public reporting and disclosure of impact findings and mitigation efforts.

6.3 Collaboration with Experts

Collaborate with external biodiversity experts, ecologists, and consultants to ensure that the impact assessment is scientifically rigorous and comprehensive.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 7. Reporting and Transparency

7.1 Annual Reporting

Report on biodiversity impacts, mitigation measures, and monitoring results annually. Ensure this information is transparent and accessible to the public, regulators, and other stakeholders.

7.2 Continuous Improvement

Assess the effectiveness of the BIA framework and make improvements based on feedback, monitoring results, and new scientific findings. This ensures Green Orbit Digital adapts to changing environmental conditions and improves biodiversity performance over time.

### 8. Conclusion

The Biodiversity Impact Assessment Framework helps Green Orbit Digital systematically identify and mitigate biodiversity risks in its operations. By understanding and actively managing the potential impacts on local ecosystems, the company can ensure it meets both regulatory requirements and its sustainability goals, while contributing positively to environmental conservation efforts.
