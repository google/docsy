### Questions I Ask Myself

These questions are drawn from Gay Hendricks' book [The Big Leap](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6391876-the-big-leap):

* What work do you do that doesn't seem like work?
  * career development - for teammates and myself
  * process improvements - thinking systematically and asking questions about alternatives
  * document reviews and revamps (I love to read!)
* In your work, what produces the highest ratio of abundance and satisfaction to the amount of time spent?
  * 1:1 meetings with teammates - building connection
  * creating processes, documents, and guidelines that enable others to achieve work goals
  * any activity that brings together diverse viewpoints and geographically distributed teammates
* What is your unique ability?
  * fostering team camaraderie that endures over time
