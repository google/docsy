## Tanuki Tech

Tanuki Tech (short for "Tanuki Instutite of Technology") is the world class sales/technology bootcamp that we are provide for the sales development organization. Our goal is to powerfully equip our sales development team members to be successful in their current role as well as prepare them for their next role, whatever that may be. **We are doing this because we care about our team members.**

## Goals

How do we measure success? The specific goals for this program are:

* Increased sales development effectiveness and organizational efficiency (increased quota attainment).
* Decrease time to value for sales development new hires (we want to equip our new team members to be successful quickly).
* **Job placement for team members who complete our program.** We want the people that we develop here as part of our sales development program to be abundantly prepared for their next role whether that's in sales, marketing, or somewhere else.

The average coding bootcamp here in the United States costs 13.5k and graduates report an average starting salary of 67k (CourseReport 2020). Our goal is to far exceed the job placement and starting salary metrics of our peer institutions, **completely as a free value to our team members as part of being part of this organization.**

## Guiding Principles

* Enablement should be powerful and effective. If there is something that you feel would help our organization and is currently missing or have suggestions for improvement, let us know.
* Enablement should be quick and effective. We are not trying to inundate you with information to eat up all of your time. Most courses in our curriculum are designed to take up around two hours including examination.
* We test often and we test behaviors that apply to your actual job. Research shows that the most effective teachers consistently test more than their peers. **Do not get discouraged if you fail a test; it is better to fail in front of a peer who is trying to help you than in front of a customer.**
* Classes are generally offered in hybrid format (live and recorded options). Examinations are mostly offered in a written format.
* All classes are available on demand. Recordings and assets (slides, exams) are listed [here](https://levelup.gitlab.com/pages/sales-development) under "Sales Development."
