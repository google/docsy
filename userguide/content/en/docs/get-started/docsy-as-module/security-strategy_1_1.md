Comprehensive Security Strategy for Green Orbit Digital

1. Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, security is a fundamental aspect of safeguarding an organisation's assets, data, and reputation. As Green Orbit Digital expands its presence in the space industry, ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of sensitive information becomes increasingly important. This strategy is designed to address both current and emerging security challenges, ensuring a robust defence against threats while enabling business growth.

1. Security Vision and Objectives

The vision for Green Orbit Digital’s security strategy is to create a secure, resilient, and compliant digital environment that protects the company's information assets from both internal and external threats. The primary objectives of this strategy are:

Data Protection: Safeguard sensitive information, including client data, intellectual property, and business-critical systems.

Risk Mitigation: Identify and address security risks proactively to reduce the potential impact of cyberattacks, data breaches, and other threats.

Compliance and Regulatory Adherence: Ensure alignment with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards, such as GDPR, ISO 27001, and NIST.

Business Continuity: Establish a security framework that supports the company’s business continuity and disaster recovery needs.

Security Culture: Foster a culture of security awareness throughout the organisation, where security becomes an integral part of all business processes.

1. Governance and Leadership

Effective governance is critical to the success of a security strategy. The security governance framework at Green Orbit Digital is structured as follows:

Chief Information Security Officer (CISO): The CISO will oversee the overall security strategy and ensure it aligns with business goals. This role will be responsible for implementing the strategy, leading security initiatives, and reporting to senior management.

Security Steering Committee: A cross-functional team, including representatives from IT, HR, legal, operations, and compliance, will meet regularly to review security issues, track progress, and manage risks.

Security Champion Network: This network of employees across departments will promote security awareness, act as a liaison for security issues, and assist in training initiatives.

1. Risk Management Framework

Green Orbit Digital’s approach to managing security risks is built on a comprehensive risk management framework, which includes:

Risk Assessment: Regular risk assessments will be conducted to identify vulnerabilities and threats, assess the likelihood and impact of security incidents, and prioritise mitigation efforts. The assessments will focus on critical systems, data, and infrastructure.

Risk Treatment: Based on the results of the risk assessments, security controls will be applied using the following strategies:

Risk Avoidance: Eliminate or avoid activities that introduce unacceptable levels of risk.

Risk Mitigation: Apply technical, administrative, and physical controls to reduce risks to an acceptable level.

Risk Transfer: Transfer risk through insurance or third-party contracts, where applicable.

Risk Acceptance: Accept risks when the costs of mitigation are disproportionate to the potential impact, ensuring they are documented and monitored.

1. Security Controls

The strategy for securing Green Orbit Digital’s assets is grounded in a multi-layered security approach, ensuring that no single point of failure compromises the organisation’s security. Key areas include:

Perimeter Security: Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) will be deployed to protect the network perimeter. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) will be used for secure remote access.

Endpoint Security: All devices that connect to the corporate network will have endpoint protection software, such as antivirus, anti-malware, and device encryption, to prevent unauthorised access and mitigate threats from malware.

Access Control: Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to restrict access based on job responsibilities. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be used for all critical applications and systems, especially for administrative access.

Data Encryption: All sensitive data will be encrypted at rest and in transit, ensuring that data remains protected even if compromised. Encryption keys will be managed securely to avoid unauthorised decryption.

Backup and Disaster Recovery: Regular backups will be taken for all critical systems and data. These backups will be encrypted and stored in multiple locations to ensure data recovery in the event of an attack or disaster. A disaster recovery plan (DRP) and business continuity plan (BCP) will be in place to guide recovery efforts.

Vulnerability Management: Regular vulnerability scanning and patch management processes will be implemented to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and networks.

Monitoring and Incident Response: Continuous monitoring of IT infrastructure, networks, and endpoints will be conducted using Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. In the event of a security incident, an incident response (IR) plan will be activated to manage the response, containment, and resolution of security breaches.

1. Compliance and Standards

Green Orbit Digital will comply with relevant legal, regulatory, and industry standards to ensure that security practices align with best practices and mitigate legal risks:

GDPR Compliance: As a company handling personal data, Green Orbit Digital will ensure full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect individuals’ privacy rights.

ISO 27001: The organisation will align its information security management system (ISMS) with ISO 27001 standards to establish a globally recognised framework for managing security risks.

NIST Cybersecurity Framework: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework will be adopted to guide the development, implementation, and improvement of Green Orbit Digital’s security controls.

1. Training and Awareness

A key element of any successful security strategy is ensuring that employees understand their roles in safeguarding the organisation’s assets. Green Orbit Digital will implement a robust training programme that includes:

Security Onboarding: New hires will receive security training as part of their onboarding process, covering company policies, safe handling of information, and basic cybersecurity hygiene.

Ongoing Awareness Training: Regular security awareness sessions will be conducted to address emerging threats such as phishing, social engineering, and insider threats. Employees will be encouraged to report suspicious activity.

Role-Specific Training: Employees in security-sensitive roles (e.g., system administrators, developers, and managers) will receive additional training to ensure they are equipped to manage specific security risks relevant to their responsibilities.

1. Third-Party Security

Green Orbit Digital will ensure that third-party vendors and partners adhere to the same high security standards. This includes:

Vendor Risk Management: Security assessments of third-party vendors will be conducted as part of the vendor onboarding process. Contracts will include security requirements, such as data protection clauses and breach notification procedures.

Third-Party Security Audits: Third-party service providers will undergo regular security audits to ensure compliance with our security policies and standards.

1. Performance Metrics and Continuous Improvement

To measure the effectiveness of our security strategy, Green Orbit Digital will track performance against key metrics, including:

Incident Response Time: The average time taken to detect, respond to, and resolve security incidents.

Number of Vulnerabilities Remediated: The percentage of identified vulnerabilities that are addressed within a defined timeframe.

Employee Security Training Completion Rate: The percentage of employees who complete mandatory security training.

This data will be reviewed regularly, and the strategy will be updated to address new risks, improve processes, and ensure the highest level of security is maintained.

1. Conclusion

Green Orbit Digital’s security strategy is designed to protect the organisation’s assets, systems, and data against evolving threats while enabling business continuity and compliance. By adopting industry best practices, applying robust security controls, and fostering a culture of security awareness, we will create a secure digital environment that supports the organisation’s growth and innovation while safeguarding the interests of our clients, employees, and stakeholders.

This strategy will be reviewed periodically and adjusted in response to changing technology, emerging threats, and evolving business needs.
