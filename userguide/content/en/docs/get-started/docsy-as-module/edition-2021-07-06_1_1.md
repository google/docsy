![Susannah-Reed-TMS-Thumb](/handbook/sales/field-communications/field-flash-newsletter/images/Susannah-Reed-TMS-Thumb.png)

**Where did you grow up, and where are you based now?**

I grew up in Houston, TX where I worked at my family’s restaurant Bubba’s Texas Burger Shack. I’ve now lived in Gaithersburg, MD for the last 15 years.

**What is your favorite thing about your job?**

I love how much GitLab’s CREDIT values are embedded into everything we do. Even my customers know them and recognize how much it differentiates us.

**Which of GitLab's Values resonates most with you?**

Collaboration. I have always been amazed by how kind and helpful all GitLab team members are and how much that contributes to all of our success.

**Do you have a helpful tip for working at GitLab and/or in the Field org to share?**

We have a weekly touch point for my territory where we always review upcoming meetings, follow-up items, overall account strategy and marketing, and how the channel can help. The extended team can collaborate live or async, but it helps keep us focused and organized both tactically and strategically. (See more of Susannah’s selling tips in [her video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBJdYGLofHE).)

**What is a hobby or skill you have that the team might not know about?**

I was a Scottish Highland dancer and can still do a highland fling and sword dance.

**What’s the most random thing in your purse/wallet?**

A [Funchop chopstick helper](https://www.funchop.com/) for my daughter.
