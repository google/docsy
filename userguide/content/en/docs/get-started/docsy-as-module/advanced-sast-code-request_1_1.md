For requests concerning the source code of LGPL-licensed components in GitLab Advanced SAST, you will utilize the `Advanced SAST App` within the Zendesk instance. It will automate the process and guide you through it until a legal issue is created.

Once a legal issue is created, Dev Pulse is activated on the ticket (treating it as a RFH). The ticket will remain on-hold until the legal issue is updated, at which point you will be instructed what to say/do by our legal team.

Should the issue require some back and forth, you would simply "re-Dev Pulse" the ticket using the macro `General::Waiting on RFH`.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions as you work on the ticket, please CC Jason Colyer on the ticket (and add an internal note about the issue/question).
