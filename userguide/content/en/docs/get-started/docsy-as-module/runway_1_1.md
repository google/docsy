## What is Runway?

Runway is GitLab's internal Platform as a Service implementation, which aims to enable teams to deploy and run their services quickly and safely. Having built-in capabilities for monitoring and scaling means that Development teams can focus on delivering and enhancing their features.

Runway is maintained by the [Scalability:Practices](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/scalability/practices/) team.

## Initial Goals

- Enable Development team to deploy their service using the built-in capabilities for infrastructure, scaling, monitoring that Runway provides.
- Focused on satellite services that are stateless and thus can be autoscaled to meet demand.
- Integration with GitLab's existing tooling (e.g. Pipeline) to enable a streamlined experience.
