title: Legacy Level Up - Thought Industries

## (LEGACY) Level Up

This handbook page is meant to support both learners and administrators in Level Up. Thought Industries is the provider of the Level Up platform and is mentioned often in this documentation. We're currently going through the implementation of a new version of LevelUp, using a new system - Cornerstone. We've moved this page to be titled Legacy to avoid confusion between the two systems whilst the transiton is taking place. We expect the implementation to be complete sometime in Q2 FY2026. More infromation can be found on the main [LevelUp](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/level-up/) handbook page.

## Contribute to Level Up

At GitLab, [everyone can contribute](/handbook/company/mission/#mission). Read below about how to contribute to Level Up. If you'd like to explore the content creation options in Level Up, check out this [Demo Course](https://levelup.gitlab.com/access/saml/login/internal-team-members?returnTo=https://levelup.gitlab.com/learn/course/demo-course).

### Why contribute?

Contributing to Level Up democratizes learning and enables our team members, customers, and community members to contribute to the growth of learning opportunities at GitLab. Some benefits for contributors include:

1. Share the work you've created to teach others how to use GitLab
1. Curate existing information that has helped you or others learn to use GitLab
1. Share information you've created about working remotely
1. Establish yourself as a subject matter expert within our learning community
1. Share learning pathways and other instructional design materials you've created
1. Enable organizations to learn about GitLab using innovative learning methods

**Stay Tuned:** Future iterations of contributions to Level Up will include elevated permissions for Learning evangelists to add new material directly to Level Up!

### Learning Evangelist Training

To contribute to Level Up, there are two things to do.

First, please open an issue in the [lxp-contributions project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/lxp-contributions) using the `lxp_contribution` issue template and tag `Jamie Allen`. We will review your training request and advise on next steps. The Learning and Development team can assist in the creation of content, or if you'd prefer, you can go through the Learning Evangelist Training so that you can create it yourself.

If you want to build the content into the platform yourself, please complete the Level Up [Learning Evangelist training](https://levelup.gitlab.com/access/saml/login/internal-team-members?returnTo=https://levelup.gitlab.com/learn/course/learning-evangelist-training). This training course uses instructional videos to teach learners the basics of content creation in Level Up, and includes some best practice to think about when designing learning content and gathering materials. Once you have completed the training, the Learning and Development team will uplift your permissions in Level Up to give you access to course authoring tools.

You can also use the [Learning Evangelist handbook page](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/level-up/course-author-training/) to review any of the content in the course, directly from the handbook.
