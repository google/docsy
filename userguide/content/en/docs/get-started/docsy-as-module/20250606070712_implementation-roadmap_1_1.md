<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## üìç Phase 1: Initiation & Commitment

### 1.1 Obtain Leadership Commitment

- Appoint Top Management as Policy Owner (e.g. Director/CEO)

- Communicate commitment across the organisation

- Embed energy into Green Orbit Digital‚Äôs wider ESG/CSR and sustainability strategy

### 1.2 Define Scope and Boundaries

- Establish organisational boundaries (e.g. offices, digital assets, travel, servers)

- Define scope of the EnMS (e.g. all energy-consuming operations within Green Orbit‚Äôs control)

### 1.3 Appoint Energy Management Team

- Assign Energy Management Lead

- Define roles and responsibilities using a RACI matrix

- Integrate cross-functional representatives (e.g. comms, finance, digital ops)

### 1.4 Conduct a Gap Analysis

- Assess current practices vs ISO 50001 requirements

- Identify compliance gaps, risks, and opportunities for improvement

- Map alignment with existing certifications (ISO 14001, 9001, 20121)

## üìä Phase 2: Planning & Energy Review

### 2.1 Conduct Energy Review

- Collect historical and real-time energy consumption data (use TRACE, Compare Your Footprint)

- Identify Significant Energy Uses (SEUs)

- Establish an Energy Baseline

- Identify variables affecting energy performance (e.g. seasonal, occupancy, campaign loads)

### 2.2 Define Objectives, Targets & Action Plans

- Align with Green Orbit Digital‚Äôs net-zero goals, CSR framework, and SBTi

- Set SMART energy objectives (e.g. reduce office energy use by 15% by 2026)

- Develop Energy Action Plans with performance indicators and timelines

### 2.3 Develop Energy Performance Indicators (EnPIs)

- Example EnPIs: Energy use per campaign, server load per visitor, kWh per employee

- Use dashboards in Notion or integrate with external tools

## üìú Phase 3: System Design & Documentation

### 3.1 Establish the Energy Management System (EnMS)

- Develop procedures for monitoring, measuring, and managing energy

- Link EnMS to your broader Integrated Management System (IMS)

### 3.2 Document Key Policies and Procedures

- Finalise and distribute the updated Energy Policy

- Create EnMS Manual and standard operating procedures (SOPs)

- Include internal audit procedures, management review protocols, corrective actions

### 3.3 Integrate with Procurement and Design

- Embed energy efficiency into procurement policies and supplier requirements

- Evaluate lifecycle energy use when selecting digital tools and infrastructure

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 4: Implementation

### 4.1 Resource Allocation & Training

- Ensure availability of tools, data systems, and analytical capabilities

- Provide training to all staff (energy awareness, SOPs, EnMS roles)

### 4.2 Deploy Monitoring & Measurement Systems

- Install or enhance systems for tracking energy use (smart meters, digital analytics)

- Create internal reporting dashboards in Notion or your sustainability toolkit

- Align with ISO/IEC 27000:2018 for data protection

### 4.3 Launch Energy Efficiency Projects

- Implement action plans: LED retrofits, optimised campaign delivery, digital asset performance audits

- Promote energy-saving behaviour in day-to-day operations

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## üîç Phase 5: Evaluation & Internal Audit

### 5.1 Conduct Internal Audits

- Develop and follow a formal audit schedule

- Audit against ISO 50001 clauses and your documented procedures

- Train internal auditors or bring in a qualified external partner

### 5.2 Perform Management Reviews

- Hold regular review meetings to assess:

## üèÖ Phase 6: Certification

### 6.1 Select Accredited Certification Body

- Choose a UKAS-accredited certification body experienced in SME sustainability

### 6.2 Prepare for Stage 1 Audit

- Submit documentation (Energy Policy, EnMS Manual, baseline data, etc.)

- Demonstrate readiness and implementation progress

### 6.3 Undergo Stage 2 Audit

- Provide evidence of EnMS effectiveness in practice

- Respond to auditor queries and non-conformities (if any)

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## üîÅ Phase 7: Continuous Improvement

### 7.1 Act on Audit Feedback

- Address non-conformities with documented corrective actions

- Update procedures and policies as required

### 7.2 Maintain & Enhance the EnMS

- Integrate with quarterly carbon reporting

- Link outcomes with the Carbon Reduction Fund, B Corp progress, and SBTi

- Continually improve energy performance through innovation (e.g. AI for analytics, digital sustainability insights)

### 7.3 Annual Reviews & Re-certification

- Conduct annual reviews of energy performance, targets, and policies

- Schedule 3-year re-certification audit and interim surveillance audits as needed
