title: "Transparency by Default"
---

## Purpose

In alignment with our company value of Transparency, one focus of the security organization is to lead the most transparent security organization in business today. Transparency by default requires us to challenge the status quo where security teams traditionally operate in a very private and closed-off manner. However, being open by default requires us to be even more diligent in our efforts of categorizing data in order to ensure the protection of our customers, company, and team member data. Therefore, our position is that all information and activities produced by the security team should be considered "Public by Default" unless defined below:
