### Purpose

The Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging (DIB) Team has a variety of ways that it communicates with team members from IC all the way up to e-group, this page documents the ways we do this, what information will be provided and the timing of when these communications will happen.

### Encouraging Participation in Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging

DIB is a core value and is something that is measured by [DIB Compentencies](/handbook/values/#diversity-inclusion--belonging-competency) in performance reviews, mid reviews and promotions. The DIB team is providing an easily accessible way for team members to display the DIB value by providing on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on level, way you can contribute on a increasing scale of Good, Better & Best. This will enable team members to participate in a ways they are able to at any given time depending on competing priorities.
