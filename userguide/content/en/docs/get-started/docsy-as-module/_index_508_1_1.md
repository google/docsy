## Proof of Value (POV)

Proof of value is a combination of [technical evaluation](/handbook/solutions-architects/processes/_index.md) and the communication of the expected business value of a solution.  The solution, its practical application, and how it drives specific business value are proven and documented through the POV process.

Solution Architects are instrumental in guiding prospects and customers to carry out a successful Proof of **Value**. POV's should focus on specific prospect/customer business outcomes that cannot be achieved through other consultative interactions.

Any GitLab product evaluation should remain separate from GitLab high availability architecture and implementations.

A POV is conducted with a GitLab trial license either using GitLab.com or a self-managed instance. Due to cost, time, and the associated opportunity risk, a POV should not be the default course of action for GitLab prospects/customers.

### POV Guidelines and Requirements

- The typical duration for a POV is between 1 and 8 weeks which depends on complexity and style of engagement.
- A GitLab Customer Success [collaboration project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management/templates/poc-plan) developed from the POV plan is the default method for POV management.  The project template is only accessible by GitLab team members, but once a collaboration project is created, the customer will be granted access to that project.  When utilizing a collaboration project, follow the instructions in README.md closely to configure the entire project properly.  The [POV template project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management/templates/poc-plan) also contains a [wiki page with a POV Plan template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management/templates/poc-plan/-/wikis/customer/pov-template) that can be used to document the scope, critieria, activities and progress of a POV.
- GitLab Solutions Architects should limit the number of concurrent POV's the SA is engaged in to provide the optimal focus for successful opportunity outcomes.  In collaboration with the sales team and their manager, the SA should prioritize all SA activity, including POVs, based on workload, opportunity qualification, and regional or segment strategy.
- A POV must be fully qualified before commencement
- A POV must be tracked in Salesforce
- A POV should not be used to implement a scaled architecture for the customer's unique infrastructure
- A POV is not a full or production quality implementation of the solution
- A POV is not a self run, technical trial to test out a feature for the existing license (can be covered in the CSM cadence for expansion on adoption)
- A POV is not an individual team member on the customer side performing self-learning and certification (can promote PS education services)
- A POV is not a self-paced exploration of GitLab (this can is covered in the CSM cadence)
- A POV is not an informal review of GitLab by a new logo prospect

### POV Qualification

- Must tie to an opportunity for a new logo or up-tier to ultimate for an existing customer with a net ARR over 100K or with significant LAM

- It is guided by GitLab SA to run the scoped hands-on technical evaluation with the prospect/customer, collaborate with the sales (SAE, AE) with defined business outcomes and GitLab values

- Prospect/customer has identified and provided available technical and business resources to perform the evaluation, discuss / assess the results to map to the outcomes and value

- Top business drivers are identified with POV scope, success criteria of the POV are defined to execute the POV and subsequently drive next step in the deal process

- Must identify the champion and economic buyers and they must be in agreement (e.g., "sign-off") on the success criteria; faciliate the executive connection and sponsorship

- A Command Plan is populated in Salesforce for the opportunity with the following fields:
    Why Now
    Why do anything at all
    Metrics
    Decision Process - stakeholders
    Pain
    Access to economic buyer
    Impact of not solving that(Compelling event with business needs)

- Top customer business values mapped to one of the GitLab solutions: DevSecOps, Software Compliance, Automated Software Delivery, and cumulatively DevOps Platform.

### POV Scope and Acceptance

SA working with SAE and AE can define the POV scope with the customer, with alignment to the business values and the GitLab solution. For each solution, the typical scope and acceptances are listed for reference but the team should define the scope, time and execution with acceptance for each engagement.

- [DevSecOps](/handbook/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/pov/devsecops/)
- [Software Compliance](/handbook/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/pov/compliance/)
- [Automated Software Delivery](/handbook/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/pov/automation/)
- [Artificial Intelligence](/handbook/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/pov/ai/)
- and cumulatively, The DevOps [Platform](/handbook/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/pov/platform/)

### Tracking a POV in Salesforce

#### Salesforce Object

A POV, no matter the type, should be validated by the Solutions Architect.  Therefore, the `SA Validated Tech Evaluation Start Date` field on the Opportunity needs to be filled with the date the POV would start.  Likewise, the `SA Validated Tech Evalulation End Date` field should be entered when it completes.

In order to track a POV correctly in Salesforce, the Strategic Account Executive should position the opportunity as Stage 3. The Solutions Architect will create the POV object within SFDC when the prospect or customer has indicated interest in moving forward with a POV.

To track a POV, click the _Proof of Values_ tab from the top menu bar in Salesforce. Create a new POV using the _New_ button. Alternately, the Solutions Architect may select the relevant Opportunity, scroll down to the related list labeled _Proof of Values_ and click on the "New Proof of Value" button. This will automatically associate the POV with that Opportunity while all other fields need to be manually completed.

Complete the following fields at minimum:

- **POV Owner** - this is the Strategic Account Executive
- **Customer Success Manager** - this is the CSM who will be introduced during the POV
- **Solutions Architect** - this is the SA who owns execution of the POV
- **Proof of Value Name** - this commonly is named identical to the opportunity name
- **Account** - this is the company name
- **Opportunity** - this is the associated opportunity name (this opportunity should be in stage 3)
- **POV Start Date** - the date the POV is expected to begin
- **POV Close Date** - the date the POV is expected to End
- **POV Type** - this is style POV being executed (deprecated)

Once the POV begins, the Solutions Architect should change the **Status** field from _New_ to _In Progress_. When the POV is complete, the Solutions Architect should change the **Status** to _Closed_ and the **Result** should be identified as _Successful_ or _Unsuccessful_. Freeform notes should be added to support the reason for the successful or unsuccessful result.

#### Sales and Solutions Architecture Leader Approval Process

When an opportunity is [well-qualified for a Proof of Value](#pov-qualification), Enterprise opportunity win rate is over 90% versus around 30% for other technical evaluations (e.g., tech eval, trials, proof of concept).

The field currently records a considerable volume of technical evaluations as Proof of Values.  Recording nonqualified activity as a POV makes it challenging to track where we can up-level our strategy in an opportunity for a qualified Proof of Value or Value Stream Assessment.

Without the ability to efficiently report on the technical win activity and proof of value work, it's difficult for Sales and SA leadership to identify coaching opportunities and better predict outcomes.

An approval workflow is rolling out to allow Sales and SA leaders to regularly review our activity while marking well-qualified technical win activity as Proof of Values.

Please work closely with your SA or Sales leader counterpart to regularly review opportunities with a Proof of Value object while marking well-qualified POVs with approval.

Sales and SA leader participation in the POV approval process will ensure we can quickly and regularly identify opportunities for coaching and predictability.

##### Approval Process

- Upon mutual agreement with the associated SAE, the Solution Architect working on the opportunity will [create a POV object on the opportunity](#tracking-a-pov-in-salesforce).
- When a new POV object is created, a notification is posted to the `#troops-pov-created` slack channel.
- In addition to a weekly review of a region's ongoing POVs and technical win work, Area sales and SA leaders monitor the `#troops-pov-created` slack channel for new POVs.  When a new POV is created, asynchronous or synchronous collaboration on the quality of the opportunity commences.
- The ASM or SA Manager marks the POV for approval via the Salesforce object or through a troops action in Slack.
- The ASM or SA Manager will query about plans to position professional services at this stage. All SAEs/SAs are required to position Professional services in opportunities with a qualified POV to guarantee continued success for the customer. Please read more about how to positon [here](/handbook/solutions-architects/processes/#positioning-professional-services)

### POV Best Practices

Solutions Architects are the owners of the POV, guiding prospects through a successful experience with GitLab. As such, Solutions Architects should be the primary contacts for questions and issues experienced by the prospect during the POV. If support is required for an unforseen technical issue, some POVs may qualify as [priority prospects](/handbook/support/priority_prospects/#overview) and may contact the support team.

Many prospects are tempted to include implementation of GitLab high availability as part of a POV. In this case, the implementation components should comprise a separate POV entirely, separating GitLab functionality evaluations from implementation, load and performance components.

Other best practices for POV's:

- SA's must be part of proposing or committing to POV's
- POV's should be a late-stage component that triggers the sale, not an early offering
- Ask WHY a POV is required vs Q&A or other considerations, since prospects are often using existing GitLab installations
- Feature/function POV's should be run in basic environments, not HA, unless the HA environment is already established and proven
- Required capabilities should be a limited number, 5 or less ideally - these should be purchase triggers and differentiators
- Please work together(SA & SAE) to map required capabilities to decision criteria in the COM plan
- A POV does not implement a fully designed and configured ecosystem in a customer environment, it is a product evaluation

Below is best practice guidance for conducting each type of POV. These processes share a similar goal of meeting identified business outcomes for the customer, but they vary based on engagement style, POV duration, location and intensity. The following applies to all POV's:

### POV Key Players

#### Customer Roles

- Executive contact - A leader with business level, budgetary buy in
- At least one pilot team to execute the POV
- Technical POV lead

#### GitLab Roles

- Strategic Account Executive (SAE) or Account Executive (AE) - Relationship manager, owner of licensing
- Solutions Architect (SA) - Primary technical contact, POV owner and project manager
- Customer Success Manager (CSM) - _Only for qualified accounts._ Introduced for customer visibility, occasional POV assistance
- Professional Services - rarely as needed in a pre-sales capacity
- Support Team - only if needed for technical errors, engaged via the customer per the [Internal Support page](/handbook/support/internal-support/#note-on-zendesk-and-supportgitlabcom)

## POV Kickoff Checklist

- SA: Ensure the customer architecture is prepared to support the POV (if self-managed)
- SA: Ensure customer network has access to GitLab.com (if SaaS evaluation)
- SA: Customer Success project is created in GitLab as per the [CSM Handbook page](/handbook/customer-success/csm/#to-start-a-new-customer-engagement)
- SA: POV document is created if this is required by the customer, otherwise default to the Customer Success project
- SA: Ensure POV goals and business outcomes are clearly identified prior to kickoff
- SA: For the largest strategic opportunities, notify GitLab Support of POV dates, customer, and other relevant information using the applicable Slack channel related to Self-Managed or GitLab.com support
- SAE/AE: Opportunity updated in Salesforce, set to Stage 3-Technical Evaluation, with POV Information entered per the [handbook](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/)
- SAE/AE: Signed NDA by the legal team if required
- SAE/AE: Review [Customer Assurance Package](https://trust.gitlab.com/) with customer (if SaaS evaluation)
  - The Customer Package requires an NDA, and contains commonly requested security information (SOC2, Penetration Test Results, etc) and can be requested via a [Field Security Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/field-security-team/customer-assurance-activities/caa-servicedesk/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Security%20Documents%20CAA)
- SAE/AE: Schedule Internal kick off meeting (detailed below)
- SAE/AE: Schedule kickoff meeting with customer
- CSM: Review collaboration project content prior to internal kickoff meeting
- SA: For SaaS trials that need CI/CD, request trial runner activation per the [handbook](/handbook/support/internal-support/#trial-extensions-and-plans).

## POV Meeting Recordings

POV-related calls may be recorded with customer consent. Recordings may be stored in Chorus, in a folder on Google Drive (if recorded locally), or within the project repository (if small). Any recording links should be identified in the notes stored within the Documents directory of the project repository.

## POV Types

There are multiple options when executing a POV. The POV type chosen should reflect the wishes and best fit for the customer. POV types, in order of usage frequency, include:

- **Guided** - This is the most common POV for Enterprise customers, comprising the majority of all customer experiences, typically lasting between 14 and 45 days, though it may be extended in some circumstances up to 60 days.
- **Lite** - This type of POV is used exclusively for Commercial opportunities requiring minimal touch points throughout the POV. This is not to be used for Enterprise "guided trials."
- **On-site** - This less common type is an intense, condensed POV typically executed on the client premises within a tight evaluation window (typically 1 week).
- **Paid** - Rarely, a prospect pays GitLab for a long duration evaluation of the software (typically exceeding 60 days).

Best practices specific to each type of POV follows.

### Guided POV

The Guided POV is the most commonly utilized type of POV for Enterprise accounts. These will commonly have a 30 to 60 day duration.

#### Guided POV Template Document

For a  guided POV, the SA must utilize parts or entire  [Guided POV document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N6gFggzxqueyywF8CxepfjCi-2AIed9PVyy8VcpfIJk/edit#heading=h.30j0zll)  which validates POV dates, success criteria and assumptions of both GitLab and the prospect. The 4 fields below are mandatory for strategic POVs:

- Desired future
- Desired business outcomes
- Required Capabilities (Success Criterias) aligned to decision criteria & value drivers in SFDC
- Metrics

These POV's are marked by regular touch points and consistent interaction over time without requiring full time dedication to the GitLab evaluation on behalf of the customer. It is common to have kickoff meetings, technical support calls, weekly retrospective calls and POV conclusion calls when running a Guided POV. These meetings may be represented by the following suggestions:

#### Internal Kickoff Meeting led by the Solutions Architect

GitLab Attendees: Strategic Account Executive, Solutions Architect

Agenda:

- Collaboratively review customer success project README to ensure everything is correct
- POV document review (only if a document is required for the POV)
- Discussion of strategy, whether GitLab Support or Professional Services need to be notified
- Strategic Account Executive to schedule external kickoff with customer

#### External Kickoff Meeting (Remote) led by the Solutions Architect

Attendees:

- GitLab: Strategic Account Executive, Solutions Architect
- Customer: Executive contact, Technical POV lead

Agenda:

- Screen share with the customer to discuss the below agenda items
- Collaboratively review customer success project README to ensure everything is correct
- Agree on due dates for POV completion, add to project POV milestone
- Review project POV issues - add new issues if necessary with agreed due dates
- Review POV document with customer (only when required)
- Establish cadence with customer, Strategic Account Executive to schedule during this call
- Create issues for each cadence call with customer under the POV milestone for call notes
- Provision licenses and establish if customer needs help getting GitLab set up and configured

#### Weekly Retrospective call led by the Solutions Architect

Attendees:

- GitLab: Solutions Architect, Strategic Account Executive
- Customer: Technical POV Lead

Agenda:

- What went well?
- What problems do we need to overcome?
- What do we need to change?
- Review success criteria - are we on track?

#### POV Conclusion Meeting led by the SAE or AE

Attendees:

- GitLab: Strategic Account Executive, Solutions Architect, Customer Success Manager
- Customer: Executive contact, Technical POV Lead

Agenda:

- Did we satisfy the required capabilities?
- Did we meet the value driver for the customer? Is this a technical win?
- Identify next steps
- Send out POV survey (where applicable)

### On-site or Hands-On POV

The On-site or Hands-On(virtual) POV is typically the shortest and most intense POV. It is critical that before this type of POV begins:

- All outcomes and objectives are agreed to and documented
- GitLab and customer team members are identified
- Calendar schedules are arranged preferably with meetings(like standup) every day
- System installations and/or user administration tasks are complete

The SA will typically join the client at their chosen location(or virtually) and work directly with the team there to quickly identify the value proposition of GitLab within their environment. The SA will commonly dedicate themselves to the client for a fixed few hours every day(or agreed upon cadence) of the week for this POV.

The objective of the daily(regularly cadenced) meetings will be:

- Checking on the POV status
- Identifying blockers & coming up with a plan to remove them swiftly(in an agreed timeline)
- Collaborating on value drivers
- Assisting in solving problems
- Enabling customer POV owners on required knowledge to obtain identified POV outcomes

### Paid POV

The Paid POV is less common than other types of POV's. These will commonly have duration greater than 60 days, and the customer will pay for usage of GitLab for the duration of the POV. Before this type of POV can begin, it requires a GitLab prorated licensing purchase to be completed. These POV's are marked by regular touch points and consistent interaction over time without requiring full time dedication to the GitLab evaluation on behalf of the customer. This type of POV will commonly have a larger ecosystem focus, where the value of GitLab is dependent on interactions with other tools and environments within the client's ecosystem. It is common to have kickoff meetings, technical support calls, cadenced retrospective calls and POV conclusion calls similar to those identified for a Guided POV.

### Lite POV - Exclusive to Commercial (DEPRECATED)

When a prospect has an internal POV process to follow, or when time is of the essence, a Lite POV is utilized.

#### Lite POV Template Document

For a Lite POV, the SA may utilize the [Lite POV document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PO3jXG3wiKsCbx5vb8dm4SmOe_PiTB47SadROIO8nCc/edit#) (only accessible to GitLab team-members), which validates POV dates, success criteria and assumptions of both GitLab and the prospect.

In the case of a Lite POV, the Solutions Architect is expected to be the sole GitLab contact. "Lite" is determined case-by-case by the size of the prospect as well as their ability to engage with GitLab.

#### Using the LITE POV Template

To use the Lite POV template, begin by making a copy of the master document for each POV.

Edit each area highlighted in yellow within the document to include pertinent information for any particular prospect. This information includes basic data like the prospect name and GitLab team-member details, as well as data to be collaboratively identified with the prospect, such as primary objective, required capabilities and the environment information. Delete any red-colored instructional text.

Finally, ensure both GitLab and the prospect have a copy of the document. Schedule weekly meetings for the duration of the POV via calendar invites prior to distributing the GitLab Enterprise Edition license for the POV.

## Commercial Sales POV Guide

Commercial Sales POV's are commonly executed as a variety of the Lite POV, though they may not utilize the [Lite POV document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PO3jXG3wiKsCbx5vb8dm4SmOe_PiTB47SadROIO8nCc/edit#). Typical customer interactions for Commercial POV's are identified below.

### Kick Off Meeting

- Duration: 30 Minutes
- Attendees: GitLab Account Executive, GitLab Solutions Architect, Prospective Customer
- Agenda:
  - Define success criteria (as a best practice, have no more than 5 required capabilities)
  - Confirm start and end date
  - Determine primary communication method
    - Customer to decide if they are interested in communicating on a collaborative GitLab project or email only
    - Collaborative, time-limited Slack channels are an option depending on SA capacity and opportunity IACV
    - Frequency options: 30 minute weekly call or email touchbase weekly with calls scheduled as needed
- SA role:
  - Acts as the primary point of contact throughout POV process
  - Tracks status updates regarding success criteria
  - Records any existing or new feature requests of interest to customer
  - Leads troubleshooting and escalation of blockers

### Commercial Sales - POV and Customer Success Plan Creation

- Create and track the POV in Salesforce according to [this process](/handbook/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/pov/#tracking-a-pov-in-salesforce)
- Create a new [customer project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management/commercial/pre-sales) in the Commercial/Pre-sales group. To use the template, select the 'Create from Template' tab, select the 'Group' templates, and then click 'Use template' for the 'New Customer Project - Commercial Sales' template.
- Edit README.md with information specific to POV under the Proof of Value section and fill in any additional relevant fields.
- Upon completion of POV, update Salesforce record with POV result as successful or unsuccessful and provide supportive reasons in the associated freeform fields
  - For a successful POV:
    - SA adds any other known information in README.md, then moves the project from the Pre-sales group to [Commercial](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management/commercial)
    - CSM and AE determine CSM eligibility and engagement based on Account Tier and IACV.
    - CSM, SA and AE schedule meeting with new customer to establish a starting baseline, review the project data and establish intended collaborative usage moving forward.

## POV Template Document

As an alternative (or in addition) to using a collaboration GitLab project, a document is available which helps outline the details of a POV. The POV [template document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N6gFggzxqueyywF8CxepfjCi-2AIed9PVyy8VcpfIJk/edit?usp=sharing) (only accessible to GitLab team members) provides the framework for a successful POV by addressing the primary business value driver, the current situation, the desired objective, the required capabilities, metrics and environment information.

This document suggests and verifies specific success criteria for any POV, as well as outlining a mutual commitment between GitLab and the identified prospect parties. It also specifies the limited timeframe in which the POV will occur.

### Using the POV Template Document

To use the full POV template, begin by making a copy of the [template document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N6gFggzxqueyywF8CxepfjCi-2AIed9PVyy8VcpfIJk/edit?usp=sharing) (only accessible to GitLab team members) for each POV.

Edit each area highlighted in yellow within the document to include pertinent information for any particular prospect. This information includes basic data like the prospect name and GitLab team-member details, as well as data to be collaboratively identified with the prospect, such as primary objective, required capabilities and the environment information. Delete any red-colored instructional text.

Finally, ensure both GitLab and the prospect have a copy of the document. Schedule weekly meetings for the duration of the POV via calendar invites prior to distributing the GitLab Enterprise Edition license for the POV.

## POV Template Wiki Page

As an alternative to using a Google document for a POV plan, a wiki page is available in the collaboration project to capture the details of a POV.  This wiki page is similar to the POV teplate document except in a GitLab Wiki page.
The advantages of using a wiki page are:

- Accesible to customers that may block access to Google docs
- Provides a rich-text document format suitable for sharing with executives after the completion of the POV during the negotiation phase which issues do not
- Provides an ability to have multiple POVs within a single customer project
- Gets the prospective customer thinking about using GitLab for everything

### Using the POV Template Wiki Page

For new customers wothout a collaboration project, the POV Plan template will be included in the Wiki when the collaboration project is created from the [POV project template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management/templates/poc-plan).
For existing customers there are two options for getting the POV template into the existing customer collaboration project:

1. Open the POV collaboration project wiki page and copy the text and paste it into a new page in the customer collaboration project wiki and uopdate it with the specific customer details
1. Clone the POV template wiki locally, update it and push to the customer collaboration project following the steps below (assuming the customer name is MyCustomer):
   1. Access the wiki (Plan -> Wiki) page in the POV project template
   1. In the upper right corner click `Clone repository`, copy the clone URL and from a terminal on the local machine run `git clone <clone_url>`
   1. `cd poc-plan.wiki`
   1. Rename customer.md to MyCustomer.md (obviously substitute the real customer name for MyCustomer)
      `git mv home/customer.md home/MyCustomer.md`
   1. Rename the customer directory to MyCustomer
      `git mv customer MyCustomer`
   1. Rename the `pov-template.md` file to whatever the pov should be named
      `git mv MyCustomer/pov-template.md MyCustomer/devsecops-pov.md`
   1. Edit `home.md` to change link to MyCustomer directory
   1. Edit `MyCustomer.md` to update references
   1. Edit `devsecops-pov.md` to find and replace all references to CustomerName with MyCustomer and any other edits the want to make
   1. Stage the changes in git
      `git add .`
   1. Commit the changes to the local report
      `git commit`
   1. Point the git origin at the new customer success collaboration project
      `git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.com:gitlab-com/account-management/western-north-america/MyCompany/MyCompany.wiki.git`
   1. Push the changes to the new customer success collaboration project
      `git push origin`
1. View the new wiki in the new customer success collaboration project to ensure it is there and continue making any other edits in the wiki web editor (or on the local machine).

## POV Resources

Below is an evolving list of projects that have proven beneficial during POVs, which may be a great starting point to offer customers.

### End-to-End Proof Projects

These projects have a very simple set of code that provides the ability to demonstrate the `happy-path` for a POV.  While these are more in the Hello World category of projects, they tend to have simple mechanizations to exercise different parts of GitLab.  SAs have used these in the past as a way to assess the installation of self-managed environments.

- [Insecure Tanuki Tech Project](https://gitlab-core.us.gitlabdemo.cloud/demosys-users/skamani/insecure-tanuki) was developed internally to show the usage of Auto DevOps. It is predominantly focused on Secure features, but serves well to present all stages.

### Demonstrative of Specific Stages

These projects are demonstrative of specific stages.  They are generally built on existing code OSS bases which the customer may be familiar with, are easy to understand, and have good literature to refer to.

#### Secure Stage Projects

- [Nodejs Juice Shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) repository comes with a .gitlab-ci.yml file to get started with SAST and Dependency Scanning.  Incorporate others incrementally as needed.
- [OWASP WebGoat.NET](https://gitlab-core.us.gitlabdemo.cloud/tanuki-group/dot-net-webgoat) repository can be enabled with SAST, License Management and Secrets Scanning very quickly using the packaged templates.  This validates our positioning in .NET application development (both Framework and Core).

#### Proof of Value Enalement
