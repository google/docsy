## Why promote sustainability in space?

As a pioneering agency focused on sustainable marketing for the space industry, we understand why it's crucial to communicate your company's sustainability story. Today's space industry stakeholders and consumers expect organizations to demonstrate their commitment to environmental responsibility both on Earth and beyond:

- Space organizations need to visibly demonstrate their commitment to environmental responsibility across all operations

- Growing demand for green space initiatives requires effective communication of sustainability credentials

- Younger generations particularly expect space companies to show clear commitment to sustainable practices

- Globally, 75% of respondents in a 2023 PWC survey said they’re willing to pay more for sustainably produced goods.

- A 2021 report by Deloitte found that 55% of consumers said they had recently purchased a sustainable product or service, with 32% of them willing to pay more for sustainable alternatives. These consumers are more likely to return to brands that align with their values.

- According to a 2020 IBM and National Retail Federation (NRF) study, nearly 9 in 10 Gen Z consumers (87%) believe companies should help address environmental and social issues. This generation, along with millennials, shows higher brand loyalty when companies visibly commit to sustainability.

This data underscores that sustainability is no longer just a trend—it’s a crucial factor in building and maintaining consumer loyalty, especially among younger, environmentally-conscious generations.





## Building Trust Through Transparency

At Green Orbit Digital, we understand that building trust in sustainable marketing requires complete transparency in how we communicate environmental commitments. We help space organizations demonstrate their dedication to sustainability through:

- Clear, evidence-based messaging that avoids vague environmental claims

- Regular reporting on sustainability goals and achievements

- Third-party certifications and validations to verify environmental claims

Our approach combines technical expertise with a deep passion for sustainability, helping space organizations build powerful online presences while maintaining authenticity in their eco-conscious messaging.

## Craft a powerful story that fits your brand

Conveying a strong message starts with thinking about what makes an impactful story for your specific audience. We recommend taking a holistic view by focusing on the three pillars of sustainability: people (social), planet (environmental), and profit (economic). These can be highlighted in two different ways:

- Communicate your partnership with the Rainforest Alliance in a general way, highlighting the many benefits and positive impact on people and nature. Check out our messaging templates.

- Focus on the element(s) that resonate best with your brand values and target audience, for example, by highlighting specific social or environmental messaging. Check out these examples of how other brands have done this; once you’ve identified your unique angle, we can work together to create a compelling, relevant campaign or activation that speaks to your customer’s interests.

### Raising awareness among consumers

Some effective ways to show consumers that you are on a credible, transparent journey towards sustainability are:

- Feature the Rainforest Alliance Certified seal on your products and packaging, and on your promotional materials and advertisements. Check out our guide on how to get approval to use our seal.

- Run a Follow the Frog campaign on social media or in-stores, using our free, downloadable creative assets.

- Run a cause marketing campaign in support of the Rainforest Alliance.

### Engaging your employees

Not surprisingly, employees are some of the best brand ambassadors. The 2023 Edelman Trust Barometer found that 67% of respondents view societal impact as a key factor when considering a job. By actively engaging your team in your sustainability efforts, you help keep them committed and motivated. Some ideas:

- Talk about our work together in your company’s newsletter or presentations.

- Encourage employees to follow the Rainforest Alliance on LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Facebook.

- Educate your sales force. Use compelling training materials that inspire your sales team and help them effectively present your Rainforest Alliance Certified products to your clients.

- Organize an employee engagement session, such as a product giveaway or lunch presentation to teach your team what the Rainforest Alliance stands for and what the green frog means for people and nature.

- Designate an in-house sustainability marketing expert who will be responsible for understanding the benefits (and challenges) of becoming a more sustainable business. This person can serve as your Rainforest Alliance liaison and help facilitate your marketing plan.



## Key Statistics on Sustainability Impact

Recent data demonstrates the growing importance of sustainability in business and consumer decision-making:

- According to the 2023 Edelman Trust Barometer, 67% of respondents consider societal impact when choosing employment opportunities

- Studies show that companies with strong ESG practices achieve 18% higher ROI compared to those without such practices

- 77% of U.S. consumers are more likely to support brands committed to making positive global impact

These statistics underscore the business value of integrating sustainability into your marketing strategy:

- 59% of companies have transitioned to more sustainable materials and lower-emitting products in 2023
