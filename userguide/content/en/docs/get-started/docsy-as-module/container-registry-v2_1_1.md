### Milestone 16.3 (June 18, 2023 - July 17, 2023)

#### Goals

- Building instructions for manual install of the metadata database
- Planning discussions on how to breakdown the project into Experimental and Beta phases
- Milestone plan: [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/416110#container-registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/416110#container-registry)

#### Week of Aug 14-18

- Completed:
  - Updated the [architecture blueprint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/container_registry_metadata_database_self_managed_rollout/) with a new table structured for our feature based rollout approach: [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/128824](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/128824)
  - Completed the POC for installing the database using Helm and Omnibus for new installations.  Demo videos are posted in the [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/1065) for both installation paths.
