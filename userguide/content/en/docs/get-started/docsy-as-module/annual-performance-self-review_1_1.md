# Step 1: Identify the Year's Yay Moments

A whole year is hard to get through (especially this year). 

But look at you! You did it! ðŸŽ‰ 

You made progress this year, even if it doesn't always feel like it. 

Think of all the projects finished. The problems solved. The laughs and smiles made.

Don't leave them behind, forgotten, in this calendar year.

Name them. Celebrate them. Let them give you confidence you can handle what next year brings. ðŸ™Œ

### Add your year's yay momentsâ€”no matter how big or small they feelâ€”here:

- 

### Now, think: what can you do to lean into these existing wins further next year?

# Step 2: Recognize the Rough Spots

Like we established before, making it through the year isn't easy. It's a given not everything went as planned. 

And focusing on your wins doesn't mean you need to be in denial about your losses...no room for toxic positivity around here!

Recognizing any weak spots from the year can be freeing. 

Not only can it feel restraining to continue pretending everything's fine, but not examining your failures or mistakes means you'll never learn from them.

So real quick, we're going to acknowledge them, what lessons there might have been in them, and then move on. 

### What didn't go well this year?

- 

### What can you learn or take away from those experiences?

# Step 3: Grin About Your Growth

Between the wins and the losses, and the moments in between them both, you grew so much this year.

You grew every day.

Growth isn't always linear, and it isn't always vertical. Maybe one branch of your "life plant" didn't grow taller, but a new one sprouted and another had a new leaf bloom.

So now I want you to take things from the first two steps, and write down how you grew from them. That might be new skills learned, new habits built, and more.

# Step 4: Start to Look Forward

Once you've spent some time looking backwards, it's time to start looking forward again. This step is not the time for full-on, full-out annual planning (try the Work Brighter Practical Planning process for that), but it's getting that process started.

I want you to start thinking about the big picture you want to paint next year. 

### What goals do you want to reach?

- 

### What habits and routines do you want to have?

- 

### What kind of person do you want to be?

- 

### How do you want to spend your time?

- 

### What kind of work do you want to do?

- 

### Which relationships do you want to nurture?

- 

### This is all info that's helpful to think about before you actually dive into your yearly plan.

### What picture do I want to paint next year?
