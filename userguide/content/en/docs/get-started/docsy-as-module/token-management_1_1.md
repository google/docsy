## Direction

Out of due diligence and responsibility to GitLab users, the Token Management Working Group will
work towards building a foundation and path forward for future token management security
enhancements. This will be accomplished through the creation and publication of a token management
security policy and proposed fixes for the high risk and low effort token management issues. With
this, the Token Management Working Group will set up the fast follow on mid to long term token
management security enhancement effort for success. For additional detail please visit our
[Token Leaks internal handbook page](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/token-leaks/).
All the tokens will be stored in GitLab the application as we ship it to users and customers. By
dogfooding these enhancements and making improvements to meet our own security needs, we will
improve token management and protection of secrets for all users, becoming better stewards of our
user's secrets.

## Exit Criteria

The Token Management Working Group will deliver:

- Publish the first iteration of an official token and secrets management policy that is based on the [Token Standard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-research/cryptographic-standards/-/blob/main/token-standard.md) previously created
