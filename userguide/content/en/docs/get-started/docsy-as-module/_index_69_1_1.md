## Stack Overflow

[Stack Overflow for Teams](https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/gitlab-customer-success/questions) is a knowledge sharing and collaboration tool, available to the Solution Architecture (SA), Customer Success (CS), Professional Services (PS) and SMB sales teams.

The purpose is to:

1. To provide a knowledge sharing forum where SAs, CSMs, CSAs, SMB reps, PSEs and others can continue to evolve as learning organizations, where team members can have their questions answered on elements of the GitLab Platform in a timely fashion, and be retained beyond the limits currently in Slack today.
2. To provide an avenue to continue the onboarding and accelerate the growth of SA and CS teams, so that team members can gain GitLab platform expertise themselves more efficiently, and have fun and be rewarded for doing so.

Note the GitLab support organization utilizes ZenDesk for its [knowledge base services](/handbook/support/knowledge-base/).

Everyone in the Solution Architecture (SA), Customer Success (CS), Professional Services (PS) and SMB sales teams organizations, has access to the Stack Overflow for Teams via Okta and is able to answer questions or provide responses directly through the web interface.

Additionally, it is possible to interact with Stack Overflow using Slack integration using following commands:

- `/stack ask How do I do X?` to ask a question directly via Slack
- `/stack search [search term]` to search for questions and answers

Slack integration also posts notifications about new questions and answers via `#cs-questions` Slack channel for the entire team to stay up to date and boost participation. Adherent to and in support of GitLab's [efficiency value](/handbook/values/#efficiency) team members should first [search for an existing answer](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/self-service/) and post a question only if an answer is not readily available.

## How Stack Overflow KB differs from the Docs & Highspot

The knowledge base and our product documentation are both key elements of GitLab's digital support
experience that serve different needs:
