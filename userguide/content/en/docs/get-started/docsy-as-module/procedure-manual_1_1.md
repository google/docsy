This procedure manual explains how to execute a specific process within a company. It outlines what actions need to be taken, how tasks should be executed, and who is responsible within an organization.

1. Give your manual a title

Your procedure manual should be given a clear and intuitive title. You can make a general procedure manual or tailor your manual for a specific process.

[For example: “Procedure Manual for Sales Contact Follow-Ups”]

2. Explain the why

Use this section to list the rules on which your procedures are based, whether it is alignment with your company's mission and vision, legal regulations, or something else.

[For example: Our mission as a company is to empower individuals to find the right technology for their needs. Contact tracking is critical to building a good customer relationship. In order to align with our helpful & dignified brand, verbal and written communication must be respectful, clear, and easy to understand.]

3. Outline the document’s objective

Clearly state the objective of this procedure manual to your collaborators. This document should help them become more efficient and effective in their roles.

[For example: Our sales model relies on the Inbound Methodology, which is why we prefer that the first contact is made by the customer. However, once the customer contacts us, it is the responsibility of each member of the sales team to turn leads into customers. Please adhere to this manual so each customer is treated with the same dignity and respect during their purchase process.]

4. Describe the process

This is the most important part of your procedure manual. Here you will have to describe each of the desired actions, how to properly execute them, and the metrics with which they will be evaluated.
