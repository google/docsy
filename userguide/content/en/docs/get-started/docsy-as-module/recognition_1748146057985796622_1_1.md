### Engineering Quarterly Achiever's Chat

The Quarterly Achiever's Chat recognizes Engineering team members who have excelled in a given quarter by inviting them to join the Chief Technology Officer and 2 members of E-Group in a congratulatory chat. The benefit is three-fold:

1. Top performers receive facetime and recognition directly at the executive level
1. Knowledge sharing of best practices that can be replicated by other Engineering team members
1. Leaders/teams outside of the Engineering organization gain visibility into successes

Key features of this call include:

- 30-minute call
- Held within first two months of new quarter
- CTO and 2 E-Group Members attendance required
- Not recorded

### Engineering Quarterly Achiever's Recognition Dinner

As part of this initiative, Engineering Quarterly Achievers are able to expense a meal up to $250.00 USD within the same quarter they were selected in. For example, if a team member is selected as a Quarterly Achiever in November, they must expense their meal before the end of Q4 (the last day in January). Please submit your meal expense in Navan and in the description field link to this section of the handbook for approval.

The $250.00 USD is reimbursable for a meal only, other items do not qualify.

1. The team member has not won a Quarterly Achiever award within the current fiscal year

### Engineering Quarterly Achievers Timeline

## Engineering Quarterly Achievers Process

This process is followed by a delegate of the CTO Leads team at least 2 weeks before the end of the quarter, and is completed before the first all hands of the quarter.

### Accepting Nominations

1. Create a copy of the `Engineering Quarterly Achievers Nomination Form - Template` in the [`Awards [Quarterly]` folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=type:folder%20%22achievers%20quarterly%22) on Drive. If you do not have access, ask the CTO's EBA for access.
1. Make sure to add any new categories.
1. In the "Responses" tab, click "Link to Sheets" to collect responses in a Google Sheet rather than in the form itself.
1. In the "Responsess" tab, toggle "Accepting responses" on, and toggle it off when nominations close.

#### Communicating

1. Create a Field Operations - Enablement issue ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/enablement/-/issues/2394)) to get permission to post in `#field-fyi` for the "Contribution to Sales or Renewal" Award. This should be completed at least 2 weeks prior to launching the nomination period.
   - Consider posting a pre-filled link that selects that specific award.
1. In the Engineering Week in Review, add a note that nominations are open with a link to the form.
1. Make a Slack post in `#engineering-fyi`. Cross-post in `#cto`, and `#eng-managers`.
1. Consider posting reminders 1 week, and 1 day before due date.

### Selecting Winners

1. Pull the raw data from the nominations sheet and put it in a copy of `Engineering Quarterly Achievers Nominees Selection - TEMPLATE`. It's easier to collaborate on a Google Doc than a Google Sheet.
   - You can consider using `process-quarterly-achievers.rb` to process the data.
1. Make a copy of the `Engineering Quarterly Achievers All Hands Deck - TEMPLATE`
1. Follow the instructions in the template:
   - Choose DRIs for each area from among CTO Leads
   - Empower CTO Leads to make decisions
   - Direct CTO Leads to update the deck with names, photos and speaker notes that highlight the nomination.

### Announce Winners

For the next All-Hands, incorporate the final slides into primary deck! After All-hands, update this page with names of winners. Wooo! You're done until next quarter.

#### Inform Nominees

After winners have been announced, inform everyone who was nominated to spread awareness and happiness. Nominees should be informed privately, and without mentioning who nominated them.
