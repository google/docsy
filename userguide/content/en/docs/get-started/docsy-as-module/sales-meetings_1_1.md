## Field All-Hands Meetings

   1. [Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)](/handbook/sales/sales-meetings/#quarterly-business-reviews)
1. **Month 2**
   1. [WW Field Org Call](/handbook/sales/sales-meetings/#ww-field-org-call)
1. **Month 3**
   1. No all-hands meeting; quiet time for end-of-quarter activities.

For a full overview of the QBR planning and execution process, QBR request tracking, best-practices for organizers and attendees, and where to find past QBR content, [see here](/handbook/sales/qbrs).

### WW Field Org Call

- **When:** Quarterly in the second month of each quarter. Typically on a Monday or Tuesday in the morning PT for 50 minutes.
  - The call recording is shared with Japan/APAC team members once available with a CTA to watch the prepared remarks (watching the Q&A is not required). The CRO then leads a dedicated follow-up Japan/APAC Q&A session 1-3 business days after the initial call.
- **Who:** This meeting includes all members of the CRO organization as well as stakeholders of the Field team from the Marketing, Finance, Legal and People Groups.

Field attendance is informed by the sales-all Google Group, which is made up of all team sub-groups. Using this method, the calendar invite will auto-add new team members to the invite once they're added to their group.
  - If you are not in the Field organization, reach out in #sales-vp to be added to this meeting series,

### Focus Fridays

The Field team practices Focus Fridays. The goal is to encourage all field team members to clear out their calendars on Fridays as much as possible in hopes that this will help all of us be more efficient, allow space within our weeks for focused work, and reduce potential burnout. Guidance for Focus Fridays includes:

- Cancel or move any standing meetings occurring on Fridays
- Customer/prospect/partner/external meetings are exceptions
- Some one-off internal meetings might not be avoidable, but aim to minimize them as much as possible
- Consider blocking off your calendar as "busy" on Fridays to block your work time

You are encouraged to talk to your manager for guidance on how best to embrace Focus Fridays on your team and with your individual schedule.
