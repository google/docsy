### About

GitLab Hackathons bring our community together to improve GitLab. These quarterly events support Contributor Success by providing structured opportunities for community engagement and contribution.
For more information and live tracking, please visit the [hackathon page](https://about.gitlab.com/community/hackathon/).

### Workflow

- Owned by the [Contributor Success team](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/contributor-success/).
- Typically occurs once per quarter.
- Hackathons run for 7 days (UTC). Any MR opened during the hackathon week must be merged by 31 days after the hackathon week.
  - During the 7 day hackathon period, all `community contribution` MRs are automatically tagged with the `hackathon` label and count towards the hackathon.
- Leaderboard [here](https://contributors.gitlab.com/hackathon).
- Some hackathons have themes or special bonus prizes like:
  - Smash the most bugs for bonus credits to our [Contributor Success](https://gitlab-contributor.brilliantmade.com/) store.
  - Product teams create curated issue lists and award community bonuses, ex [Knowledge Group Hackathon list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/526773).

### Collaboration Opportuntites

Contributor Success welcomes new ideas/themes for the hackathon. Please reach out to us on `#contributor-success` on Slack for internal discussion.
