# Purchase Order Process and Procedure

## 1. Initiation

The purchase order (PO) process begins when there is a need for a product or service. The purchasing department creates a purchase order, which may be generated automatically for regular purchases.

## 2. Approval Process

The finance department reviews all purchase orders. The approval process varies depending on company requirements and determines who must authorize the purchase.

## 3. Submission to Supplier

Once approved, the PO is sent to the supplier. Upon acceptance by the supplier, it becomes a legally binding contract.

## 4. Shipping and Quality Control

The supplier dispatches the ordered items. Upon arrival, all items undergo quality inspection. Any discrepancies must be reported to the supplier immediately.

## 5. Three-Way Matching

Before processing payment, a three-way match is performed between:

- The purchase order

- The received goods

- The supplier's invoice

This ensures accuracy and prevents payment errors.

## 6. Documentation Requirements

In line with our Digital-Only Policy, all purchase order documentation will be stored and shared digitally. Physical copies will only be created when required by law or regulation.

## 7. Sustainable Procurement

All purchases must align with Green Orbit Digital's commitment to sustainability. We prioritize suppliers who:

- Share our commitment to sustainability

- Provide eco-friendly products and services

- Demonstrate commitment to reducing environmental impact

- Adhere to fair labor practices

## 8. Payment Terms

Standard payment terms include:

- Payment due within 30 days from invoice date

- Late fees of 5% per month may apply on overdue payments

- Disputed invoices must be reported within 7 days of receipt
