## **Onboarding Guide**

Welcome to the [Product Marketing team](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/core-product-marketing/)! Use the resources/videos on this page as a guide to help facilitate new team member onboarding. As more recording links and resources become available, we'll update this page accordingly.

**Each topic** covered in the tables below should be presented in 3-5 minutes or less through the handbook/screen share and recorded.  Exceptions: Vision, Pitch Deck, etc.  The goal of the completion time for PMM onboarding specific tasks is 1 day (except coffee chats).

#### Coffee Chats

Note: **Remember to complete your personalized company onboarding agenda.**
Pay special attention to the [**coffee chats**](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#coffee-chats). Typical onboarding suggests new team members to schedule at least 5 coffee chats.  Because PMMs must work cross-functionally,  relationships and connections are critical for success. We suggest scheduling ~20 coffee chats over 6 weeks. [Suggested list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dUe-ITJ27LvSdU7A5qMvGaYWt-KWk13HR_C27yC_REQ/edit) (Talk with your manager to pick names)
