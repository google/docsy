## What Was Done

### Model Experiment Tracking

- [Implemented Usage Metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/110642): The value proposition of this feature is harder to measure in quantitative terms, we will rely on qualitative metrics early on.
- Working on UX Review feedback:
  - [Experiment list improvement points](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387509)
  - [Candidates list improvement points](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/388207)

### Incubation Foundations: Invested time into Incubation components

Incubation Engineers face similar challenges when creating new areas, so we took a bit of time
to extract a few common patterns and develop some foundations to speed up bootstrapping. Making
it easier to deploy new pages reduce time to decision.

## Up Next

- Wrap up UX review before enabling the feature flag for general availability

- Get the closed test rolling. My goal is to recruit 3 of interest customers to test Ml Experiment Tracking, and act on
their feedback as fast as possible.
