## OKR Management Single-Engineer Group

The OKR Management SEG is a [Single-Engineer Group](/handbook/company/structure/#single-engineer-groups) within our [Incubation Engineering Department](/handbook/engineering/development/incubation/).

## Goal

To develop Objectives & Key Results(OKR) functionality within GitLab.

## Philosophy

To create an MVP that is:

* Very loose and un-opinionated to accommodate different styles of OKRs across companies, or departments within the same company
* Separate from planning and project management features, but optional linkage
* Accommodating of non-product development persona use from customer/user organizations

Specific areas that we aim to address within Incubation Engineering are:

* Ability to manually enter KR scoring and calculate rollups.
* Ability to automatically track the scoring of an objective by linked issues (linear attribution based on open/closed for linked issues).
* Reporting.
