Green Orbit Digital is committed to building a more sustainable internet. As a purpose-driven creative agency focused on space-enabled solutions for climate and sustainability, we believe digital design must be environmentally responsible, inclusive, and future-focused. This statement outlines our approach to sustainable web design and our ongoing alignment with the W3C Sustainable Web Design Guidelines.

# Our Commitment to Web Sustainability

We recognise that the internet contributes significantly to global carbon emissions and resource consumption. In response, Green Orbit Digital is actively embedding sustainability principles into the planning, design, development, and deployment of all our digital platforms.

Our approach is holistic, combining environmental, social, and economic responsibility to ensure our digital services contribute to a cleaner, more inclusive web.

# Principles We Follow

We design, build and manage websites in alignment with the following sustainability principles:

- Efficient: We optimise for low resource use to minimise energy consumption across devices, networks, and data centres.

- Resilient: We create digital services that are durable, accessible in low-connectivity environments, and maintainable over time.

- Open: We support interoperability, open standards, and freedom from unnecessary lock-in.

- Regenerative: We aim to not only reduce harm, but also create positive environmental and social impacts.

- Just: We advocate for equity and inclusion in digital spaces, ensuring that sustainability efforts uplift all communities.
