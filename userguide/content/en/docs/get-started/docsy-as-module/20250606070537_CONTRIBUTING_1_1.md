# Contributing

To add a new referrer spammer to the list, [click here to edit the spammers.txt file](https://github.com/matomo-org/referrer-spam-list/edit/master/spammers.txt) and create a pull request. Alternatively you can create a [new issue](https://github.com/matomo-org/referrer-spam-list/issues/new).

If you open a pull request, please:

- **add one new domain per pull request**
- explain where the referrer domain appeared and why you think it is a spammer
- name the pull request in the format `Add xxx.yyy` so that it's easy to manage duplicates (for example `Add cyber-monday.ga`)
- keep the list ordered alphabetically
- use [Linux line endings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline)

Please [search](https://github.com/matomo-org/referrer-spam-list/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+) if somebody already reported the host before opening a new one.
