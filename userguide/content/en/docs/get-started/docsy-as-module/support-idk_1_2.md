## Support Glossary

The Support Glossary contains definitions and explanations for support-related
acronyms and terms. Entries are alphabetically sorted and should link to or
include a definition source when possible.

The glossary was inspired by [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/issues/6327),
with the goal of providing definitions for terms that might be specific to
GitLab Support.

If you came to this page while reading a document with a missing definition,
please update the original page with the acronym expansion, to align with the
[acronyms and initialisms](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/content-style-guide/#acronyms-and-initialisms)
style.

<!-- The content of this page is automatically generated from the YAML file. Do not manually add definitions. -->
