<!-- Unsupported block type: table -->

Green Orbit Digital is a private company specialising in sustainable marketing. Our mission is to promote environmentally responsible practices through innovative marketing solutions. We are committed to maintaining high ethical standards in all our partnerships and sponsorships.

Ethical Considerations

Green Orbit Digital’s leadership team rigorously evaluates all potential partnerships and sponsorships to ensure they align with our ethical standards and sustainability goals.

International Partnerships

Green Orbit Digital adheres to guidance from the UK Government, including the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Department for International Trade. We will not engage with any organisation or individual subject to sanctions imposed or recognised by the British government.

Sustainability and Scientific Integrity

Green Orbit Digital reserves the right to decline partnerships or sponsorships with organisations or individuals who do not support sustainable practices or who oppose scientific consensus. This includes rejecting associations with entities that promote misinformation or undermine environmental and scientific integrity. Exceptions to this may only occur if the engagement offers a significant and public opportunity to advance meaningful debate and understanding in sustainability and science.

Engagement with Diverse Organisations

Green Orbit Digital actively seeks partnerships with organisations that enhance the understanding and application of sustainable marketing and technologies. However, we reserve the right to pause or cease engagement with any organisation or individual that contradicts our core values or sustainability objectives. Each case will be carefully reviewed by our leadership team to ensure alignment with our ethical standards.

Continuous Review

Green Orbit Digital continuously reviews this policy to ensure it remains relevant and effective. We are committed to fostering ethical partnerships and sponsorships that support our mission of promoting sustainability through responsible marketing practices.
