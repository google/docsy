## Overview

This document outlines the coding standards employed by the Digital Experience team across various projects and technology stacks. These guidelines ensure that our codebases remain clean, maintainable, and scalable as our ecosystem evolves. Key areas covered include project structure, naming conventions, component development, styling, JavaScript best practices, testing, and code review guidelines.

The goal is to foster a consistent development approach that enhances collaboration, reduces bugs, and delivers a high-quality user experience. By adhering to these standards, we strive to create a robust and efficient website aligned with modern web development best practices.

## Project Structure

* Define a clear and organized folder structure for all projects.  
* Keep related files and components together to improve discoverability and maintainability.

## Naming Conventions

* Use clear, descriptive, and consistent naming for files, components, and variables.

## Component Development

* Break down complex UI elements into smaller, reusable components.
* Ensure components are self-contained and do not have side effects.

### Linting

* Use ESLint with a shared configuration to enforce code quality and consistency.

## Accessibility

* Follow WCAG guidelines to ensure the website is accessible to all users.  
* Regularly test components and pages with screen readers and other accessibility tools.

## Testing

* Ensure end-to-end tests cover critical user flows to prevent regressions.

## Code Review Guidelines

* Conduct thorough code reviews to maintain high code quality.
* Focus on functionality, readability, and adherence to [general code standards(SOLID, DRY, KISS)](https://scalastic.io/en/solid-dry-kiss/)

## Additional Resources

For more detailed guidelines and examples, refer to the [Digital Experience repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/) you are workign with, specifcally the `/docs` directory.

By following these coding standards, we aim to maintain code quality, consistency, and readability across all projects.

 You can also find a lot of useful insights in the product team's [code review values](/handbook/engineering/workflow/reviewer-values/)â€”definitely worth a look!
