##### Quality

- Quad Planning & Test Coverage
  - Lead [Quad planning](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/test-platform/quad-planning/) efforts and optimize test coverage.
  - Create test strategy and implement test automation for new features.
  - Provide risk analysis and input on test strategy.
  - Identify and communicate must-have test coverage for critical functionality.
  - Refine tests at all levels to ensure efficient coverage and effective deduplication.
  - Steer the team to optimal test coverage by identifying gaps in functional and non-functional test automation, documenting missing coverage, and adding new test automation to improve coverage.
- Test Stability & Triage
  - Lead triage and test pipeline stabilization activities.
  - Participate in test pipeline on-call rotation and ensure that pipeline failures are triaged, addressed and communicated in a timely manner.
  - Take ownership of unquarantining flaky tests.
  - Work with Infrastructure and the counterpart group to address test failures related to test environments or bugs in code.
  - Identify and implement improvements to the process to make it more efficient.
- Test Tooling
  - Lead test stability resolution efforts for tests in production and non-production environments.
  - Lead and implement new test infrastructure tooling.
  - Optimize test pipelines to reduce feedback cycle.
  - Take initiative to recommend new approaches and processes that will improve our quality, productivity, and velocity.
  - Create and refine deploy processes, deployment scripts, and build pipelines.
- Test Environments
  - Grow your knowledge of GitLab provisioning and setup tools. Examples include Omnibus, the Orchestrator, Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, Helm Charts, GCP, or AWS.
  - Maintain or set up new GitLab test environments for your stable counterpart group in collaboration with other Software Engineers in Test.
- Task Management & OKRs
  - Owns KRs within team OKRs.
  - Establish due dates and approach for completing assignments; demonstrates project management skills as part of a larger team.
  - Exercises judgment and independently identifies the next steps.
  - Works closely with counterparts to anticipate, understand, and plan for upcoming work and roadblocks.
  - Contributes to progress of working group exit criteria.
- Knowledge Sharing
  - Clearly document, review, and broadly share our process and knowledge. This could be across mediums (recorded videos, written artifacts) and may include activities like:
    - Contributing to external content like GitLab blogs on interesting problems solved.
    - Recording demos and walk-throughs.
    - Mentoring other engineers.
- Domain specific expertise
  - Demonstrate domain specific responsibilities within their assigned product group.
