### Click-through Demos

Click-through demos are product simulation demonstrations that can be used for self-guided training. They are invaluable for delivering demos to customers in areas with limited internet connectivity or complex environments, where preparation is necessary to showcase the flow. Toggle off the click boxes and speaker notes using fn+F2 to experience the real look and feel of the product.

#### Internal Product tours

While the [product tours](#product-tours) provide guided walkthroughs with navigation dialogs and explanations at each step and can serve as self-guided tours for customers, the internal product tours are designed to help GitLab team members demo features to customers and prospects. These tours omit the explanation dialogs, creating a seamless live demo experience. Refer to the navigation guides to learn how to navigate through the flows.

### Workshops

The Developer Advocacy team maintains workshops in different product and focus areas. A workshop can be of different types: Hands-on with audience participating live in the exercises (training course), or showcase live demo/programming sessions where the audience engages with questions. Workshops should be created in collaboration with the [Solution Architect](/handbook/solutions-architects/) and  [Customer Success](/handbook/customer-success/) teams, and aligned with business goals.

> Note: Specific customer focussed workshops can be requested following the [customer consultancy handbook](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/consultancy/).

### Projects

Source code, demo projects, workshops, tutorials, research, etc. are documented in the [Projects handbook](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/projects/). This includes use cases for GitLab Duo (AI), CI/CD components, DevSecOps and Security, Workspaces, GitLab API, etc.

## Content Creation

### Videos

When creating product demos for video, please consider taking the following steps in VS Code: 

- Common resolution is 1920×1080 (16:9 aspect ratio) or 2880×1750 for screen recordings. 
- If you're connected to a 4K monitor, capture from your laptop.
- For social clips, consider square (1:1) for multi-platform compatibility or vertical (9:16).
- Zoom (`cmd` + `+`) once or twice more than you think you need to
- Simplify view by hiding unnecessary icons that are nested in top and bottom bars or using Zen mode,`cmd`+`k`+`z`
- Additional guidance can be found in the internal handbook: [dev environments](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/dev-environments)

### Product Tours

#### Guideline and tips for creating GitLab tours with Navattic

1. **Keep it concise** – Product tours should ideally have **5 to 12 steps**, each focused on delivering clear value. Unlike tutorials, which tend to be instructional, product tours should be quick and engaging.
2. **Provide context** – Add links to blog posts and documentation in pop-up dialogs to provide additional resources without cluttering the main content.
3. **Apply GitLab branding** – In the theme settings, select **"GitLab Branding [Navattic Team]"** to ensure a consistent design.
4. **Use the appropriate capture type** – Navattic supports two types of screen captures:
   - **Web captures** (preferred) create an in-product experience.
   - **Screenshots** should be used for non-web-based applications (e.g., IDEs).
5. **Set the correct resolution** – When capturing in Chrome, set your browser to **1680x1050 (Full HD)**. You can use [Window Resizer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh) to adjust the resolution.
6. **Include a call to action** – The final step should feature a **CTA**, typically a **Free Trial** link.
7. **Use Beacons to highlight elements** – Apply the **Highlight** appearance setting to emphasize key elements.
8. **Enable keyboard navigation** – This features in the tour settings allows users to navigate the tour using arrow keys for a smoother experience.
9. **Use Presenter Mode** – This feature hides pop-ups when necessary, ensuring a cleaner visual presentation.
10. **Set pop-ups appropriately**:
    - Use **Modals** with a **heavy backdrop** for the first and last steps.  
    - Use **Tooltips** for intermediate steps, enabling the **Backdrop setting** when appropriate.
11. In the Dialogs, please try using action-specific labels like "Commit," "Install," or "Submit" instead of "Next" to make users feel like they are actively engaging with the product.
12. **Refer to available examples** – Review [existing product tours](#product-tours) to understand the preferred format.
13. Before releasing any public facing product tour, request a review from the DA team.

#### Requesting Access to Navattic

If your team has special requirements for tours and you want to develop tours with Navattic yourself, we can help.

- We can offer a **3-month trial license** to team members who request access and provide a **valid business justification** for using Navattic.
- If a user actively utilizes the tool, we may **extend their access** or consider purchase additional licenses as needed.
- If a user is not actively using the tool, their license may be **reassigned** to another team member.
- To request access, open an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/developer-advocacy-meta/-/issues/new?issuable_template=other-activities)

For questions or assistance, reach out to us in our team channel: [#dev-advocacy-team](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/CMELFQS4B).

#### Publishing Product Tours

Product tours are published in the following locations:

- [DA Handbook](#product-tours)
- Highspot
- Docs (follow the GitLab documentation style guide for demo [links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/#link-to-click-through-demos))

Additionally, select tours may be featured on the website.

#### Contribute to product tours

The Developer Advocacy team creates product tours to showcase key workflows and highlight new features, such as **Advanced SAST**, **GitLab Duo**, **Duo with Amazon Q**, [and more](#product-tours). The team is committed to building, reviewing, and publishing product tours to ensure a consistent and high-quality experience for our users and potential customers. You can also contribute by proposing additional tours and provide the content, script, and environment. Here is how you can collaborate with the Developer Advocacy team to create new product tours:

1. Use the [product tour submission template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/developer-advocacy-meta/-/issues/new?issuable_template=product-tour-submission-template) to propose your idea.
1. Answer all the questions in the template. This ensures the Developer Advocacy team can evaluate your idea effectively.
1. The Developer Advocacy team will review the pitch and either a) greenlight the tour and suggest timeline for creation based on other priorities the team has, b) offer suggestions for improvements, or c) explain why the idea might not be a fit for the tour and offer other ideas for getting the message out.
1. Once a tour is approved, the author will use the **product tour template** (google doc) to draft the script. Link to the template exists in the [product tour submission template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/developer-advocacy-meta/-/issues/new?issuable_template=product-tour-submission-template).
1. Add a link to the template in a comment in the submisson template issue.
1. The Developer Advocacy team will collaborate with the author on the script, use Navattic to create the tour, and publish it in the official targets when applicable (for example, website, docs, HighSpot, Developer Advocacy handbook).

## Content Distribution

### UTMs for URL tagging and tracking

The Developer Advocacy team works with the Developer Relations Team [UTM Strategy](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/utm-strategy/), which is based on the larger [Marketing UTM strategy](/handbook/marketing/utm-strategy/). The `utm_content` prefix for the Developer Evangelism team is `de_`, this allows for easily filtering of the team's data in Sisense.

You can use the [UTM Generator](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/utm-strategy/#utm-generator) on the Community UTM Page to easily generate UTM Codes for your campaigns.

We use the following campaigns:

1. [Blog posts (general)](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/17) - All GitLab blog where we are not authors. Content tracking for social media.
1. [Blog posts (authors)](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/18) - GitLab blog posts where we are authors. Content tracking for social media.
1. [Talk resources (general)](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/13) - QR codes and short URLs for talk slides.
1. [Community newsletter](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/27) - community newsletter short URLs.
1. [Demos (TMM, DE)](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/50) - technical demos with standalone URLs.
1. [Release Evangelism](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/3) - [Release evangelism activities](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/social-media/#release-evangelism).
1. [Podcast resources](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/38) - URLs shared with podcast hosts.
1. [Contributed articles](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/47) - external articles shared on social media.

Event and content specific tracking examples are [KubeCon EU 2023](https://campaign-manager.gitlab.com/campaigns/view/36).

### Content Distribution Workflow

After content has been crafted and published, the next step is distribution. Here are some steps to assist in the process:

1. Use the [UTM Generator](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/utm-strategy/#utm-generator) to create UTM codes and short URLs for your content. Further insights about this can be found in the Developer Advocacy [UTM Strategy](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/utm-strategy/).

For documentation and community:

1. Tutorial blog posts, demos, etc. that are helpful to everyone should be added to the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/). Follow the contribution docs and create [related topics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/topic_types/#related-topics) headings if not existing. Raise an MR, use content short URLs, and ask the [assigned technical writer](/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/#assignments) to review. Example MR: [Add tutorial blog posts to workspaces docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/127500)
1. Consider sharing your content on one of our community platforms like the [GitLab Forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/) or the [r/gitlab](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab) subreddit. If you're covering a topic that's broader than GitLab, you can also consider other subreddits or cross-posting your content on blogging sites like dev.to.

For social media:

1. Draft some copy for sharing your content on social media. See [Content Sharing](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/social-media/#content) for tips and an overview of different platforms. Review the [message tips](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/social-media/#message-tips) for additional engagement ideas, e.g. emojis.
1. Suggest your content as a story on EveryoneSocial so other GitLab team members can also share it. [Details on how to suggest content on EveryoneSocial](/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/digital-strategy/social-marketing/team-member-social-advocacy/#suggesting-content-for-team-members-to-share-on-everyonesocial).
1. After posting your content on social media, share a link in the [`#social-media-action`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01AZ9C8Z4G) Slack channel to request promotion from the social media team.
