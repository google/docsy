title: Charitable Contribution Requests
---

If you have a request to donate GitLab funds to a charitable cause, please refer to the [Philanthropy Policy](/handbook/legal/philanthropy-policy/#gitlab-inc-philanthropy-policy) for more information about who we support, how we support, exclusions, and delegations/approvals.

Once all necessary approvals have been documented for your charitable contribution, if the donation is >$5,000, we will need to set the recipient up in Coupa and follow the PO process in order to issue payment. Please [create a purchase request in Zip]({{< ref "_index.md#-how-do-i-create-a-purchase-request-in-zip" >}}) to get the organization registered and to process payment. If the donation is <$5,000, please contact AP@gitlab.com to process payment as an exception to the PO process. Please note that if it is a new recipient that we have not paid before, an invitation to register in Coupa will be sent to the main contact on file to get their payment & tax information set up in the system.
