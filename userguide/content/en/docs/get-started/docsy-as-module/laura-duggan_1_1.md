## About me

I'm a frontend developer originally educated in UX and product design. I attended a coding bootcamp, fell in love with CSS, and the rest is history. If you're into accessible design and execution, I'm sure we'll be great friends.

Here's a [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQJnk2B_p5s) I did at ForwardJS on the elements of a design system that developers love.

## Impactful Books

* **Ruined By Design, by Mike Monteiro** takes a look at the ethical considerations designers need to fight for when building a product.
* **Reset, by Ellen Pao** tells the journey of the former venture-capitalist-turned-Reddit-CEO and her experiences of mysogony, discrimination, and retaliation in the tech and finance industries.
* **The Undoing Project, by Michael Lewis** examines the Nobel-Prize-winning duo of behavioural psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, and how they changed perceptions on decision-making.

## Strengths/Weaknesses/Musings

* I am not a morning person - I apologize in advance.
* I might second-guess myself, and love having a sounding board of teammates to talk through ideas.
* Everything I build is going to be as pixel-perfect as possible.
* I'm a cat person, but I've been told I have 'dog person energy' so do with that what you will.
* I like wine and coffee. Not in like, a snobby way; more in a 'just happy to be here' way.
* I celebrate my birthday with a week-long event called LauraPalooza. Is that a strength or a weakness? I'll let you decide.

## Communication Preferences

Message me on slack, send me an email, tag me in an issue - I like when things are written down and documented, since sometimes I don't trust my own memory. If we discuss something on a zoom call, I will likely post a summary of anything we agreed upon for my own recollection.
