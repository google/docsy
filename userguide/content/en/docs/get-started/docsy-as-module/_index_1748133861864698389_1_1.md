## Welcome to the People Operations Team Handbook

- Our Mission is to provide extraordinary People support by developing and implementing policies, programs, and services that contribute to our team members' healthy, safe, and productive work environment.

## People Operations Teams at GitLab

Here are how the team members divide their work to ensure the best results:

- The **People Connect Team** is responsible for onboarding, career mobility, offboarding, bonus processing, People Connect, personal information oversight, new hire/anniversary swag, and more. This team is also responsible for job changes (promotions and transfers), relocations, basic People data reporting, and process liaisons during new policy and program implementations.
- The **Employment Solutions Team** is responsible for our country and location roadmap as we consider which countries to hire in, and which employment solution is best.  The team participates in the 'Business Expansion Committee' to develop a plan of country conversions, new country creations and changes in employment solutions to reduce risk and improve the team member experience.  This team also supports relocations and visa/sponsorship inquiries and needs.
- The **[People Compliance](/handbook/people-group/people-compliance/) Team** works collaboratively to partner, manage and protect our Team Members personal and professional information, ensuring documentation confidentiality, and implements global compliance requirements to help meet internal  stakeholder expectations.
- The **People Tools & Technology Team**
- The **[People Analytics Team](/handbook/people-group/people-ops-tech-analytics/people-analytics)** is responsible for working with stakeholders to develop and report various People Metrics and KPIs for the business. Additional insight is also providing using statistical analysis or experimental design to help understand effects of different People related initiatives.
- The **People Engineering Team**

## How We Work

### Responsibilities

People Operations is a Department under the [People](/handbook/people-group) Division.

### HelpLab

The People Operations Department primarily uses HelpLab as the primary tool for all GitLab's People Operations-related queries. This is where folks from other teams can ask for help, direction, and receive answers or direction to the correct team from the People Connect team.

You can also tag subsets of the People Operations Team in other slack channels using:

- @peopleanalyticstriage - this should be used in the [#data](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C8D1LGC23) channel when there are questions or concerns about people data in dashboards or Snowflake
