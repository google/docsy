## People Group Spotlight

The People Group is spotlighting stories of our team members in Slack. This program originated out of team member feedback from our FY24 Engagement Survey results around increasing visibility to collaboration and career growth opportunities within our division.

The purpose of these spotlights are to further our goal of "one team" by:

1. Sharing career growth stories of People Group team members
1. Increasing awarness of what teams across the People Group are working on
1. Creating deeper connection amongst People Group team members
