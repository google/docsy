**All team members and contractors must protect our Company assets, such as equipment, supplies, cash, and information. Treat Company assets with the same care you would if they were your own. No team member or contractor may commit theft, fraud or embezzlement, or misuse Company property.**

## Guidelines

1. As a public company, GitLab has an obligation to act in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders. This obligation is shared by all team members and is the basis of our global travel and expense policy as a public company; team members must be thoughtful in spending the Company's money.
1. Spending Company money includes travel and expenses.
1. You may privately use GitLab property, a MacBook for example, to check your private e-mails or watch a movie as long as it does not violate the law, harm GitLab, or interfere with Intellectual Property. More details can be found in the [Internal Acceptable Use Policy](/handbook/people-group/acceptable-use-policy).
1. File your expense report in a timely manner, as expense claims over 90 days from purchase date will not be reimbursed unless approved by your Manager.  The sooner it is submitted, the sooner you will get reimbursement.
1. If team members knowingly submit expenses for reimbursement for personal purchases that are not covered in the expense policy, this is a violation of our [Code of Business Conduct & Ethics](https://ir.gitlab.com/static-files/7d8c7eb3-cb17-4d68-a607-1b7a1fa1c95d).
