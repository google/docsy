We will kick off the holiday season on December 8 by _optionally_ participating in a Secret Santa exchange - an exchange where a group of colleagues will exchange holiday presents anonymously with each member of the group being assigned to another member to provide a small gift.

1. The exchange amount will be $30 USD, including shipping and tax fees. This amount cannot be expensed and would need to be paid for out of pocket. Team members are not required to participate.
1. [A form has been provided](https://forms.gle/NXCXbWWWbF2HeSk4A) to sign up. This form will include ideal gift ideas for yourself, as well as your formatted mailing address, and local / online stores to choose your gift from.
1. The form will close on December 13. At this time, your Secret Santa will be randomly selected and you will be given the name of a team member to buy a gift for, their ideal gift idea and local buying options if available.
1. Your address will not be shared with anyone other than the person sending your gift, and the organizer (@wortschi).
