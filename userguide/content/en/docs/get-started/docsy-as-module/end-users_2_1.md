{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}

End-user settings changes are classified as ad-hoc as the changes are made directly in Zendesk. Once changes are made in Zendesk they are live.

Changes to these can cause severe problems if you have not thoroughly tested them. Exercise extreme caution before proceeding.

## Modifying end user settings

You will make the change directly in Zendesk. Remember any changes should also be reflected in the [end-users documentaiton](../../docs/zendesk/tickets) (as it is the single source of truth).
