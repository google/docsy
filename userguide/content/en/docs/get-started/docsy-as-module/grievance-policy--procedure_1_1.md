1. Introduction

At Green Orbit Digital, we are committed to providing a positive work environment where employees feel respected, valued, and supported. However, we recognize that issues or concerns may arise from time to time, and it is important for employees to have a formal mechanism to address grievances. This Grievance Policy outlines the procedure for employees to raise and resolve grievances in a fair, timely, and confidential manner.

2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees of Green Orbit Digital, including full-time, part-time, temporary, and contract employees. It covers grievances related to employment conditions, work environment, interpersonal conflicts, discrimination, harassment, and other work-related issues.

3. Principles

- Fairness: Grievances will be addressed impartially, without bias or favoritism.

- Confidentiality: Information related to grievances will be handled confidentially, with disclosure limited to individuals directly involved in the resolution process.

- Timeliness: Grievances will be addressed promptly and resolved within a reasonable timeframe.

- Respect: Employees raising grievances will be treated with respect and dignity throughout the process.

- No Retaliation: Green Orbit Digital prohibits retaliation against employees who raise grievances in good faith.

4. Informal Resolution

Employees are encouraged to attempt to resolve grievances informally before initiating a formal grievance procedure. This may involve discussing concerns with their immediate supervisor, HR representative, or another trusted colleague. Informal resolution methods may include open communication, mediation, or conflict resolution techniques.

5. Formal Grievance Procedure

If a grievance cannot be resolved informally or if an employee prefers to pursue a formal process, the following steps should be followed:

- Step 1: Submission of Grievance: The employee must submit a written grievance outlining the nature of the grievance, relevant details, and desired outcome, to their immediate supervisor or the HR department. If the grievance involves the immediate supervisor, the employee may bypass this step and submit the grievance directly to HR.

- Step 2: Investigation: Upon receipt of the grievance, HR will initiate an investigation to gather relevant information and evidence. This may involve interviewing the employee raising the grievance, the individual(s) against whom the grievance is raised, and any witnesses. HR will maintain confidentiality throughout the investigation process.

- Step 3: Resolution Meeting: Following the investigation, HR will arrange a meeting with the employee raising the grievance to discuss the findings and potential resolution options. The employee may be accompanied by a colleague or union representative if desired.

- Step 4: Decision and Appeal: HR will communicate the decision regarding the grievance to the employee in writing. If the employee is dissatisfied with the outcome, they may appeal the decision within a specified timeframe (e.g., 7 days). The appeal will be reviewed by a senior manager or an independent panel, and their decision will be final.

6. Records and Documentation

All documentation related to grievances, including written complaints, investigation reports, meeting minutes, and decisions, will be retained in a confidential and secure manner in accordance with data protection laws and retention policies.

7. Training and Awareness

Green Orbit Digital will provide training to managers and HR personnel on handling grievances effectively, including conflict resolution skills, impartiality, confidentiality, and compliance with the grievance policy.

8. Review and Revision

This Grievance Policy will be periodically reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure its effectiveness and compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

9. Contact Information

For questions or assistance regarding grievances, employees should contact the HR department.
