## Project Coordination- Consulting

### Consulting Project Scheduling

[Lead Time for Professional Services Engagement](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/working-with/#lead-time-for-starting-a-professional-services-engagement)

[The PS Opportunity has closed, whats next](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/working-with/#scheduling-professional-services)

If project work is required to start the project prior to the opportunity booking, then the [Work At Risk Process](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/project-mgmt/#work-at-risk) would need to be followed and approved.

### Customer Consulting Project Scheduling

The consulting operations team has a [board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/ps-plan/-/boards/3487648?label_name[]=pc-consulting-checklist) to track the scheduling progress of the consulting projects.  There is a [checklist](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/ps-plan/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/pc-consulting-checklist.md) that is utilized to track the progress of each project as we work through Kantata project set up, project team assignment and partner paperwork. There is also a [Project Scheduling Intake Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/ps-plan/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/SchedulingPreparation.md) in which we request information pertinent to the scheduling process.

### Scheduling Request for Consulting Projects

We do understand we may have circumstances to plan for a project before a SF Stage 5, but we would like to have most of the information met prior to contacting PS Operations.

| Action |DRI |
| ------ | ------ |
| SF Opportunity is at least a stage 5 | Opportunity Owner |
| Forecast category is Commit | Opportunity Owner |
| Customer has agreed to the SOW | Opportunity Owner |
| PS Quote has been created on the opportunity | Opportunity Owner |
| Executed MSA/PSA | Opportunity Owner |
| Agreed close plan with the customer | Opportunity Owner |
| Skills pushed to the Customer Epic | Assigned Engagement Manager |
| [Project Scheduling Intake Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/ps-plan/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/SchedulingPreparation.md) populated with required details | Assigned Engagement Manager |

For staffing requirements or questions, add the details to the Project Scheduling Intake Issue and tag the assigned Project Coordinator.  If there is not a Project Coordinator assigned, tag the Operations Manager for assistance and assignment will be completed at that time. Moving forward, the Project Scheduling Intake Issue will house all information and discussions regarding scheduling. The PC Checklist will only be used internally by the Project Coordinator.

#### Internal Project Scheduling

If a Team Member would like to have time blocked on their schedule to allow time for non-customer project related items, certifications, or ramp up,
a request should be submitted via a comment and tag the PC on either Internal Projects:

- PS Time Tracking Non-Creditable

Comment should be added to the activity page to include the following:

- Task
- Time Required
- Priority Level

The PC will review availablity and schedule the time on the Master Planning with an allocation.

#### Consulting Project Assignment

When the PC and PM have the project team aligned the PC will send [Consulting Project Assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HfIt30ksOlhv3zAxh8ZPX-5J59maiuhNgZT2E5lMpsk/edit) in the Kantata project activity, this allows the team to be aware of who will be working on the project.

#### Consulting Projects Billing Guidelines

Project billing is outlined in each customer SOW or Order Form.  The current billing terms that Professional Services follows is the following:

- Billed upon SOW execution
- Order Form execution
- Time and Materials
- Project miletone
- Billed half up front and half at project completion
- Billed at completion

Passive acceptance of 5 days is included in the SOW unless different terms are negotiated by the customer and approved by the Director of Professional Services.

#### Consulting Projects Revenue Forecasting Guidelines

Project revenue release is followed dependant on project billing type:

- Billed upon SOW execution billing terms
  - SOW contains milestones that include activities, and revenue can be released as each milestone is                 accepted or passive acceptance is reached
- Billed upon Order Form execution billing terms
  - SOW contains milestones that include activities, and revenue can be released as each milestone is                 accepted or passive acceptance is reached
- Time and Materials billing terms
  - Approved time sheet hours reported at each month end
- Project milestone SOW billing terms
  - SOW contains milestones that include activities, and revenue can be released as each milestone is                 accepted or passive acceptance is reached
- Billed half up front and half at project completion SOW billing terms
  - SOW contains milestones that include activities, and revenue can be released as each milestone is                 accepted or passive acceptance is reached
- Billed at completion billing terms
  - SOW contains milestones that include activities, and revenue can be released as each milestone is                 accepted or passive acceptance is reached

#### How To Forecast Revenue For Consulting Projects

##### T&M Projects

T&M project revenue is forecasted by scheduled soft or hard allocations in the Master Planning in Kantata.  The hours that are schedule are multiplied by the rate card on the project.

##### Fixed Priced Projects

Fixed priced projects are forecasted by the project milestones in the Kantata project.  Each milestone has a sign off task, that task is updated with correct sign off date for the activities in the milestone.  Best practice is update the sign off task to give time for the customer to review and obtain acceptance from the customer.
If there is not confidence that the activities will be complete and the customer will sign off, then the Sign Off task should be moved out to the next quarter.

#### Revenue Sign Off

##### Revenue Release T&M Projects

For T&M projects, revenue is released at each month end. Project hours are submitted weekly via the time sheet function in Kantata. The PSE or PM submits time against the project, and the Project PM or Lead approves on a weekly basis. Each month end, the PC pulls a report of all approved time sheets and provides the consolidated report to Finance to review and release the revenue.

##### Revenue Release FP Projects

For FP projects, revenue is released when customer acceptance is received or passive acceptance has passed as it pertains to the project SOW language.
The PM sends out the request for acceptance to the customer and then updates the Billing/ Revenue Milestone in Kantata.  When sending out the acceptance email, the PM should copy the Operations Manager and the assigned Project Coordinator.  When counting the passive acceptance days, day 1 would be the date the notification is sent, from the date sent then business days is calculated for the passive acceptance.

 The PM is responsible for updating the following for the project milestone in Kantata:

- Update custom field, _Sign Off Sent_, when email request is sent
- Update custom field, _Sign Off received_, when acceptance is received or Passive Acceptance is reached. and add the PDF email of acceptance to the Milestone
- Update custom field, _Passive Acceptance Utilized for Sign Off_, if passive acceptance is utilized
- If acceptance is received, attach the email (PDF) of acceptance or the signed [milestone document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RiS5TY5484nQuDTW8YMiB-CibVfoni7NJ8IUG2osUD0/edit) to the Milestone
- If passive acceptance is reached, attach the email (PDF) and the [milestone document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RiS5TY5484nQuDTW8YMiB-CibVfoni7NJ8IUG2osUD0/edit) to the Milestone

Please note only the **top level** milestone fields should be updated. The sub activities within the milestone should **not** be updated.

## Project Coordination- Training

### Train

PSEs or Technical Instructors who deliver GitLab Education Services instructor-led courses can use the following workflow to ensure smooth interactions with customers. In addition, PSEs and Technical Instructors should complete these [GitLab Certified Trainer](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/gitlab-certified-trainer-process/) steps for each course they are scheduled to deliver.

#### Preparation steps

1. Professional Services Operations will contact the customer with a "Welcome to Education Services Email" to initiate the training scheduling.  After the training dates and times are confirmed, Professional Services Operations will schedule a training session planning meeting. Trainer participation in this meeting is recommended -- please let the assigned Professional Services Operations team member know if you need the meeting to be rescheduled to ensure your attendance.

1. Professional Services Operations will use these [email communication templates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rJ9q9gEzsumRxDhoWEe45u70efmKA0eWNg69WONuCYs/edit?usp=sharing) to ensure communication of the key details with the customer and training participants.

1. During the training planning meeting, be sure to discuss and document all of the event logistics listed in the [Training Event Plan Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1huNauyfhFPvLCuo-9T7Ol3FtBDYowYxiP_T5ItP2FN4/edit?usp=sharing). Professional Services Operations will create a draft of the Training Event Plan prior to the meeting and update the document during the training planning meeting.
   - During the training planning meeting, the course outline and system requirements pages below are useful to use to review training logistics, topics, teleconferencing, and system requirements.
      - Refer to the [Education Services handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/services/education/) for the complete list of Instructor-Led Training offerings.
      - [System Requirements](https://university.gitlab.com/pages/gitlab-ilt-sysreq)

1. Professional Services Operations will set up a Zoom Meeting or Webinar session for each session using [these set up instructions](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/remote-training-session-setup/) and add the registration link(s) to the issue. You will receive an email message with your unique link to join the Zoom Meeting or Webinar session. Make sure to locate the Zoom information within the email message and familiarize yourself with the Zoom functionality. Here is a useful Zoom article for [Managing Attendees and Panelists in a Webinar](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0063276). Depending on your Zoom set up, you may want to log into https://zoom.us, go to Join a Meeting, and enter the meeting ID/webinar ID to start the Zoom session.

1. At least 2 weeks prior to the training session, Professional Services Operations will email the session registration link(s) to the customer, asking them to send the link(s) to each of the employees whom they want to attend the session(s). When each person registers, they will receive an automated confirmation email with a Zoom Meeting or Webinar join link unique to each person, along with a link to add the session to their calendar.

1. Professional Services Operations will advise if a different teleconferencing system is being used for the training and provide additional details for accessing the teleconferencing meeting.

1. Contact the GitLab Education Services team to confirm you have the latest versions of course slides and other materials.

1. Review the train-the-trainer (T3) video for the course you are delivering.

1. Review and follow the [Instructor Pre-Training Checklist](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/processes/delivery-checklists/) to ensure that you are properly prepared for your delivery.

1. Review, practice, and use these [PS Remote Training Tips and Tricks](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/remote-training-tips/).

1. Complete the GitLab Training Lab set up steps below. Make sure that you review the lab exercises and ensure that the labs are working properly prior to the first day of class.

1. When it's time to join the teleconferencing as a presenter, use the provided information to join the session.

##### Training lab pre-course instructor workflow

PS uses the [GitLab Lab Environment](https://gitlabdemo.com/) as the standard environment for hands-on course lab activities and hands-on certification assessments. Follow these steps to set up your course attendees for lab access.

**1. GitLab lab environment invitation codes**

1. Professional Services Operations will generate the invitation code for your class and provide the invitation code information approximately a week prior to your class start date as part of the instructor friendly reminders post within your Kantata project.
1. Follow the instructions on the [GitLab Lab Environment Invitation Code Redemption handbook page](/handbook/customer-success/demo-systems/#invitation-code-redemption) to redeem the invitation code and access the lab environment.
1. For any edits/extensions/etc or any custom redemption rules (different durations than our standards), contact the GitLab Professional Services Operations team for assistance.

**2. Share the invitation code and access instructions with attendees**:

1. On the first day of class, share the invitation code and review the login process with the attendees. Also let them know the expiration date (which is 30 days from the date they generate the login).

#### Training Closeout

1. Review the [Instructor Post-Training Checklist](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/processes/delivery-checklists/) to ensure that you have followed all of the steps to close out your training class.
1. Professional Services Operations will download the attendance report and send a close out email to the customer using an email template located in the [email communication templates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rJ9q9gEzsumRxDhoWEe45u70efmKA0eWNg69WONuCYs/edit?usp=sharing).

### Training Projects Billing Guidelines

Training billing is outlined in each customer SOW or Order Form.  The current billing terms that Professional Services follows is the following:

- Billed upon SOW
- Order Form execution

Passive acceptance of 5 days is included in the SOW unless different terms are negotiated by the customer and approved by the Director of Professional Services.

### Training Projects Revenue Forecasting Guidelines

Training revenue release is followed dependent on training billing type:

- Billed upon SOW
  - Once each training class is complete and roster is received
- Order Form execution billing terms
  - Once each training class is complete and roster is received

### How To Forecast Revenue Training Projects

Training projects are typically considered fixed priced projects and are forecasted by the project milestones in the Kantata project.  Each milestone includes tasks for each training course that are used to capture training preparation/planning/closeout and delivery hours.  Each task is updated with the correct due date for the activities in the milestone.  Best practice is to ensure that the task due dates are updated to accurately reflect training completion dates for forecasting purposes.
If there is not confidence that the activities will be complete, then the task due date should be moved out to the next quarter.

### Revenue Release Training Projects

For training projects, revenue is released when training is complete and/or when acceptance is received dependent on the project SOW language.
If required per the project SOW, Professional Services Operations sends the request for acceptance to the customer and then updates the Billing/ Revenue Milestone in Kantata

- Update Sign Off Sent, when training is complete or email request is sent
- Update Sign Off received, when training is complete, acceptance is received, or Passive Acceptance is reached and add the class roster or PDF email of acceptance to the Milestone
- Update if Passive Acceptance has been utilized for sign off

### Time Tracking

Accurate time tracking records of hours is essential to ensure revenue can be recognized based upon percentage completion of a project scope as outlined in a Statement of Work ("SOW"), and this data is used in the calculation of gross margin. Key points for time tracking include:

- Best practice is to record time at the end of each day. This provides the most accurate account of hours worked and when it was worked
- Each PSE is required and responsible for tracking their own hours, and submitted weekly by Friday EOD for the week worked
- If time will be worked over the weekend, time sheet should still be submitted by Friday, EOD, then a new line created on the time sheet for hours worked over the weekend
- Billable hours represent work hours that a staff member reports as being aligned to a specific SOW. The format for daily time tracking for each team member is shown below, and is reviewed weekly by PS Operations and Manager
- Hours for PTO, Holidays and Family and Friends day are no longer required to be submitted in the weekly time sheet
- If a team member did not work the time allocated for the week, then hours would be added to the PTO feature in Kantata
- Notes are not required for the PS Time Tracking - Non Creditable project
- Notes may be required for customer projects, please confirm with your Project/Program Manager before submitting time

  - PTO should be submitted in the time off feature in Kantata, and also follow the company guidelines, [time off process](/handbook/people-group/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off)
  - Holidays along with Family and Friends day are scheduled on the Kantata calendar

- Time is required to round to the nearest quarter hour, example:
  - 15m should be .25
  - 30m should be .5
  - 45m should be .75

****Kantata Internal Projects****

Internal projects are set up to track internal time that is not customer project related. Below is the project link along with tasks and examples.

- [PS Time Tracking - Non Creditable](https://gitlab.mavenlink.com/workspaces/34595955/?tab=project-workspace)

****Customer consulting projects****

#### Making Engagement Epic and Issues Partner Accessible

##### Background

- [PS automation](https://gitlab.com/services-calculator/services-calculator.gitlab.io) creates engagement epics in [Professional-Services-Group](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/-/epics) and issues in [PS-Plan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/ps-plan/-/issues).
- It's useful to move the epics of engagements that require partner access to [Professional-Servies-Group > Consulting Delivery](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/-/epics)

##### Notes

- Epics can not currently be moved so instead we recreate the epic in the new location, move the subordinate issues to the new location and close the original epic as described in _Directions_ below.
- The original and new epics are linked via their issue move audit entries.
- The directions do not use a [bulk edit](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#bulk-edit-issues-from-a-project) due to [this epic search issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233729).

##### Directions

- Open the to-be-recreated epic in a browser tab
- Open the [destination epics list UI](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/-/epics) in another browser tab
  - _New Epic_
    - Title - `Customer Name` Customer Project Epic
    - Description - copy and paste description markdown from the original epic (current in the other browser tab)
