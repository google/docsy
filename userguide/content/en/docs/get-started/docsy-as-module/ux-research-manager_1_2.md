> ### Why we ask for a pre-recorded presentation
>
> 1. It helps create a shared understanding of your work between you and our interviewers ahead of the first interview.
> 1. It allows us to ask more informed questions about your experience and work during the interview process.
> 1. Generally, we [avoid using meetings as a means to present](/handbook/communication/#common-meeting-problems). Instead, we record presentations, upload to our Unfiltered Youtube channel, and use a meeting as a Q&A. This interview exercise provides you with an opportunity to experience this style of work.
>
> ### Presentation Topics
>
> 1. An introduction: who you are, where you're based, your background, and why you're a UX Research Manager.
> 1. An overview of two case studies. One (1) should be an overview of a high-impact individual project. We want to understand how you approached the research questions, how you synthesized research data to inform product and design decisions, the challenges you faced along the way, and the impact your research had.  The second (2) should be something related to your people management experiences. We want to understand your management style & why you decided to become a people manager. We'd also like to understand the details of a project you've led as a Manager. This could be a story on how you overcame some kind of challenge, a process you introduced that had a lot of impact, or how you coached an employee to success. We want to understand: the size, discipline make-up, and structure of the team you were a part of; the goals of the project; what you personally did on the project, the challenges you faced throughout the project; and the meaningful business impact that the research resulted in.
>
> ### What we're looking for
>
> - A recording that is up to 20 minutes in duration and returned to us within ten days of your screening call being completed.
> - You share the recording using either a [private Youtube link](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), a [Google Drive link](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), or a [Loom link](https://www.loom.com/).

>
> - Unsure on where to get started? Check out our [handbook page on recording a presentation in Zoom](/handbook/tools-and-tips/zoom/#how-to-share-a-presentation-in-zoom). A free Zoom account is all you'd need to complete this presentation.

> - We work with a [low level of shame](/handbook/values/#low-level-of-shame) at GitLab. In this context, this means we don't expect your presentation to be highly polished.
