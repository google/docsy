## Overview

To help protect company data and improve collaboration, any yellow, orange, or red data should be stored in Google Drive, GitLab issue or repository code, or in the handbook.

**Do not enable Apple iCloud Drive**.

iCloud has the ability to store desktop and documents in iCloud. GitLab uses Google Drive for document and file storage, so please make sure this feature is disabled. This can be unchecked during installation or reconfigured later using the instructions below.
