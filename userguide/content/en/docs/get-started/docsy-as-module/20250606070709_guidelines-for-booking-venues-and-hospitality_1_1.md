Proper planning and adherence to these guidelines will help to create positive experiences for both internal and external stakeholders while maximizing the value of the company's resources.

2. Booking Process

- Approval: All bookings of venues and hospitality services must receive prior approval from the appropriate authority within the company, typically the department head or designated budget holder.

- Consideration of Alternatives: Employees responsible for booking venues and hospitality should consider multiple options to ensure that the selected venue or service meets the needs of the event or meeting while offering value for money.

- Budget Management: Bookings should be made within the allocated budget for the event or meeting. Any deviations from the budget must be approved by the appropriate authority.

3. Venue Selection Criteria

When selecting a venue for an event or meeting, the following criteria should be considered:

- Location: The venue should be easily accessible to all attendees, taking into account transportation options and proximity to public amenities.

- Capacity: The venue should have adequate space to accommodate the expected number of attendees comfortably.

- Facilities: The venue should offer facilities and amenities that meet the requirements of the event, such as audiovisual equipment, catering services, and parking facilities.

- Ambiance: The ambiance and atmosphere of the venue should align with the nature and purpose of the event, whether it is formal, casual, or professional.

4. Hospitality Services

When arranging hospitality services, such as catering, the following guidelines should be observed:

- Dietary Requirements: Catering options should be inclusive of attendees' dietary preferences and restrictions, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and halal options.

- Quality and Presentation: Hospitality services should prioritize quality and presentation to create a positive impression on attendees.

- Cost-Effectiveness: While quality is important, efforts should be made to ensure that hospitality services are cost-effective and represent value for money.

5. Compliance and Documentation

- Contracts and Agreements: All bookings of venues and hospitality services should be supported by written contracts or agreements outlining the terms and conditions of the booking, including pricing, cancellation policies, and any additional services included.

- Compliance with Policies: Bookings must comply with company policies, including those related to procurement, budget management, and code of conduct.

6. Review and Feedback

After each event or meeting, organizers should conduct a review to assess the effectiveness of the venue and hospitality services. Feedback from attendees should be solicited to identify areas for improvement and inform future booking decisions.

7. Conclusion

Compliance with these guidelines is essential to uphold the company's reputation and financial stewardship.



Green Orbit Digital Guidelines for Booking Venues and Hospitality

1. Introduction

At Green Orbit Digital, we aim to create exceptional experiences for both employees and clients, while maintaining sustainability as a core principle in all our operations. The booking of venues and hospitality is an essential part of our business activities, whether it be for meetings, events, or client hospitality. These guidelines ensure that the process is efficient, compliant with our policies, and aligns with our sustainability goals.

1. General Booking Guidelines

When booking a venue or hospitality service, all bookings should:

Align with the purpose of the event or meeting.

Be cost-effective and appropriate to the nature of the event.

Ensure accessibility for all attendees.

Prioritise sustainability, including venues with relevant sustainability certifications and eco-friendly practices.

Be booked in advance to avoid unnecessary last-minute arrangements.

Comply with Green Orbit Digital’s Expense Policy and Environmental Procurement Policy (EPP).

1. Expense Policy

The expense policy governs all spending on venues and hospitality, ensuring that company funds are used responsibly and efficiently. The following key points apply to all venue and hospitality bookings:

Approval: All venue and hospitality bookings must be pre-approved by the relevant budget holder or manager. This includes any associated costs (e.g., catering, additional services).

Reasonable Spending: Expenses should reflect the nature and scale of the event. Luxury or excessive spending will not be permitted unless explicitly justified by the business purpose (e.g., for high-profile client meetings).

Receipts and Documentation: All bookings must be documented, and receipts must be submitted for reimbursement or payment. This applies to both internal events and external hospitality bookings.

Alcohol and Entertainment: Any expenditure on alcohol or entertainment should be reasonable and aligned with the event’s purpose. The provision of alcohol must be approved in advance and should not exceed the allocated budget.

Personal Expenses: Personal expenses should never be charged to the company, and any such charges will not be reimbursed.

1. Environmental Procurement Policy (EPP)

Green Orbit Digital is committed to incorporating sustainability into all aspects of its operations. As such, venues and hospitality providers should align with the company's Environmental Procurement Policy (EPP). The policy encourages the following:

Sustainable Venues: When choosing venues for meetings, events, or hospitality, preference should be given to those that have credible sustainability certifications, such as:

Green Key

BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method)

ISO 14001

Carbon Trust Standard

EarthCheck

These certifications demonstrate that the venue has committed to sustainable practices in areas such as energy efficiency, waste reduction, water conservation, and eco-friendly sourcing.

Eco-friendly Catering: When booking catering services, choose providers that offer organic, locally sourced, seasonal food options and minimise packaging waste. Where possible, select catering that offers plant-based, low-carbon meals.

Waste Reduction: Venues should be chosen for their waste management practices, ensuring they recycle and dispose of waste responsibly. Choose venues that offer digital materials (e.g., virtual brochures) over paper, and that provide refillable water stations instead of single-use bottles.

Transport Considerations: Consider the environmental impact of the venue location. Select venues that are easily accessible by public transport, or provide options for carpooling or group transport to reduce the environmental impact of travel. For events requiring travel, Green Orbit Digital encourages the use of trains, buses, or shared transport options to reduce carbon emissions.

Green Initiatives: Venues should demonstrate a commitment to sustainability beyond certifications, such as using renewable energy sources, offering carbon offset programs, and implementing energy-efficient solutions.

1. Booking Process

To ensure consistency and compliance with these guidelines, the booking process for venues and hospitality should follow these steps:

1. Determine the Event’s Purpose and Budget:
Clearly define the purpose of the event or meeting (e.g., internal meeting, client presentation, team-building activity) and set a reasonable budget for the venue and hospitality.

1. Select Sustainable Venues:
Research venues that are both suitable for the event and comply with Green Orbit Digital's sustainability criteria. A list of preferred venues with sustainability certifications should be maintained for reference.

1. Obtain Quotes and Proposals:
Gather proposals from multiple venues and hospitality providers to compare pricing, services, and sustainability credentials. Ensure the proposals include a breakdown of all costs (venue rental, catering, additional services, etc.).

1. Seek Approval:
Obtain approval for the chosen venue and hospitality provider from the relevant manager or budget holder. Ensure the total cost, including all ancillary charges, is within the approved budget.

1. Confirm Booking and Payment Details:
Once approved, confirm the booking with the venue or hospitality provider and ensure all details (event schedule, catering requirements, audio-visual needs, etc.) are clearly outlined. Secure payment arrangements, whether through a purchase order or direct payment, depending on the vendor.

1. Consider Accessibility:
Ensure that the venue is accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities. Consider factors such as wheelchair access, proximity to public transport, and any specific needs related to the event’s attendees.

1. Post-Event Evaluation:
After the event, gather feedback from attendees and review the venue’s sustainability performance. This will help inform future venue selections and ensure continuous improvement in sustainable practices.

1. Additional Considerations

Dietary Requirements: Ensure that catering provisions cater to the dietary preferences and needs of all attendees (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, halal, kosher). This should be considered when booking venues or catering services.

Cancellation Policy: Always confirm the venue’s cancellation policy before booking. Ensure the terms are clear, including any charges for last-minute cancellations or changes to the booking.

Insurance: Ensure that the venue provides appropriate insurance coverage for the event, particularly if it involves external attendees or activities with potential risk.

1. Conclusion

Green Orbit Digital strives to balance the needs of business and sustainability when booking venues and hospitality services. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our event planning and hospitality practices align with the company’s core values, minimise environmental impact, and stay within budgetary constraints.
