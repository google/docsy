## Customer outcomes we are driving for at GitLab

As a developer it is imperative to know if you are introducing vulnerabilities as you merge into protected branches in addition to the default branch. In FY25, we will allow users to track vulnerabilities across multiple branches. If there is something a developer wants to remediate, but aren't sure where to get started, they can use our features AI to learn more and get a suggestion for a fix.

As a security engineer, you want to know what vulnerabilities to work on first. Over the next year we will be adding key risk metrics so you can quickly triage and mitigate vulnerabilities that have the potential to be exploited.

Leadership wants to make sure their organization is mitigating risks and their security programs are effective. With enhancements to the Security Dashboards, leaders will have a place to get an overview and answer key questions about metrics, trends and vulnerabilities that need
to be addressed quickly.

## Top Priorities for FY25

**Enable users to identify risk and visualize trends** - We will be making enhancements to Security Dashboards at the project and group level.

**Estimate potential impact and likelihood of vulnerability exploitation** - Give users the ability to access risk directly in the vulnerability report through industry known risk scores like CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) and exploitability probability.

**Enable users to track vulnerabilities across multiple branches** - Allow users to track vulnerabilities outside the default branch.

**Offer guidance for users to get started with vulnerability remediation** - leverage the power of AI and security training to help developers understand and remediate vulnerabilities.

**Security Insights features are reliable and perform at scale** - As we add more group and organization level features, we will be optimizing query performance and move forward with confidence that our database will scale and perform as we grow.

## Security Insights Team Structure

The Security Insights group is structured into three focused swimlanes that each approach work in [vertical slices](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/user-story-splitting-vertical-slice-vs-horizontal-slice/): Performance and Optimization, Projects, and AI. This subdivision is to provided bounded focus to each area: enabling us to progress on multiple fronts and reduce planning overhead.

### Team Structure

{{% team-by-manager-slug manager="nmccorrison" team="Engineer(.*)Security Risk Management:Security Insights" %}}

## Common Links

* Slack channels:
  * Main channel: [`#g_srm_security_insights`](hhttps://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07UD442PQ9)
  * Engineering - All SRM groups: [`#s_srm_eng`](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05N5BLDYUT)

### Prioritization

We use our  Security Insights Priorities page for [17.x](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/security_risk_management/security-insights/17_security_insights_priorities.html) to track what we are doing, and what order to do it in.

### Product Workflow

The Security Insights group largely follows GitLab's [Product Development Flow](/handbook/product-development/product-development-flow/).

Additional information can be found on the [Planning page](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/security-risk-management/srm-planning/).

### Milestone Planning

* On the second Tuesday of the month the Product Manager kicks off the planning issue. They identify priorities for the milestone and tag engineering managers, and stable counterparts (UX, QA) to review.
* By the third Tuesday of the month the Engineering Managers have reviewed the planning issue and agreed on the scope for the milestone.
  * All issues scheduled for the milestone should have the `~Deliverable` label as well as `Health Status: On Track` at the beginning of the milestone. The milestone field should also be set correctly.
* The planning issue is created in this [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/12683) for 17.0-17.11.

### Tracking Deliverables

* Issues that are marked as Deliverables for a milestone serve as the single source of truth for what we aimed to deliver for a given milestone. Throughout the milestone, things may change, become blocked, etc. *Ideally, we'd like to keep the Planning Issue unchanged after the milestone starts.*
* Something is considered delivered if it is either a. merged into production in time for the release date, b. completed before the next milestone start, or c. the feature flag enabling the feature is turned on.  It is important to keep track of the milestone of the deliverable; we encourage self-managed customers to turn on feature flags so they can try different features. Ensuring the milestone is correct, allows someone to tell if that change is available in a specific release.

#### Weekly async issue updates

At the end of every week, each engineer is expected to provide a quick async issue update by commenting on their assigned issues using the following template:

```markdown
### Async issue update

* Current status:
<!--- Please provide a quick summary of the current status (one sentence) -->

* Shipping this milestone: <!-- Not confident | Slightly confident | Very confident -->

* Scope reduction opportunities: <!-- No | Yes, ... -->

/health_status <!-- on_track | needs_attention | at_risk -->
/label <!-- ~"workflow::blocked" | ~"workflow::refinement" | ~"workflow::ready for development" | ~"workflow::In dev" | ~"workflow::In review" | ~"workflow::verification" -->

<!-- Please apply a :triangular_flag_on_post: emoji to this comment. Fore more information see https://gitlab.com/jayswain/automated-reporting -->
```

We do this to encourage our team to be more async in collaboration and to allow the community and other team members to know the progress of issues that we are actively working on. This also enables us to automatically collate updates across swimlanes, removing some manual process.

#### Indicating Status and Raising Risk

Our teams use the [Health Status](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#health-status) feature within issues to indicate the likelihood of completion within the milestone. We assign `On Track` at the beginning of a milestone to a small number of issues where we have high confidence in delivery during that milestone. If there is concern with marking something as initially on track, then we should discuss why.

Raising risk early is important. The more time we have, the more options we have. For example, issues that have not gone into review by the first Monday of the month may not have enough time to get merged. These should be considered Needs Attention or At Risk depending on their complexity and other factors.

Follow these steps when raising or downgrading risk:

1. Update the Health Status in the issue:
    1. `On Track` - high confidence - there is no indication the work won't get merged by the second Tuesday of the month.
    1. `Needs Attention` - medium confidence - the issue is blocked or has other factors that need to be discussed.
    1. `At Risk` - low confidence - the issue is in jeopardy of missing the merge cutoff on the second Tuesday of the month.
1. Add a comment about why the risk has increased or decreased. Copy the Engineering Manager and Project Manager for awareness.

Note that an issue probably shouldn't go directly from On Track to At Risk. That pattern indicates we have missed an opportunity to discuss earlier. Consider the progression: `On Track -> Needs Attention -> At Risk`.

### Support rotation

On top of our development roadmap, engineering teams need to perform tasks related to support and triage. Our team nominates an individual person to reserve capacity for these tasks. The rota is [here (internal link)](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/govern/threat-insights/-/epics/2) This is to avoid excessive context-switching and better distribute the workload. It is important we defend our focus within the team to support the delivery of our commitments.

If you are **not** the nominated person in a given week then:

1. You are not expected to triage and investigate by default. Use your best judgement here (e.g. critical issues still take priority, no change in expectations here).
1. You should redirect the question to the nominated person (e.g. if it comes in a DM in Slack, redirect it to our public channel).

Please keep track of the actions you're doing during your rotation and add notes in the corresponding issue (e.g. copying tools command executed locally, sharing relevant changes to projects and processes, etc.)

#### Triage expectations

Triage does not immediately guarantee a change to currently-planned work in a milestone. Triage is the process of determining impact and priority so we can justify changes to scope and milestone commitments.

* Refine the request for help tickets: do we have reproduction steps, does this relate to other scoped or planned work, is this a bug or feature request or an acceptable limitation of the system.
  * Outcomes could be: updates to our documentation or Handbook pages, validated reproduction of bugs and then creating issues from this.
* Directly answering support questions.
* Engaging with Product to agree on priority and scheduling of any work required. Work with Product to define severity and whether to interrupt the rest of the development team.

When dealing with Slack interactions you are expected to use the following reactions:

* :eyes: - I am actively looking at this
* :white_check_mark: (or a variant) - This is resolved

#### Responsibilities - Support

1. Monitor slack channels for questions, support requests, and alerts. The person assigned to the reaction rotation is expected to handle them primarily.
If a support engineer requests assistance via Slack and it requires investigation or debugging, they should be directed to raise an issue in [a dedicated project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sec-sub-department/section-sec-request-for-help).

* [#g_srm_security_insights](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07UD442PQ9)
* [s_srm](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07QUBQ98S1)
* [#sec-section](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02087FTL5V)

We utilize a standardized [Request for Help](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/request-for-help) process to request formal assistance from our group . This helps with visibility, tracking and review. Please submit a new Request for Help for Security Insights using [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/request-for-help/-/issues/new?issuable_template=SupportRequestTemplate-Security-Insights).

### MR Reviews

We follow these guidelines when submitting MRs for review when the change is within the Security Insights domain:

1. Aim to request at least one of the reviews from someone outside our group. This helps avoid a code knowledge silo.
1. For time-critical reviews, consider using internal reviewers and maintainers.
1. The initial review should be performed by a member of the team. This helps the team by:
   * Faster reviews, as the reviewer is already familiar with the domain.
   * Additional awareness of changes taking place within the domain.
   * Identifying changes that don't align with what is happening with the domain.
   * Providing additional confidence from a domain expert to the external maintainer reviewer that the change behaves as expected.
1. GraphQL merge requests should be reviewed by a frontend engineer as soon as possible. This
   helps to validate the interface, and allows changes to be made before tests are written.

### Issue Boards

* [Security Insights Milestone Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1754666?milestone_title=Started&label_name[]=group%3A%3Asecurity%20insights)

## Quality

## Quality and E2E Specs

### Workflow of E2E runs on Staging and Production

We run scheduled E2E tests on both staging and production environments every 4 hours. These tests help ensure that recent deployments haven’t introduced regressions.

We can monitor test results in the following Slack channels:

* #e2e-run-staging
* #e2e-run-production

### Running and Fixing E2E specs

#### Prerequisites

Ensure the following before running tests:

* `gdk` is up and running
* Runner is up and running
* Set `GITLAB_SIMULATE_SAAS` to 0 inside your `env.runit` in the `gitlab-development-kit` directory:

  ```shell
  export GITLAB_SIMULATE_SAAS=0
  ```

* Ensure EE License is set as an environment variable.

#### Running QA Tests

Use the following command to run tests locally against your GDK instance:

#### Running against your `gdk`

* With a feature flag enabled:

  ```shell
  WEBDRIVER_HEADLESS=false bundle exec bin/qa Test::Instance::All http://gdk.test:3000/ <filename/path> --enable-feature <feature_flag_name>
  ```

You can also run a specific RSpec line using <filename>:<line_number> to target the surrounding example block. See [RSpec best practices](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/testing_guide/best_practices/#rspec) for more details.

* With a feature flag disabled:

  ```shell
  WEBDRIVER_HEADLESS=false bundle exec bin/qa Test::Instance::All http://gdk.test:3000/ <filename/path> --disable-feature <feature_flag_name>
  ```

* Without a feature flag:

  ```shell
  WEBDRIVER_HEADLESS=false GITLAB_ADMIN_PASSWORD="root_password" GITLAB_QA_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN="api_token_from_gdk" GITLAB_PASSWORD="root_password" QA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG QA_GITLAB_URL=http://gdk.test:3000 bundle exec rspec <filename/path>
  ```

#### Running against staging

```shell
GITLAB_QA_USER_AGENT=<USER_AGENT> GITLAB_ADMIN_USERNAME=<ADMIN_USERNAME>  GITLAB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<ADMIN_PASSWORD>
GITLAB_USERNAME=<USERNAME> GITLAB_QA_ACCESS_TOKEN=<ACCESS_TOKEN> GITLAB_PASSWORD=<GITLAB_PASSWORD> QA_DEBUG=true WEBDRIVER_HEADLESS=true bundle exec bin/qa Test::Instance::All https://staging.gitlab.com <filename/path>
```

The credentials are to be found in 1Password.

#### Local testing of licensed features

When a feature needs to check the current license tier, it's important to make sure this also works on GitLab.com.

To emulate this locally, follow these steps:

1. Export an environment variable[^1]:

   ```shell
   export GITLAB_SIMULATE_SAAS=1
   ```

1. Within the same shell session, run:

   ```shell
   gdk restart
   ```

1. Navigate to **Admin > Settings > General > "Account and limit"**, and enable "Allow use of licensed EE features".

See the [related handbook entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/ee_features.html#act-as-saas) for more details.

### Troubleshooting common errors and fixes

* **Error: QA::Resource::Sandbox Fabrication Failed**
  * Error Message:

    ```plaintext
    Fabrication of QA::Resource::Sandbox using the API failed (400) with `{ "message": "Failed to save group {:visibility_level=[\"public has been restricted by your GitLab administrator\"]}" }`
    ```

  * Solution:
    * Navigate to GDK Admin Area → General
    * Under Restricted Visibility Levels, ensure none of the checkboxes are selected.

* **Error: API Client Validation Failed**
  * Error message:

    ```plaintext
    An error occurred in a `before(:suite)` hook.
    Failure/Error: raise InvalidTokenError, "API client validation failed! Code: #{resp.code}, Err: '#{resp.body}'"
    ```

  * Solution:
    * Ensure your user verification is complete before running a pipeline.
    * Check if your API token is valid.

* **Error: Namespace is Not Valid**
  * Error message:

    ```plaintext
    QA::Resource::Errors::ResourceFabricationFailedError:
    Fabrication of QA::Resource::Project using the API failed (400) with `{ "message": { "namespace": ["is not valid"] } }`.
    ```

  * Solution:
    * Reset your GDK by running:

      ```shell
      gdk data-reset
      ```

### Running E2E specs in the MR pipeline

We encourage running the `e2e: test-on-omnibus` downstream [E2E job](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/end_to_end/#testing-code-in-merge-requests) in merge requests at least once and reviewing the results when there are changes in:

* GraphQL (API response, query parameters, schema, etc.)
* Gemfile (version changes, adding/removing gems)
* Database schema/query changes
* Any frontend changes that directly impact the vulnerability report page, MR security widget, pipeline security tab, security policies, configuration, or license compliance page.

### Running Govern E2E specs locally against GDK

Standalone [E2E specs can be run against your local GDK instance](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/qa?ref_type=heads#generic-command-for-a-typical-gdk-installation).

### E2E tests with feature flags

E2E tests should pass with a feature flag enabled before it is enabled on Staging or on GitLab.com.
Therefore, it's important to confirm this when introducing a new feature flag. Adding or editing a feature flag definition file [starts two `e2e:test-on-omnibus` jobs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/end_to_end/feature_flags.html#automatic-test-execution-when-a-feature-flag-definition-changes) (one with the feature flag turned on and another where it's turned off).

For a thorough explanation of the end-to-end testing process when working with feature flags, please consult the official documentation on the [Testing feature flags with end-to-end tests](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/testing_guide/end_to_end/feature_flag_testing/#e2e-flow-when-changing-a-feature-flag-with-a-merge-request) page.

## Contributing

### Local testing of licensed features

When a feature needs to check the current license tier, it's important to make sure this also works on GitLab.com.

To emulate this locally, follow these steps:

1. Export an environment variable: `export GITLAB_SIMULATE_SAAS=1`
   * There are many ways to pass an environment variable to your local GitLab instance. For example, you can create a `env.runit` file in the root of your GDK with the above snippet.
1. Within the same shell session run `gdk restart`
1. Admin > Settings > General > "Account and limit", enable "Allow use of licensed EE features"

See the [related handbook entry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/ee_features.html#act-as-saas) for more details.

### Cross-stack collaboration

We encourage frontend engineers to contribute to the backend and vice versa. In such cases we should work closely with a domain expert from within our group
and also keep the initial review internal.

This will help ensure that the changes follow best practice, are well tested, have no unintended side effects, and help the team be across any changes that go into the Security Insights codebase.

### Community Contributions

The Security Insights group welcomes community contributions. Any community contribution should get prompt feedback from one of the Security Insights engineers. All engineers on the team are responsible for working with community contributions. If a team member does not have time to review a community contribution, please tag the Engineering Manager, so that they can assign the community contribution to another team member.

If a team member creates an issue or finds an issue where we would be open to a community contribution, it should be labeled with ~"Seeking community contributions". If the contributor needs an EE license, we can point towards the [Contributing to the GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE)](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/contributor-success/community-contributors-workflows/#contributing-to-the-gitlab-enterprise-edition-ee) section on the Community contributors workflows page.

### Group discussion

We hold group discussions every other week.  We alternate between a milestone kickoff and general discussion format. Everyone is invited to attend, and it's a great forum to ask questions about Vulnerability Management, customer queries, our road map, and what the Security Insights team might be thinking about. You can find the meetings on the [Security Insights calendar](#common-links); take a look at [the agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnjYPNKtYzbpdEz16u0U2raDdLcIFY-0ibjxGLltyG0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.j80itk3qkjs3) (internal link). We hope to see you there!
