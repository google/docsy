## What is a Zendesk App

A Zendesk App is an application (written in HTML/CSS/JS) that runs in a location of Zendesk. What it does and how it does it varies greatly from application to application. Applications can be run in a great many places, but the traditional locations are:

- [Ticket sidebar](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/apps/apps-support-api/ticket_sidebar/)
- [User sidebar](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/apps/apps-support-api/user_sidebar/)
- [Organization sidebar](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/apps/apps-support-api/organization_sidebar/)
- [Navbar](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/apps/apps-support-api/nav_bar/)
- [Background](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/apps/apps-support-api/background/)

You can see more resources on application locations via the [Zendesk Developer Manifest Reference](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/manifest/#location) documentation.

Zendesk applications tend to come from one of two areas:

- [Zendesk Marketplace](https://www.zendesk.com/apps/)
- Developed in-house

### Unbabel

<sup>*Introduced via [support-team-meta#1664](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/issues/1664)*</sup>

Powered by state-of-the-art AI and a worldwide community of translators, Unbabel delivers translation at enterprise scale. We help you serve customers in any language, with fast, native-quality translations of your customer support tickets in Zendesk.

App information:

- Located in the ticket sidebar
- Restricted by Group:
  - Support AMER
  - Support APAC
  - Support EMEA
- This application was developed by Unbabel and is available in the [Zendesk Marketplace](https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/support/43875/unbabel-for-zendesk-support/).

#### Replying with a Translation

To request a translation automatically, simply reply as you normally would as an internal note with the #unbabel hashtag included at the top of your content.

Please also ensure that the `unbabel_en`, `unbabel_reply`, `unbabeled` tags are included, otherwise your response might not be translated automatically. Should this happen, you will need to add the missing tags, and create a new internal note with the #unbabel hashtag included at the top of your content.

Once you submit your response, it may take several seconds for Unbabel to automatically translate your internal comment, but it can take several minutes if a human is required to manually translate your internal comment. To view the status of the translation, you can open the Apps sidebar in the ticket, and scroll down to the **Unbabel for Zendesk Support** box.

After a translated response has been sent to the customer via Unbabel it is necessary to manually set the ticket status as **Pending** since Unbabel will incorrectly set the ticket status as **Open**. You must do this with an *empty comment* (remove any `#unbabel` added by the plugin, before you Submit as Pending).

#### Excluding Text from Translation

The highlighted code can be skipped for translation by adding 3 brackets around the text:

```string
<<< text/code >>>
```

The above can also be used to protect sensitive information from a human translator when sending a translation request.

#### Disabling Unbabel in a Specific Ticket

Sometimes Unbabel is triggered if a customer's signature was written in a language that requires translation but the customer replies in English, and the translation is not needed. In this case, there is a way to disable Unbabel in this specific ticket:

- Open the ticket in question.
- Click Apps > Unbabel for Zendesk Support.
- `Change` the `Customer language` to `English`.

From now on, Unbabel will not be triggered in this ticket.

#### Help with Translation

If for some reason you have difficulty in understanding the automated translation, an actual human intervention can actually be requested. Simply click the link `Can't understand the translation?` in the Unbabel app box and this will send your response for translation to Unbabel editors.

#### Best Practices for Unbabel

As indicated in the training session, please keep in mind of the following best practices when writing a response for translation.

- Respond in one language
  - It is likely that you can speak another language and understand what the customer is trying to say. Please ensure that you only use the English language when responding tickets as the system may not detect the language correctly.
- Copy only the body of the content that needs translation.
  - When referring to a quoted texts from our customers, please only use the content that requires translation. Including snippets/code/elements may take more time to translate and could result in a mistranslation.
- Mind the punctuation.
  - Punctuation can be sometimes tricky for Unbabel so please be sure there are no unnecessary periods/punctuations in between.
- Single Word Use
  - It is likely that the response you are sending may be lost in translation, for example the word `pass` would differ to a `boarding pass`.

## App development

{{< alert title=Note color=primary >}}

This is generalized information we have found helpful in the course of app development. It is not a single source of truth.

{{< /alert >}}

### Understanding Zendesk Apps

Before you can start creating and editing apps in Zendesk, it is important to understand the ins and outs of both Zendesk Apps and [Zendesk Apps framework](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/using-the-apps-framework/).

There is a lot to this, so the Zendesk documentation is the best resource you have to learn the various ins and outs. This training documentation will cover what is viewed at "the most important" parts, but it is highly recommended you read and reference the [Zendesk developer documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/getting_started/) as often as possible.

#### ZAT

ZAT, or Zendesk App Tools, is a ruby gem that makes working with Zendesk Apps locally considerably easier. It is highly recommended you install it on your computer:

```bash
gem install rake
gem install zendesk_apps_tools
```

To update it:

```bash
gem update rake
gem update zendesk_apps_tools
```

Sometimes on Mac terminal, you will get write permission error. You may use:

```bash
sudo gem update rake
sudo gem update zendesk_apps_tools
```

Note: ZAT is having issues with Ruby version `3.0.0 and plus`. You'll likely need to use old stable versions like `2.6.3p62`

#### manifest.json

This file is used to configure you application. As such, it is very important and vital it is accurate.

The common configuration settings are:

| Setting | What it does | Required? |
|---------|--------------|:---------:|
| name | Specifies the name of the app | Y |
| author | Specifies the author of the app | Y |
| version | Specifies the app version | Y |
| frameworkVersion | Specifies the framework version to use | Y |
| location | Specifies where the app appears | Y |
| defaultLocale | Specifies the locale of the app | Y |
| parameters | The parameters to pass to the app during installation | N |
| domainWhitelist  | The domains to allow use of secure parameters | N |
| private | Specifies whether the app can be only be installed in the app developer's account or not | N |

#### Location

This setting determines where the app will appear and run. This is a very important setting. The first setting determines the product type location, and within that setting you can specify many other configurations, including the physical location the app will appear in. For the product type location, we always use `support`.

The physical locations are as follows:

| String | Location/Purpose |
|--------|------------------|
| `ticket_sidebar` | The right side of all ticket view pages |
| `new_ticket_sidebar` | The right side of all new ticket pages |
| `ticket_editor` | A button on the ticket editor box |
| `nav_bar` | An icon on the left-side navigation bar |
| `top_bar` | An icon on the right side of the top menu |
| `user_sidebar` | The right side of all user view pages |
| `organization_sidebar` | The right side of all organization view pages |
| `background` | The app runs in the background and does not display anywhere |
| `modal` | Used when the app creates modals |

Within the physical location settings, you can include more configuration settings, with the most common being:

| String | What it does | Variable type |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| `autoHide` | Tells the app to auto-collapse on first load | Boolean |
| `autoLoad` | Tells the app to automaticall local (defaults to true) | Boolean |
| `signed` | Specifies whether or not to use signed URLs | Boolean |
| `url` | The URL of the page to display in the iframe of the app | String |
| `size` | The initial app size (configure this in the app instead) | JSON |

As an example, to have an app load "<https://google.com>" automatically in the ticket sidebar with a starting height of 200px, your configuration block would look like this:

```json
"location": {
  "support": {
    "ticket_sidebar": {
      "autoLoad": true,
      "url": "https://google.com/",
      "size": {
        "height": "200px"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As another example, to have your app load in both the user and organization pages, rendering the locale `assets/iframe.html` file, you would do this:

```json
"location": {
  "support": {
    "user_sidebar": "assets/iframe.html",
    "organization_sidebar": "assets/iframe.html",
  }
}
```

#### Parameters

This is where you would define variables you want the app to use during installation.

#### Domain whitelists

If your app is using secure parameters and you plan to make requests outside of Zendesk, you must whitelist the domains in question. Each parameter is a hash that contains the following:

- `name`: the name of the parameter
- `type`: the type of parameter
- `secure`: ensures users cannot see the variable value when making HTTP requests (you should *always* use this)
- `require`: specifies if the parameter is required for installation

As an example, to use two required parameters (`param1` and `param2`), both of which are text parameters in a secure way, you would do the following:

```json
"parameters": [
  {
    "name": "param1",
    "type": "text",
    "secure": true,
    "required": true
  },
  {
    "name": "param2",
    "type": "text",
    "secure": true,
    "required": true
  }
]
```

During the installation of the app, Zendesk will ask you to give the values for these parameters. To utilize this in the code of your app, you will use this:

`{{setting.NAME_OF_PARAMETER}}`

Where `NAME_OF_PARAMETER` is the name you gave the parameter in the manifest.json file.

#### init

To create a client instance of the ZAF (Zendesk App Framework) client, you need to ensure the following is present in the javascript of your app:

```javascript
var client = ZAFClient.init();
```

#### App resizing

To resize the app during runtime, you would use the `invoke` class, specifying you wish to invoke the `resize` function. This is done like so:

```javascript
// First line shown to clarify you use the ZAF client object to do this
var zafclient = ZAFClient.init();
zafclient.invoke('resize', { width: '100%', height: '100px' });
```

### Required javascript library

To utilize the ZAT, you must include the following javascript in your app's HTML file(s):

```html
<script src="https://static.zdassets.com/zendesk_app_framework_sdk/2.0/zaf_sdk.min.js"></script>
```

#### Getting metadata

To get metadata and use it in your app, you need to use the ZAF client's `get` function. This takes an array of values to get from the ticket metadata, which you use in a function.

As an example, to get the ticket requester's name and the ticket's organization, and then log them to the console, you would do the following:

```javascript
// First line shown to clarify you use the ZAF client object to do this
var zafclient = ZAFClient.init();
zafclient.get(['ticket.requester.name', 'ticket.organization']).then(function(data) {
  console.log("Ticket requester name: " + data['ticket.requester.name']);
  console.log("Ticket organization: " + data['ticket.organization']);
});
```

As another example, to get the ticket's due date and the due date notes (a custom ticket field) and then log them to the console, you would do the following:

```javascript
// First line shown to clarify you use the ZAF client object to do this
var zafclient = ZAFClient.init();
zafclient.get(['ticket.customField:due_date', 'ticket.customField:custom_field_360017383799']).then(function(data) {
  console.log("Due date": + data['ticket.customField:due_date']);
  console.log("Due date notes:" + data['ticket.customField:custom_field_360017383799']);
});
```

#### Making requests

Your app might need to make requests, whether they be "internal" (i.e. within Zendesk itself) or external. To do this, we use the `request` function of the client object.

The format of this is *very* close to that of making [AJAX requests](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) in jQuery. The format you will normally use is:

```javascript
// First line shown to clarify you use the ZAF client object to do this
var zafclient = ZAFClient.init();
zafclient.request({
  method: 'REQUEST_TYPE',
  url: 'URL_TO_USE',
  contentType: 'CONTENT_MEDIA_TO_SEND',
  data: DATA_OBJECT,
  secure: BOOLEAN,
  headers: HEADERS_OBJECT
}).then(function(data) {
  // do stuff
});
```

The exact parameters in the request will vary from request to request.

As an example, if you wanted to update the due date of a ticket, you might do:

```javascript
// First line shown to clarify you use the ZAF client object to do this
var zafclient = ZAFClient.init();
zafclient.request({
  method: 'PUT',
  url: '/api/v2/tickets/123456.json',
  contentType: 'application/json',
  data: JSON.stringify({
    due_at: new Date('2021-01-01').toISOString()
  }),
  secure: BOOLEAN,
  headers: HEADERS_OBJECT
}).then(function(data) {
  console.log('Due date updated to 2021-01-01');
});
```

As another example, if you wanted to make a GET request to gitlab.com to find information about user ID 987654, using a secure parameter from app installation, you might do:

```javascript
// First line shown to clarify you use the ZAF client object to do this
var zafclient = ZAFClient.init();
zafclient.request({
  method: "GET",
  url: 'https://gitlab.com/api/v4/users/987654?private_token={{setting.GitLab_token}}',
  secure: true
}).then(function(data) {
  console.log('User email: ' + data.email);
});
```

### Testing an app

There are two ways to test a Zendesk app before you put it into production:

#### Locally

{{< alert title=Note color=primary >}}

This cannot be done if your app is using secure parameters. Instead, you would need to install the app into the Sandbox and test from there.

{{< /alert >}}

To test your app locally, cd into the app directory on your local computer and then run the `zat server` command. This will start up a ZAT server on your computer. Once it has booted up, go to a Zendesk URL and put `?zat=true` at the end. This will now load the apps from your local computer, allowing you to test out the app locally.

#### Via the Sandbox

If your app is using secure parameters, you will need to test via the Sandbox instead.
