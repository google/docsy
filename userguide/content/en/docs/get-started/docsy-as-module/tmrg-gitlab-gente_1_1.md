## Purpose of the TMRG

The GitLab's Gente TMRG provides a safe space for every GitLab Team member within GitLab to raise awareness and celebrate Latin American culture, and to understand how the diversity of this region can be leveraged to contribute to GitLab's strategic objectives. This group is not exclusionary and is open to anyone who is a GitLab employee and interested in learning more about Latin culture.

## Mission

To promote advancement, cultural awareness, talent recruitment, retention, and professional development for Latinx individuals by giving a voice to the diverse backgrounds of the Latinx community in order to ensure the GitLab messaging continues to reflect its core values of Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging.
