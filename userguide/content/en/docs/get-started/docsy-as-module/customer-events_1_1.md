### Requesting a Reference Customer

Requesting a Reference Customer to speak and/or otherwise support an event
The customer reference team supports an average of 12 customer requests per quarter; we prioritize speaking requests from teams that directly support demand generation activities (field marketing/campaigns/alliances/partner and corporate teams).

We can support the following customer speaker requests as a minimum commitment each quarter; beyond that we will need exceptional management review. Once a customer speaker request issue is raised, the CRM will link it to the appropriate tracking issue below.

### Customer Speaker Management

Tracking issues are in this [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1187) and the CRM will assign to the issue. Once the minimum commit number has been reached we will advise the team leads.

We will send this deck to customers once they agree to present to review as an example of the promotional options available.

Field Marketing (4 per qtr)
Campaigns (2 per qtr)
Alliances/ Partners (1 per qtr)

To request a reference customer to speak and/or otherwise support an event the first step is to [open the Customer Speaker Request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/product-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=customer-speaker-request) a minimum of 75 days before the event. This issue will be tracked on the Customer Reference Program [board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/boards/927283?label_name[]=Customer%20Reference%20Program). As customer references need to be effectively optimised we suggest a maximum of two customer speakers at events.

*Please note that requests that fall without the timing parameters outlined in the handbook may not be supported, and if weâ€™re supporting past the mininum requirement, we will require additional approvals to support the request*

**Process for fulfilling a request to support a Field Marketing, Corporate Marketing/Company, or Community Event**

   Please note if the customer needs to approve and collaborate on a marketing plan; we require 90 days notice as we will need to work with the customer's
marketing team etc.
1. CRM will load the request into Reference Edge for tracking purposes.
1. CRM will pull a SFDC report of customers in billing city/state/area to view an applicable pool of speakers, as well as a report in Reference Edge.

From there all communication on the logistics will take place in the main event issue and any content communication will take place in the PMM support issue, listed below.
1. When a reference customer agree to present; the CRM should open an [SM Request issue for content and delivery support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/product-marketing/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/A-SM-Support-Request.md) with the PMM team to assist in content development and/or review and when helpful, public speaking skill development.

If an on-demand offer is created for the recorded session the CRM will update the on-demand campaign ID (usually has prefix PF for Pathfactory) with the Reference ID also.

### Customer Event Presentation Process

**Process to engage with the customer once agreement for presenting at an event is secured**

1. Customer Reference Manager (CRM) sends the customer an email (cc'ing the Event Manager as well) to request their professional photo/bio/abstract details and shares an outline for creating their success story in their corporate template.  The proposed format:

   - Landscape before GitLab: Describe the challenges/business pains experienced with CI/CD and DevOps before adopting GitLab. What problems did the customer set out to solve?
   - Why GitLab: Explain customer's reasoning for selecting GitLab. Who else was considered and/or why did we stand out?
   - Results after implementing GitLab: Talk about the positive results with GitLab at a high level. This helps set the stage for more detailed, specific metrics / numbers that validate the results in the slide that comes next.
   - Key benefits and Metrics from GitLab (align with value drivers/ use cases etc)
   - Future Plans with GitLab

   The above format is a proposed flow for the customer only; we welcome customers adding additional details (screenshots/graphic/images etc) to their presentation that reflects their success story to really make it their own. The CRM will work with the PMM to support the customer with messaging and content as required.

1. The Event Manager supported by the CRM coordinates a maximum of 3 planning calls (including a dry run) with the customer to be respectful of everyone's time. The Event Manager schedules the planning and dry run calls in the calendars of all relevant parties as soon as feasible.

   - The Event Managers act as the DRI to facilitate these calls, set the agenda, ensure the process goes smoothly, and to develop/finalize content.
   - The CRM is the DRI for customer sourcing only, not the overall event.
   - The CRM will support content creation development by proposing the flow listed above, if requested by the customer.
   - The CRM also helps coordinate between the customer and GitLab team members collaborating on the content.
   - The CRM is optional to attend the dry run and the actual event as by then the customer content requirement has been delivered.
