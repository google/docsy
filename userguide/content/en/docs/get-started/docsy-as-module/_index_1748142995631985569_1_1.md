## GitLab Support's Enhanced Support Offerings Handbook Pages

Enhanced Support Offerings are paid support services sold as add-ons to Priority
Support. Right now we have only one such offering, `Assigned Support Engineer
(ASE)`. We expect that as we discover more of what our customers need we will
develop more Enhanced Support Offerings to meet those needs.

For the most up-to-date information, see the
[Enhanced Support Offerings page](https://about.gitlab.com/support/enhanced-support-offerings/)
of our Support website.

In this section of the Support Handbook, we devote a separate sub-section to
each unique offering. In each of those, we intend to capture all the information
that Team Members in Support, Sales, Professional Services and Customer Success
might need in order to be part of, or work with, the Enhanced Support Offerings
Team.

## Offering: Assigned Support Engineer

Customers with Priority Support (GitLab Premium and Ultimate subscriptions)
may choose to add an Assigned Support Engineer (ASE) to their contract. See our
[Assigned Support Engineer page](offering-assigned-support-engineer/) for
details of this offering as well as information about becoming and being an
Assigned Support Engineer.
