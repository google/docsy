### Running Nextjs in production mode

There are some key differences between `next start` and running the standalone version:

1. **Dependency Requirements**:

   - `next start`: Requires all project dependencies to be installed (`node_modules` folder) and needs the Next.js framework to be present
   - Standalone: Creates a standalone server that bundles all necessary dependencies, making it self-contained without needing `node_modules`

2. **Deployment Size**:

   - `next start`: Smaller initial build size since it relies on shared dependencies
   - Standalone: Larger build size since it includes all necessary dependencies bundled together

3. **Portability**:

   - `next start`: Less portable since you need to ensure all dependencies are properly installed in the deployment environment
   - Standalone: More portable since it's self-contained and can run anywhere with just Node.js installed

4. **Production Environment**:
   - `next start`: Better suited for environments where you have control over the dependency management and can ensure consistent installations
   - Standalone: Better for containerized deployments or environments where you want to minimize external dependencies

If you're deploying in a containerized environment or want maximum portability, the standalone version would be preferable. If you're deploying in a traditional environment where you have control over dependencies, `next start` might be more suitable.

Note: If you need more specific details about how these are configured in your project, you might want to try agent mode to look at the actual package.json scripts and server.js implementation.
