# Scripts Directory

Organised by language for clarity:

- **bash/** — Shell scripts for automation and system tasks.
- **python/** — Python utilities and data processing scripts.
- **nodejs/** — JavaScript/Node.js scripts for build and dev workflows.

Each folder may contain its own README with language-specific setup instructions.
