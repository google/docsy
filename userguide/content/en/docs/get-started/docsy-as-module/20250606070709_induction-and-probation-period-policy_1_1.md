1. Introduction

At Green Orbit Digital, we believe that a comprehensive induction process and a structured probation period are essential for integrating new employees into our organization and ensuring that they have the necessary support and guidance to succeed in their roles. This policy outlines our approach to induction and probation periods for all new employees.

2. Induction Process

- Purpose: The induction process aims to familiarize new employees with our organization, culture, policies, procedures, and expectations. It provides an opportunity for new employees to understand their role within the company and to begin building relationships with colleagues.

- Responsibility: The Human Resources (HR) department is responsible for coordinating and overseeing the induction process. Hiring managers and team leaders are responsible for providing on-the-job training and support during the induction period.

- Content: The induction program will cover topics such as:

- Duration: The duration of the induction period may vary depending on the complexity of the role and the individual's level of experience. Typically, the induction process will last for [insert duration], with ongoing support provided as needed.

3. Probation Period

- Purpose: The probation period provides both the employee and the company with an opportunity to assess suitability and performance in the role. It allows new employees to demonstrate their capabilities and adapt to the role and company culture, while also giving the company an opportunity to evaluate the employee's performance and fit within the organization.

- Duration: The probation period for new employees will be [insert duration], starting from the employee's date of commencement. This period may be extended in certain circumstances, at the discretion of the company.

- Performance Evaluation: Throughout the probation period, regular performance reviews will be conducted to assess the employee's progress and performance against agreed-upon objectives and expectations. These reviews will provide constructive feedback and support for the employee's development.

- Support and Training: During the probation period, new employees will receive ongoing support and training to help them succeed in their roles. This may include additional training sessions, mentorship opportunities, and regular check-ins with their line manager or HR representative.

- Termination: If performance concerns arise during the probation period, the company reserves the right to terminate the employment contract with notice or payment in lieu of notice, in accordance with company policies and legal requirements.

4. Completion of Probation

- Successful Completion: Upon successful completion of the probation period, the employee will be confirmed in their role, and their employment status will be updated accordingly. They will be eligible for all benefits and entitlements available to permanent employees.

- Review Meeting: A final review meeting will be conducted at the end of the probation period to discuss the employee's performance, confirm their confirmation in the role, and outline any areas for further development or support.

5. Policy Review

This Induction and Probation Period Policy will be reviewed regularly to ensure that it remains relevant and effective. Any updates or amendments to the policy will be communicated to all employees in a timely manner.

6. Contact Information

For any questions or clarification regarding this policy, employees should contact the HR department.

This policy is effective as of [insert date] and applies to all new employees joining Green Orbit Digital from this date onwards.
