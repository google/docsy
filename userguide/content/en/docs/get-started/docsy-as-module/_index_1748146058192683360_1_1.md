title: Lumos Access Request Guide
---

## Overview

You can request access to applications by creating an access request in the Lumos UI.

Lumos will automatically notify and get approval from your manager, system owner, and any other approvals needed.

If provisioning automation exists, Lumos will perform the app provisioning automatically. If not, Lumos will notify the system owner to perform the manual provisioning steps and will report back when the system owner has confirmed provisioning is complete.

We are migrating tech stack applications to Lumos iteratively and not all apps are available yet. We are prioritizing applications based on provisioning automation capabilities and those with higher volume of access requests.

## Create an Access Request

1. Open Lumos from the Okta tile or in the Slack sidebar
2. Select the app from the list
3. Select the following options:

    - Who the access is for
    - Permission needed
    - Access length
    - Business justification â€” "why" the access is needed

4. When all approvals are completed, Lumos will notify you that access is granted

## Approve an Access Request

1. Open the message that was received in Slack or Email, or visit Lumos from the Okta tile
2. If in Slack, simply click Approve, add comments, or Deny the request
3. Or from the email, click **View Request on Lumos** and Approve, add comments, or Deny the request

## Provision an app

**Note:** For apps with manual provisioning, the app admin will be requested to confirm the provisioning was performed

1. Open the message that was received in Slack or Email, or visit Lumos from the Okta tile
2. Perform the user creation within the app's admin interface
3. Return to Lumos and confirm that the user has been created

## Request an app is added to the Lumos App Store

- Any app with an Okta login can be added to Lumos. The best candidates have role-based access permissions controlled by Okta groups. [Open an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=lumos_appstore_add_app) to be scheduled for a future iteration.
