Several of the systems we manage are made by third-parties. Sometimes, we encounter issues specific to these the third-party applications that cannot be fully resolved by internally. In such scenarios, the Customer Support Operations team will need to contact the application's support system.

## Process

1. The agent or a Customer Support Operations team member will create an issue in the [Support Ops Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/support-ops-project).
1. A Customer Support Operations team member will act as the DRI.
1. The DRI will then triage and investigate the issue at hand, which may include collecting items such as HAR files, Browser versions, and plugins.
1. The DRI will open a ticket with the third-party app's support system, providing detailed information.
   - Always make sure to CC other Customer Support Operations team members
1. The DRI will update all the responses received from the third-party app's support team in the issue till the issue is fixed.
