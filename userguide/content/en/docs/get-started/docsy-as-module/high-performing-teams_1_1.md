[This transcript of an interview](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-love-criticism-adam-grant/) can help bring a new perspective for how to contextualize feedback.
1. There is a tendency in the talent assessment process to focus on how to eliminate your areas of opportunity and continue to build on your strengths; while that is certainly a great focus it can also be helpful to think about the limits of that model.

### Using career ladders

1. GitLab has established a standardized set of expectations for folks in each level via the [Job Framework](/handbook/company/structure/#job-frameworks). Some departments like Engineering have articulated [career frameworks](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/careers/matrix/development/) which enumerate functional competencies expected of those within those departments. The key thing to know about these tools is they enumerate expected behaviors of folks in the roles, and it can be helpful to see how other companies articulate these ideas. [Progression.fyi](http://www.progression.fyi/) is a helpful site for understanding these tools as it provides a collection of career ladders published by various organizations.
