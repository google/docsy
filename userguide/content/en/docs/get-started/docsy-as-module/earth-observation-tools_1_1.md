ESRI/ArcGis

Esri is the global market leader in geographic information system (GIS) software, location intelligence, and mapping.
Since 1969, we have supported customers with geographic science and geospatial analytics, what we call The Science of Where.
We take a geographic approach to problem-solving, brought to life by modern, enterprise-grade GIS technology. We are committed to using science and technology to build a sustainable world.

WHAT IS GIS?Geographic Information System (GIS)The mapping and data analysis technology that’s powering business decisions, supporting government operations, and quietly changing the world.

To make sense of the immense amount of data in today's world, we can map it.

When we visualize and analyze data on a map, hidden connections and insights emerge.

GIS gives us a deeper understanding of our world, guiding decisions and actions.

GIS is a unique problem-solving technology with remarkable impact. Play the video to learn from visionary leaders and technology professionals as they describe in their own words what GIS is, how it works, and why it matters.

FORMAL DEFINITIONGeographic information system(s), GIS (noun)GIS is a technology that is used to create, manage, analyze, and map all types of data.
GIS connects data to a map, integrating location data (where things are) with all types of descriptive information (what things are like there). This provides a foundation for mapping and analysis that is used in science and almost every industry. GIS helps users understand patterns, relationships, and geographic context. The benefits include improved communication, efficiency, management, and decision-making.
What does GIS do?While mapping is fundamental, GIS does much more.
Data managementGIS is a foundational system of record. You can store and integrate information from business systems and authoritative sources, magnifying data’s usefulness.
Mapping and visualizationFrom digital maps and dashboards to satellite imagery, 3D, and real time—GIS brings data to life, helping us understand problems and solve them. 
Spatial analysisMost data has a location component—everything happens somewhere. With spatial analysis tools, we find hidden relationships and generate new insights from data.
CommunicationMaps and dashboards communicate complex ideas quickly. Science and data build common understanding, supporting collaboration and problem-solving. 
How is GIS used?GIS is embedded in the daily operations of virtually every industry. The following are just a few of the thousands of applications.
Choosing the right location
Make better decisions about business growth or service expansion. Know where your best customers are and discover where to find more of them. 
When selecting the ideal place for a new retail store, distribution hub, or fire station, GIS can bring together all the information important to your decision. Consider what’s nearby, travel times, population numbers, local demographics, site suitability, and competitor locations.



GIS is now more important than everThe greatest challenges we face are inseparable from their geography. With GIS technology, we can unravel complex issues such as climate change, sustainability, and social inequity—and discover where to take action.
To create the future we all want to see, we will need GIS.
