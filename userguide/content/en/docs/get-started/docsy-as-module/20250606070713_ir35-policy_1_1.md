This policy sets out Green Orbit Digital’s approach to complying with the Off-Payroll Working Rules, commonly known as IR35, as defined by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The objective is to ensure that any individual providing services through an intermediary—such as a personal service company (PSC)—is assessed appropriately to determine whether they should be treated as an employee for tax purposes.
