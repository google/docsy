## Goal

The Account Escalation Process Working Group aims to improve the cross-functional collaboration when a customer is in an escalated state.

### Overview

The [account escalation process](/handbook/support/workflows/emergency-to-escalation-process.html) can involve stakeholders from CS, Support, Engineering as well as
Sales or other areas of the company. This is a keystone process that requires cross-functional attention to improve.

### Goals

This is a non-comprehensive list of topics to be discussed.

- [What is the single source of truth for knowing which customers are escalated?](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/tam/-/issues/619)
- How can we make account escalations easier to declare? (see: [Declaring an Incident](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#declaring-an-incident))
- How can we better prepare CS and Support ICs to work within escalations
- Reduce the ambiguity in roles between CS and Support

### Exit Criteria

1. Create an SSOT for knowing which customers are escalated.
1. Create training materials suitable for a future OKR for CS and Support
1. Refine process of declaring an account escalation so that anyone in the company can do it with minimal effort (MR: [www-gitlab-com!114418](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/114418/)
1. Refine roles and responsibilities of CS and Support within account escalations to reduce ambiguity
1. Develop a method of communication appropriate for e-group stakeholders, for example a "hot customer list" published in the #e-group channel at some cadence. ([gitlab-com/chief-of-staff-cto#67](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/chief-of-staff-cto/-/issues/67))
