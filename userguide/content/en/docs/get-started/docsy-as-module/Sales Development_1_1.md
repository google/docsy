### Where to find your leads and accounts
Inbound leads get automatically imported to SFDC by the Sales Operations team, you can find links to their handbook pages on our [main page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/).
To find and access your leads, please:
1. Navigate to SFDC’s homepage
1. Click on the `Leads` tab.
You will find the lead views below. These views are split per use-case for your convenience. The KPIs for managing these leads are thoroughly outlined in our [SLAs page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#inbound-lead-management).

### How to do Lead Database Management
As part of your SDR responsibilities, you are expected to perform due diligence on each lead you receive. This includes checking the database for duplicate records, as well as referencing against our [RoE](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/go-to-market/rules-of-engagement/).
1. Open the lead you want to investigate and press the `Find Duplicates` on the top of the lead’s record.
1. Check through all the records that show up, from leads to Acccounts. Make sure to search for `Domain` and `Last Name` if the data you have seems incomplete.
1. Check the `Matched Account Info` section on the lead record. 
1. If there’s no matched account, but there’s another lead at same company that has the `MQL` status, assign both leads to the owner with the earliest `MQL Date`. 
1. BDRs receiving leads not associated with `Actively Working` accounts must assign back to SDR team or chatter mktgops support.
1. Qualified leads associated with “Actively Working” accounts are routed to BDR assigned to the Actively Working Account.
### Telco and Finserv Routing
For leads that connect to companies that operate in the Financial Services (AMER only) and Telecommunications (EMEA only) industries. We have a seperate routing process that supercedes all of our current [Rules of Engagement](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/go-to-market/rules-of-engagement/).
Only named TELCO/FinServe accounts are rolling up to the TELCO/FinServe territories. If a new account is a subsidiary of an existing carved company, it will need to be assigned to the AE owning the ultimate account. If it is a totally separate entity then it can be allocated to the regional AE. If a lead comes in that is related to a TELCO/FinServe account, it must be assigned to the BDR assigned on the account.
### Company Address Based Routing Information
In [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT-oOceFU6k&ab_channel=GitLabUnfiltered), a member of the Marketing Ops team goes over the Company address fields and how they are used for Accounting Routing and Opp assignment.
If you need to do edits to the database by merging leads together for any of the above steps, please reference the videos below for an explanation.

### Cleaning Poor Leads
Lastly, Every so often you may be assigned a lead that has no value to GitLab and is not worth keeping within our database. Qualities that define these types of leads include:
[Unsupported block type: table]
### How to action your leads
**1. Determining High-touch or Low-touch Groove Flow usage:**
1. Determine if the lead qualifies for a high touch or low touch Flow. 
1. Research the appropriate Groove collections for relevant collateral to be used. Most typically our High-Touch Collection or Low-Touch collections.
### Cold-Calling and Email Checkbox
Before calling any Lead or Contact, BDRs must ensure that the `Do Not Call` box is unchecked. If you speak to any anyone, including prospects and existing contacts, who ask you not to call them again, you must check this box. However, please do not delete the number as we need to know which number requested not to be called again. For any individuals who are opted-in to email, you may ask them if they wish to be called. If they express a desire to be called, you are then permitted to uncheck the `Do Not Call` box if it was previously checked. Also, if an individual expresses independently via email a wish to be called, you may uncheck the `Do Not Call` box. This email must be present in SFDC as proof of your authority to uncheck this box. You cannot send email requests to individuals not opted-in to email asking whether they would like to be called.
Our cold-calling best practices typically consist of 4 elements. A pattern interrupt, an elevator pitch and, if required, objection/trap-setting questions and Up-Front Contracts.
To be effective, these need to be customized to the individuals we call as per the logic below:
- Different Geographical Business Cultures
- Personality Type as per the DISC model
- Individual’s Role and Responsibilities
- Business’ Needs and Objectives
An unsubscribe link must be included on every email sent by a BDR, including responses to a prospect or contact. Please reach out to the Privacy Team via #privacy-team-help for the recommended language that should appear at the bottom of each outbound email.
### Do Not Call and Do Not Email Automations
Leads with certain criteria will be automatically labeled as **Do Not Call** and or **Do Not Email** shortly after loading into our database. It’s understandable this can be frustrating for certain territories. Please keep in mind, the criteria behind this automation has been set in order to follow local law. Please see the [Internal GitLab handbook](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-ops-and-analytics/marketing-operations/do-not-contact/?search=do%20not%20call) for more information on the triggers.
### How to Enroll to Groove by Clari
[Groove](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/groove/) is a tool used to automate emails in the form of flows. Users can track open rates, click-through rates, and response rates for various templates, and update flows based on these metrics. Groove also helps to track sales activities such as calls. All emails/calls/tasks made through Groove are automatically logged in Salesforce with a corresponding disposition. See below for instructions on how to enroll leads in Groove:
1. Go to your SDR views in Salesforce and select the lead you want to add to a flow.
1. Press `Add To Groove Flow`.
1. Work from the Groove extension on Chrome to select the flow you want to enroll the lead in by using the labels feature.
1. Once the first step of a Groove flow is complete, the lead status will automatically change from `MQL`, `Inquiry`, or `Raw` to `Accepted`, marking that you are actively working on this lead.
1. When a lead responds to your outreach, their status will automatically change from `Accepted` to `Qualifying`. Manage these leads from your S3 and B5 lead views.
1. If you are not actively qualifying this lead further, manually change the status to `Recycle`, so the lead is returned to the Marketing recycle pool and isn’t stuck in your `My Qualifying` view.
1. If you speak with the lead by phone and are qualifying them, manually change the status from `Accepted` to `Qualifying`.
1. When reviewing your `Qualifying` view, add leads with no recent activity, no active tasks, and not currently in a flow into one of our follow-up Groove Flows under the `MOTION: Follow-Up` category.
1. Tasks and pipeline management can be done via Groove’s [Actions View](https://groove.clari.com/actions).
1. In the Actions View, review the list of leads assigned to you by navigating to the play-icon button for each to start their corresponding action for the day.
1. If a lead completes a Groove flow without responding, the lead status will automatically change to `Unresponsive` or `Recycle` after seven days of no response.
1. Manually change the lead status if you do not use a Groove flow to reach out or if you need to disqualify a lead (e.g., for bad data).
1. If you mark a lead as `Inactive` or a contact as `Inactive`, signifying that this person no longer works at the company, any running Flow will automatically be marked as finished.
1. If your leads are being reassigned to the `Inquiry Queue`, it’s likely due to a scheduled cleanup job in Traction that updates `Status = Inquiry` to `Inquiry Queue`. To resolve this, add your leads to a Groove flow. 
### Groove Labels
We’ve organized our **Groove Labels** into key categories like **industry, region, play/motion**, or **language** to help you efficiently retrieve the most appropriate content quickly.
### How to Use Groove Labels
On the top-hand of the [flows page](https://groove.clari.com/flows), access the filter menu and search per `label`.
1. **Industry**: Industry-specific labels that group flows per similar sectors.
1. **Region**: Flows organized by geographical regions, enabling you to target leads with more region-appropriate cadences based on local business culture.
1. **Play/Motion**: Each label within this category represents a specific sales play or marketing motion. These labels help you align leads with the appropriate strategy based a company’s and customer’s identified value-drivers.
1. **Language**: Language-based labels to ensure that you can easily find non-English collateral for our global audience.
### Groove Templates
We’ve organized our **Groove Templates** in the same way as our **Groove Labels** —by **industry, region, play/motion**, and **language**—to streamline your outreach efforts. These templates provide consistency and efficiency, and need to be created regardless if you’re sending one-off messages or using templates to structure a flow.
We currently have one master SalesDev folder for saving templates, please ensure that any templates that you create are saved under that folder, and tagged with the appropriate collection as per the logic outlined above.
In both cases, it’s essential to tag your templates with the appropriate collection name to maintain consistency and help others easily locate them for future use.
### New Groove Flow creation
Please follow the instructions on [the Groove handbook page here](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/groove/)
**Implement Measurement Clarity and Decision Velocity**
By dogfooding GitLab we have a structured and simplified cadence of quantifying Flowe creation in terms of value and results without limiting agency.
**Maintain Equal Contributions in a Shared Reality** By maintaing a Single Source of Truth (SSoT) we give the best possible forum for cross-functional collaboration with specific guidelines
**Important Note: Ramping BDRs** Ramping BDRs should only be using OB Flows from the Good and Testing collections. A ramping BDR can only create a Flow Creation Request if there is no Flows that fit their needs or strategy in our current library.
### Follow Up Groove Flows
For SDRs and BDRs managing leads in their qualifying views, we’ve created [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbvSCY7mESc) to guide you through using follow-up Groove Flows.
Please visit the Groove Flows page and search for the tag `MOTION: Follow-up` to review your available options.
### White Glove Event Follow Up Flows
For more personal events, such as Executive Roundtables, there may be more detailed Last Event Notes that include a request to involve people who interacted with the prospect at the event. For these situations, we have specialized white glove Flows. These can be found by searching for the tag `MOTION: White Glove`
The goal of these Flows is to reach out to the prospect quickly and to include our SAEs/AEs in the conversation.
- The first step is to add the prospect to the Flow. Then, customize the first email step to include the individuals mentioned in the Last Event Notes. You can also delay the first email to allow time for feedback from the SAE/AE if needed.
- Next, send a screenshot of the first email step to the SAE/AEs who will be CC’d. Explain that this strategy allows them to engage with more personalized messaging if the prospect remains unresponsive. 
### High Priority Campaigns and Leads
A High Priority Lead is a lead that is related to a high priority campaign. Any campaign checked as High Priority will have any members that relate to Actively Working accounts marked as High Priority irregardless of their lead status. These will show up in the BDR’s B1 priority view. Check the high priority timestamp and high priority reason fields in salesforce to understand why a lead was marked high priority.
If you need to move a lead out of high prioriy without contacting them you can [use this flow.](https://groove.clari.com/flows/1097000) This flow is one generic task for you to complete that will move the lead to accepted status and remove the high priority check.
### How to Change your Email Signature
You must change your email signature [in Terminus](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/terminus-email-experiences/) in order for your signature to save. If you only change your signature in Groove or Gmail your signature will revert back within 24 hours.
**Steps to change your signature**
1. [Log into Terminus](https://email2.terminusplatform.com/users/sign_in/) using your GitLab Google Account
1. After logging in click on the Terminus logo in the top left corner
1. Next click the menu item for “Email Experiences”
1. From there you can edit your signature and see a preview of it on the right side of your screen.
### How to follow our FO Outbound Process
BDR outbound lead generation is done by prospecting to companies and individuals who could be a great fit for our product. Prospecting is the process of finding and developing new business through searching for potential customers with the end goal of moving these people through the sales funnel until they eventually convert into customers.
BDRs will work closely with their dedicated SAE or AE to choose which accounts move into “Actively Working”. Together they will build a strategy for those companies. It is crucial that outreach is very intentional and strategic. When reaching out, we want BDRs to offer value and become a trusted advisor, ensuring a positive impression is left whether there is current demand or not.
The FO Outbound process is split in four phases, which should be followed on a weekly basis to ensure a steady outbound pipeline in alignment with our internal KPIs. To manage this process we use a set of datapoints on SFDC on the account-level that are marked under the section “BDR Comments”. Please reference the guide below on an explanation on how they work.
[Unsupported block type: table]
### Planning Phase (4-5 hours/week)
**1A. Create a set of achievable objectives**
These goals should be based on what you know you can achieve when focusing on First Order accounts. It is particularly important to know your equation so you can map your activities to specific outcomes and goals in a predictable way.
The main objective you should be focusing at is to measure and plan what activity is required to achieve or increase the amount of First Order meetings.
**1B. Map your objectives to your data**
Research your territory to identify the true First Order (FO) accounts, ensuring no other subsidiaries have licenses, verifying there hasn’t been a lost renewal in the past 180 days, and confirming there are no open opportunities. The goal here is to vet your TAM (Total Addresable Market) so that you can start matching cohorts of accounts with the objectives that you’ve outlined in the previous step. Indicatively, you can export these accounts to a Google Sheet, or other SSoT of your preference, for tracking since these accounts will be marked as Actively Working at a future step further down the process.
Utilizing these accounts, create an outreach strategy and plan for the upcoming month and quarter. This strategy should include considerations such as the number of accounts to include in Flows per week and per month, the quantity of prospects from these accounts to add into Flows weekly, whether you intend to target specific personas, if you plan to employ targeted messaging, whether Flows will be used for high-priority targets, and the messaging approach you will implement. As previously mentioned, knowing your equation is important for your planning here. Please refer to the sheet linked above to determine your exact metrics.
### Account Research Phase (4-5 hours/week)
During your research phase for accounts to include in your Flows, thoroughly investigate and document pertinent information, which may include the below. [You can use the Claude prompt here to help you automate part of this process.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/issues/1231#note_2316335988)
- Identifying new strategic hires - ZoomInfo Scoops, Company Website or LinkedIn
- Discovering recent job openings in DevOps - Company Website or LinkedIn
- Monitoring for security breaches or threats - Tech News Websites
- Scanning for relevant news articles - Tech News Websites
- Gathering intelligence on competitors - ZoomInfo or Cognism Insights
- Examining future plans, such as digital transformation initiatives - ZoomInfo Scoops, Company Website or LinkedIn
- Noting recent company acquisitions - ZoomInfo
- Investigating LinkedIn connections - LinkedIn
- Identifying instances of GitLab usage by employees or as a past customer - SFDC or 6Sense
- Exploring 2nd and 3rd-degree connections - LinkedIn or 6sense Persona Heatmap
- Seeking mentions of DevOps - ZoomInfo Scoops or 6Sense Timeline
- Reviewing relevant 10K reports or financial disclosures - Company Website
This comprehensive research will provide valuable insights for crafting effective outreach strategies further down the funnel. Regarding account research, in addition to our B2B database toolstack, we also use 6Sense to pre-qualify the accounts that should be considered for our pipelines since 6Sense scores accounts based on their market and profile fit.
There are two ways utilize 6Sense:
- Through the SFDC iframe integrated dashboard (mandatory for FY24Q3)
- Through the 6Sense Platform (optional for this Quarter)
### 2A. Using 6Sense through the SFDC dashboard
1. Navigate to SFDC
1. On the main tab with options (leads, accounts, etc), click on the “+” sign
1. Select 6Sense dashboards, you can also click “customize my tabs” to add the 6sense dashboard to your homepage permanently
1. On the 6Sense dashboard, click the cog icon on the top right
1. On “Search by User” select “BDR Assigned” and add your name
1. On “Other filters” select “Salesforce Account fields” and type “BDR Prospecting Status”
1. On the “BDR Prospecting Status” field, select “Actively Working”
The dashboard will now display the top actively working accounts in your name. Do note that these are only accounts that we currently have on our database, while you can find greenfield accounts by visiting the SaaS platform (instructions in section 2B). Section 3 below explains how you can review and utilize this data.
### 2B. Using 6Sense through the SaaS platform
Navigate to 6Sense through Okta On the left-hand bar, click on the Segments tab You will find all of the relevant resources for BDRs and SDRs on the first 5 folders. These folders can be used as per the table below. (In each folder you will find a saved template that can be cloned and edited for your individual territories.)
[Unsupported block type: table]
After choosing the type of report you’d like to work, please follow the steps below:
1. Select the template in each of the BDR folders that starts with the prefix “-[TEMPLATE]”.
1. On the title, add your name or territory as suggested by the naming convention. Please make sure to delete the Prefix “-[TEMPLATE]”.
1. Click on “Edit Segment”.
1. For folders 1 and 3, you’ll see a prompt on one of the filters to add your name to the “BDR Assigned” Field.
1. For folder 2, you’ll see a prompt to add your region to the “Address: Region” field. Do note that based on your territory there are other datapoints like “Address: City” or “Address: Country” that can be used.
1. After having done the edits on steps 4 and 5, press “Save Changes”. Make sure that you’ve updated the naming convention accordingly and click “Save As New Segment”.
### 3. Manual Research on Accounts
No matter how efficiently we’re trying to use our toolchain, these tools are still prone to error, and manual research is required to best shortlist the prospecting lists that cross-referencing will provide.Manual research will also provide additional context that can be used to hyper-personalize your outreach to your prospects.
For each account that you want to investigate, start with SFDC to make sure that there are no duplicate accounts. The report templates in 6Sense should exclude existing customers or accounts actively prospected, but we cannot automatically exclude accounts that have a different naming or domain on salesforce (ie. GitLab and GTLB)
The importance of diligent manual research will lead to the below efficiencies:
→ Better use of time in the long-run by making sure accounts are indeed within your segment and territory, or are not duplicates.
→ Avoiding unecessary RoE conflicts by making sure there are no hidden parent accounts that would cause SAO ownership to be re-assigned to other segments in the future.
**1. To double-check the account on Salesforce:**
1. Search for the account name on SFDC.
1. Search for the account email domain on SFDC.
1. Search for the account website domain on SFDC.
1. Search for the Account’s HQ address, along with any regional business unit address.
**2. To hyper-personalize your messaging:**
Please follow the steps below to understand how to research the data provided on 6Sense, and to cross-reference this data with our internal knowledge base so that you create your account strategy accordingly.
1. Understand and utilize 6Sense data: Each segment has an accounts tab that displays all the accounts that correspond to this segment. This view can be shortlisted further by using the three analytics tabs as all datapoints in these tabs is clickable. 
1. Search for past opportunities on SFDC 
1. Search for the account record on SFDC 
1. Search for relevant leads on SFDC: 
1. Cross-reference with External sources 
1. Cross-reference the above with HighSpot 
### Execution Phase (5-10 hours/week)
**Exporting Accounts and Leads to SFDC, and adding to your Outbound Pipeline.**
After having manually shortlisted the accounts that are applicable to your campaign, the next step is to determine the relevant prospects per account and export them to SFDC. It is important to add accounts to your outbound pipeline so that AEs and other SDRs/BDRs know this is an account that is already being touched, and to avoid confusion or multiple people approaching the same prospects. Before moving an account into “Actively Working Status”, make sure there have been no MQLs or opportunities created from that account within the past 30 days, and there are no leads from that account in Qualifying status with activity in the last 30 days or with a future task date set. If you are not sure, double-check with the related AE, SDR or BDR.
To determine which prospects to enroll per account, please follow the steps below:
- Identify the idea value drivers to be used for the account’s pain-points through your manual research, as outlined above.
- Determine which personas would most benefit from the specific value drivers by using our CoM documentation on HighSpot.
- Run queries for the specific titles on ZoomInfo, and export to CRM.
You should explore the specific personas you intend to target, such as: VPs, Directors, Developers, Security, Architecture, DevOps, DevSecOps, Procurement Officers, and IT Buyers.
Determine the number of prospects you plan to add to Flows, with a minimum of 25 per day. Utilize LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ZoomInfo or Cognism to identify these personas within your target companies.
In Step 7, compile the selected prospects and create LinkedIn Sales Navigator lists for each persona. Save these lists for future use.
**To export to CRM, please follow the guidelines below:**
- Click the Export to CRM button on ZoomInfo
- That’s it
- No, really.
**To fill in the BDR fields, please follow the guidelines below:**
Use the [format found on this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EN2U8wrUdti4MTxCNceoOlltAmtUt4pqN1GxwRTCnK4/edit) Copy-Paste the Structure to the BDR Account Research field and populate accordingly. Populate the BDR Next Step Date to be at the end of the account’s Flows length (typically one month out)
### 6. Maintaining a clean pipeline, and using BDR fields for cross-functional collaboration
To review your current pipeline, along with any leads with next steps, please refer to your segments dashboards by going to SFDC > Dashboards and searching for Watch and Help.
Team specific variants of these dashboard components will also be found on your team’s dashboard. These dashboards will give you a bird’s eye view of what actions are required from to maintain a clean pipeline, in terms of: i. Accounts with BDR fields past due ii.
Prospects with Flow steps past due
iii. Prospects that have been moved to Qualifying status but have not had any outreach since.
### How to Get SAO Credit and Create Opportunities
Qualification criteria is a minimum set of characteristics that a lead must have in order to be passed to sales and become a Sales Accepted Opportunity (SAO), these are split into [Inbound and Outbound Criteria.](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#opportunities)
As an SDR or BDR, you will work to connect with inbound/outbound leads that you get a response from to obtain the applicable information required. This information is tracked on the qualification criteria on the `LEAD, CONTACT, and OPPORTUNITY` objects in Salesforce. In order to obtain an SAO, you will need to have the `required information` filled out on the opportunity including documented 2-way communication on the Contacts in the Opportunity. Professional Services opportunities are not credited to sales development, these need to be passed straight to the account AEs for them to qualify.
**When do I create an Opportunity?**
1. 
1. 
**Who owns the opportunity at this point?**
1. 
1. 
**When will it be credited as an SAO?**
After the AE/SAL meets with the prospect to verify and supplement qualification criteria, they will move the opportunity into Stage 1 Discovery. The AE/SAL is expected to move the opportunity into the correct stage within 48 hours of the meeting reflected in the “Next Step” date field. The opportunity close date defaults to the last day of the quarter, however it’s good practice to set the date at least 90 days out from creation date.
If an opportunity has incorrect data after it has moved into Stage 1 - Discovery, please Chatter your manager about the required changes, they will then Chatter someone from Sales Dev Operations (Ramona, Panos, Ed) once final changes are agreed upon. No one else from Sales Dev can edit opportunities once they are in Stage 1, so please try and ensure you have all the information on the opportunity before you ask the AE/SAL to accept it.
If the opportunity is for a new group of users in a Large account where sales is working on a large “central” opportunity, then your opportunity should be merged to that opportunity for you to get credit for the users you have brought to the deal. See under [Stage 8](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#opportunity-stages) in the Sales Go To Market Handbook.

### Trial Extensions and Ultimate to Premium Downgrades
To submit a trial extension ticket for a prospect you will navigate [to this internal request form](https://support-super-form-gitlab-com-support-support-op-651f22e90ce6d7.gitlab.io/) and fill it out the form using the **“GitLab L&R internal request for global customers”** option and then select extend a gitlab.com trial. Keep in mind it only works for SaaS and not self-managed.
You are also able to downgrade a Trial from Ultimate to Premium through the internal request form. You just have to choose “Change existing GitLab.com Trial plan”
### Opportunity Naming Convention
- New Business: [Quantity] 
- Add-On Business (seats only): 
- Add-On Business (Upgrade from Premium to Ultimate): 
### Monthly Audit Process
In an effort to increase transparency as well as consistency in terms of credit attribution for opportunities sourced by the Sales Development organization, we will conduct on a monthly basis a full audit of all opportunities giving credit to either a Sales Development or a Business Development Representative. Please do note that SDRs/BDRs that are on their ramping quarter are exempt from being auditors.
Participating and completing the audit on time is mandatory.
Guiding principles:
1. All activities must be logged and documented in Salesforce.
1. Timestamps for such activities will be audited and cannot be modified after the fact Sourcing cases must be clearly documented.
1. All opportunities associated with a Sales Development team member must have meaningful engagement for Web Directs and full qualifications criteria for Direct Deals.
**Mandatory SLA:** Audit and XDR response must be completed by the first day of the following month. Rulings will be completed by the management team by the end of the second day. Invitations and pairing will be sent to the entire Sales Dev team the first week of the month. It is the responsibility of the team member to find a backfill to do their audit if they are unable to complete the audit within set timelines.
### XDR’S RESPONSIBILITY
1. All activities must be logged in Salesforce. Pro-actively flag opportunities with questions or created outside the standard process in the monthly [Audit Doc.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IBSfKuK6QcvsAIPvW7uYYCjeMtqPmpeDv2swsPAZShc/edit#gid=0). Please note that there’s a separate audit worksheet specific to the PubSec team that is shared separately for compliance reasons.
Examples: web directs. AE-created. Partner generated (for now), Opp w/no value, duplicate opp
### AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY
1. Auditor needs to review all notes and time stamps related to the opportunity
1. Auditor needs to log an activity #Audited on the activity record of the opportunity as mentioned below, this way we can track completion of monthly audit.
1. Ensure that relevant activity & products are attached.
1. Ensure that Products match up to Qualification info in Call Connect and/or Meeting
1. For BDRs, ensure account was in AWA status ensuring that the [RoE](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#rules-of-engagement-quick-guide) was followed
1. Flag in the monthly [Audit Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IBSfKuK6QcvsAIPvW7uYYCjeMtqPmpeDv2swsPAZShc/edit#gid=0), any questions related to the audited opportunities.
### AUDIT PROCESS
Each month you will be assigned one of your peers to Audit. We will share a report with all the S1 opportunities created that month. SDRs will audit SDRs and BDRs will audit BDRs. We will do our best to pair people from the same segment however it is possible that you end up auditing someone from another segment.
Once you’ve audited an opp, you will create a task by logging a call, choose “other” as type, and write “#Audited” in the subject line. If an opp needs more research, write “#Audited - Pending Review” and add this opp into the Audit Review spreadsheet.
[**Audit Process Video Walkthrough**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef8gFx0lR48)
### AUDIT REVIEW (what to look for)
[Unsupported block type: table]
### Typical Red Flags
1. Opportunity Source: Sales Qualified Source should be SDR generated if not validate that there is a sourcing case documented.
1. Created by: The XDR should create the opportunity, if not, there should be a written explanation
1. Did the XDR set and complete a meeting on the same day without previous activity?
1. Are there duplicate opportunities?
1. Is NetARR missing?
*Directors, Ops and JB will select random opps each month to audit and ensure audit process is being followed*
### Best practices to ensure credit for SAO
1. Add all leads to Flows, if you’re reaching out to them.
1. Make sure your activity is logged that shows how you drove the meaningful engagement that led to the opportunity.
1. Populate all qualification fields
1. If activity was a phone call or a zoom call, log notes at the time of call
1. If a meeting was set, make sure you create a stage 0 opportunity prior to the meeting, populate fields during/afterwards. If person will likely web direct, keep opp in your name and update next steps, ensure that prospect is guided to web-direct using the Flow [here](https://groove.clari.com/flows/1097006), as per the conversation [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/issues/817).
1. If engagement is in LinkedIn or Whatsapp, take a picture and attach to chatter/opp
1. If activity happened at an event, make sure that immediately following the event, you create a stage 0 opportunity and send follow up email that recaps the conversation that took place

## Our Complementary Resources
### Best Practices for Outbound BDRs
### Cold-Calling and Email Checklist
Our cold-calling best practices typically consist of 4 elements. A pattern interrupt, an elevator pitch and, if required, objection/trap-setting questions and Up-Front Contracts.
To be effective, these need to be customized to the individuals we call as per the logic below:
- Different Geographical Business Cultures
- Personality Type as per the DISC model
- Individual’s Role and Responsibilities
- Business’ Needs and Objectives
### Call Scripts
You can find three examples of our cold call scripts in the description of the [BDR 101 Level Up Course](https://university.gitlab.com/learn/course/bdr101-outbound-cold-calling/bdr101-outbound-calls/f50b8a1c-712b-44e7-a30f-2ddbbc835ccf?client=internal-team-members&page=5)
The main documentation may be [found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3iV_WW5fRidRN5H8-3SZVAAr3ffEvjxUC6cW5SFXDM/edit) and the library of resources [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VhxVwy4DoEvFco_wXeOLb0DLtVIfo7wQ).
### Up-Front Contract
Typically used for scheduled calls and Up-Front Contracts. UFCs can also be used as a defense mechanism when cold calling does not go as planned. For cold-calling, UFCs are used when the prospect can commit to 15’ at the time of the call. If they commit to a 15’ for a later time, UFCs are used to open the call and set the agenda then.
Explore the main documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7qEq8g3eHh5-oagERGvNmatiOV3JXi9Tw46SKWwpNM/edit).
### Decision Maker Discovery
The questions below are suggestions to be used while doing a discovery call, in order to identify the decision making process, and to meet the outbound accepted SAO as per the guidelines [here.](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#criteria-for-outbound-sales-accepted-opportunity-sao)
- Who gets involved while evaluating a tool at {{company}}?
- Would you expect anyone to challenge your initiative, and if so can I help by connecting with anyonse else on your end?
- If you as a {{title}} wanted to purchase GitLab, what process internally would you have to follow, and how can we help you navigate it?
- What challenges do you expect to face when trying to pitch this change internally? Who has a say in this and what do they care about the most?
### Email Writing Cheat Sheet
The table below shows the Command of the Message Email Writing Checklist.
It aims to outline the structure of the emails we write to prospects. Emails should be written in each person’s language and tone and make sure to include the CoM frameworks as per the outline below. You can find additional resources [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-DF6bEtS9QF9idqBcK77RiLL04CKiFMuc0LDEM5N6RA/edit)

### Making Changes to the handbook
[Video Walkthrough of how to make changes to the GitLab Handbook for the Sales Development org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Nv7bzksiY&t=1032s)
One of our Values is being handbook first.
In order to align the SDR organization more closely to this ideal, below are suggested steps. Please remember that the Handbook is a living document, and you are strongly encouraged to make improvements and add changes. This is ESPECIALLY true when it comes to net new solutions that should be shared so the whole organization has access to that process. (aka The DevOps ideal of turning “Localized Discoveries” into “Global Knowledge”.)
Steps:
- Have a change you want to make to the handbook? Great!
- Navigate to the source code of the page in the handbook (e.g. Link to edit the SDR page in the Handbook )
- Click either “Edit” or “Web IDE” to make your changes.
- Have a brief but descriptive “Commit message” (e.g. “Add new section on ‘How to Make Changes to the Handbook’”) and commit your changes
- Fill out the Merge Request details
### BDR Territory Movement Rules of Engagement
When a territory moves from one BDR to another but the previous BDR remains with the same team (ex: moves from one MM territory to another) the BDR vacating the territory will have the chance to temporarily retain ownership of accounts with which they have generated ongoing engagement (subject to manager approval). At the time of the holdover, an issue will be created that will be reviewed in 30 days to verify account ownership. This includes:
- The outgoing BDR will be allowed to hold back for 30 days any account with which they can demonstrate two-way engagement that could potentially lead to an IQM and new opportunity. If, after 30 days, no IQM has been set and no stage 0 opportunity exists, the account will be moved by the manager to the new BDR assigned to the territory. If the outgoing BDR is successful in generating a new opportunity, the account will remain with them until the opportunity is either qualified or unqualified.
- The outgoing BDR will be allowed to hold back for 30 days any account with which there is an existing stage 0 opportunity where they are listed as the BDR. After 30 days if the opportunity is not qualified, the account will be moved by the manager to the new BDR assigned to the territory.
- In instances where an account has been reassigned to the new BDR and the outgoing BDR had two-way engagement more than 30 days ago with the account but was unable to convert them to an SAO, and the account later returns unprompted and with no prior activity from the new BDR assigned to the territory and wants to pursue a conversation with sales, the team (manager) will receive SAO credit from any resulting opportunity.
- Any other situations that arise which result in a credit dispute will be investigated and resolved by the BDRs’ leader and senior leader.
### Assigning SAO Credit when a Territory Change is Uncovered during Discovery
There will be times when an SDR or BDR is working a prospect and, after connecting with the prospect, discovers that the corresponding account actually belongs to a different segment than originally thought. This could be due to newly uncovered information regarding employee count, HQ location, or parent account relationship. SAO credit in these situations will vary based on the circumstances and will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Specifically:
- If the SDR or BDR has done their due diligence to verify account information and still ends up finding an opportunity outside of their territory: as long as the related account isn’t an AWA and there is no related activity from an SDR in the past 30 days, and the SDR or BDR’s manager has verified that the accurate information could not have been uncovered prior to engaging with the prospect, then that SDR or BDR and their team will get SAO credit.
- If the related account is an AWA or there is related activity from an SDR in the past 30 days, SAO credit will belong to the BDR assigned to the AWA or the SDR working the lead related to the account.
- If the related account isn’t an AWA and there is no related activity from an SDR in the past 30 days, but the SDR or BDR’s manager determines that the accurate information should have been uncovered prior to engaging with the prospect, SAO credit will be assigned to the team manager assigned to the correct territory.
- Any other situations that arise which result in a credit dispute will be investigated and resolved by the SDR or BDR’s leader and senior leader.
**In situations where an SDR or BDR has received conflicting information and it is unclear what the correct territory is for an account, they should Chatter the AEs assigned to the potential territories and have them figure out who owns it.**
### Working with Resellers
The end-user account determines the BDR/SDR alignment: If you are the SDR assigned to the 3rd party lead, please gather the information in point 1 and pass the lead to the correctly assigned BDR (the BDR assigned to the end-user account) who will complete points 2-6
[Unsupported block type: table]
### SDR/BDR to AE SAO Handoff Process
The purpose of the BDR-AE outbound handoff process is three fold.
- Ensure Outbound prospects get the best experience possible.
- Ensure the BDR team enjoys operational efficiencies and have clearly structured ways to collaborate with the AE team on outbound accounts.
- Ensure the AE team is set up for success is receiving outbound leads in a structured manner and have the appropriate information to utilize in converting them.
To make sure that the hand-offs maximize internal efficiencies, it is required that:
- The BDR team makes sure to book calls, with a minimum notice time of 48 business hours.
- The BDR team makes sure to properly fulfil Outbound SAO criteria, or work with AE to create a mutual command plan.
- The AE team makes sure to: 
### 1. BDR Qualified Meeting
- Are leads that have been qualified by the BDR over a Discovery call.
- [CoM principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m5YBOCc--M1Iq5-SEEd2OUWDjYyc6VJ3xTsDEEqisUQ/edit) have been applied to the call and some of the Before/After Scenarios, Positive Business Outcomes, Requirements and Metrics have been identified and agreed upon between the prospect and the BDR.
- There is a clear need or intent identified from the side of the company, and the prospect has clearly articulated a path to the ultimate decision-maker, as per the guidelines for outbound SAO criteria.
**BDR steps after discovery call**
- Summarize CoM principles uncovered during the call
- Schedule next step through Groove while being on the call with the prospect 
- Send AE Intro Email 
- Log Required SFDC fields and populate Notes field.
- Unless there’s a scheduling conflict for the BDR, attend Evaluation Orchestration Call and kick-off the call: 
### 2. Joint IQM
- Are meetings booked with leads that are from pre-agreed upon Actively Working Acounts.
- Calls scheduled for these prospects will be taken as a joint IQM with both BDR and AE attending, and leading the qualification.
- CoM principles will be applied during the call, with the goal of uncovering a clear need and path to the ultimate decision-maker, as per the guidelines for outbound SAO criteria.
**BDR steps before discovery call**
- Schedule next step through Groove while being on the call with the prospect, and schedule straight to the AEs calendar. 
- Create SFDC opportunity, and log any pre-determined or relevant information from your past reseearch.
- Communicate with AE, and create a mutual command plan for the call. 
### Organizing a Group Demo
Organizing a shared demo makes it more simple for us to offer spontaneously a demonstration of GitLab, which should result in a easier handover of opps, and ease to create opps. As BDRs, we arranged the execution of this demo by creating a zoom webinar, and configuring the whole event so that the administrative side is automated.

### Growth Strategies, Ranking and RoE
**Strategies:**
- Growth within an existing customer account: BDR should strategically partner with SAE/ISR to identify additional business units to bring into the conversation as growth opportunities. Renewal dates should be exploited.
- Expansion into parent/children/subsidiaries of existing customer accounts: These are accounts that fall within the corporate hierarchy within Salesforce. If a child/subsidiary account is identified via ZoomInfo but not in our system, then BDR should follow the following process: Create a LEAD for that account and then convert to CONTACT to create the ACCOUNT when you qualify your first lead.
- Free to paid upgrades: Existing Core/CE users can be targeted to upgrade to a paid version of GitLab
**Ranking and prioritization of accounts:**
- Rank 1: Expand with Purpose (EwP) accounts should be closely/strategically worked with SAEs. These accounts have High 6Sense intent scores and should therefore be High touch by BDR.
- Rank 2: ICP Ultimate parent accounts that have Core/CE-Users in a hierarchy, Total CARR/LAM for account, Med/Low 6Sense intent scores, and small renewals in current FQ.
- Rank 3: As above but are not our ICP
**Professional Services Opportunities**
A Professional Services Opportunity will be used to cover any integration, consulting, training or other service that a Sales rep will sell to a prospect/client and needs or wants to be invoiced separately. To invoice separately a new quote and opportunity must be created.

### Claude
Claude is an AI assistant from Anthropic. It can help with analysis, content writing, research, spreadsheet organization and other tasks.
### Claude Sales Dev BDR/SDR User Guide
- [Prompt Library](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/issues/1231) - a place to find prompts the Sales Dev Org is currently using and collaborating on
- [Business Development Prospecting Claude Project](https://claude.ai/project/92974b9b-f70e-4d74-9288-20c443617e9c)
- [AMER Calling Analysis Claude Project](https://claude.ai/project/0196022b-a414-7215-9cf0-22ec8e19f9aa)
- [EMEA Calling Analysis Claude Project](https://claude.ai/project/01961368-cd7e-7652-a1e3-3d2427367998) 
**Limitations**
- Claude’s knowledge cutoff is April 2024, so any GitLab features, pricing, or competitive details may be outdated. Always verify current information through official GitLab channels.
- Claude can’t access GitLab systems, databases, or customer information directly. While Claude can analyze data you share, it can’t pull anything from GitLab’s internal tools or CRM. [Adding up to Orange Data has been approved.](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/ai-at-gitlab/#5-what-type-of-data-is-okay-to-be-shared-with-claude)
- Claude can’t connect to external websites, APIs, or tools. If you need Claude to review specific content, you’ll need to paste it directly into the conversation.
- Claude can’t maintain context between conversations - each chat starts fresh, so previous discussions about prospects or strategies won’t be remembered.
- Understand that **Claude is not always right and will sound very confident even when it is wrong**
**General Tips**
- Treat it like you are having a conversation with a highly intelligent robot (ex. C3P0)
- Always try to ask follow up questions to get better answers
- You can always have Claude write ideal prompts for you!
- Because Claude’s data cut off is from April you can upload up to date target account’s 10Ks, annual reports, and investor letters for up to date research
- You can use Claude to help you reformat your spreadsheets! It is recommended to upload your data in CSV format.
**Examples of Questions to Ask**
- “Can you see if this companies’ annual report mentions DevOps, Software, Cyber Security, Git?
- “Can you make this email reply more concise?”
- “Let’s say I was a sales rep from GitLab. How should I approach this company/title?” (Can use Panos’s prompt in the prompt library as well )
- “Can you explain why you gave x answer?”
- “Can you rewrite that in a more casual tone?”
- “I do not like that message you generated.Can you give me 3more options and explain the pros and cons of each?”

### Qualified
[Qualified](https://www.qualified.com/) is the Sales Dev Org’s tool we use to chat with visitors on the GitLab website. Currently the SDR teams primarily respond to inbound chats and visitors using Qualified. The BDRs also have the ability to initiate chats with known leads from their actively working accounts.
### Gong
Refer to the [Gong](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-tools/gong/) handbook page for full details on how Gong is leveraged at GitLab.
Sales Development Org team members are provided with Gong collaborator licenses for visibility to recorded sales conversations.
SDR and BDR team members are able to leverage the `Gong Meeting` option when creating meeting invites for prospects and customers. By using this option and adding an Account Executive with Gong recorder access to the meeting invite, Gong will leverage the AE’s recorder access to record the meeting, assuming all meeting participants consent to record. More details about the Gong consent page can be found in the [Gong internal handbook page](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-tools/gong/#global-privacy-compliance). Once the recording is processed, the Account Executive that was added to the invite will be listed in Gong as the host and owner of the call with the SDR or BDR as an attendee.
### Crayon Competitive Messaging Resources
[Crayon](https://app.crayon.co/intel/gitlab/battlecards/) hosts competitive messaging resources that are maintained by GitLab’s product marketing team.
This is where you can find messaging related to GitLab vs some of our competiors such as GitHub, Atlassian, and Azure DevOps
### UserGems
[UserGems](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/usergems/) is a tool that tracks specific cohorts of people that we provide in terms of them changing jobs. This automated tracking provides valuable insights, surfacing warm leads that can drive faster, larger wins. This tool helps mitigate deal risks when key individuals leave accounts, and accelerates deal progress when influential contacts join new organizations.
### 1. When a person that we are tracking leaves their current place of employment
- These people are identified by the lead initial source being `UserGems Contact Tracking`
- UserGems will track that person to their new role and will automatically create a lead with their new details in our system.
- These leads will be flagged on the **Action Needed BDR dashboards** for you and your manager’s review, as well as on the [B2 views](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#bdr-lead-views)
- We expect that our [standard RoE](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#rules-of-engagement-roe) will be followed normally in actioning these leads, similar to MQLs.
- These leads will be routed to the BDR team if: 
- The rest of the leads that do not fit these parameters will be routed round-robin to the SDR team.
- These leads should also be considered as intent data for prospecting an outbound account. 
- If you’d like to iterate on any UserGems flows please follow the content creation process outlined [here.](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#flow-creation)
- We’ll also notify you via Slack and email about these Job Changes.
### 2. When a company that we are tracking gets a new hire or promotion
- These people are identified by the lead initial source being `UserGems - New Hires and Promotions`
- These people will be automatically be enrolled to a fully automated AI-driven sequence as per the guidelines below.
- Similar to above, the same people will be flagged on dashboards and reporting for you to consider as intent signals to add their respective accounts to your pipeline.
- We expect that our [standard RoE](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#rules-of-engagement-roe) will be followed normally.`
- We are actively working to remove irrelevant prospect titles from being created as part of the `UserGems - New Hires and Promotions` lead sources. If you notice any titles that you feel should not have been created because they’re irrelevant to DevOps decision-making in that company, please feel free to use the #usergems-feedback Slack channel to let us know, and we’ll work with our CSM to review them.
- In the meantime, you can also mark these leads as Status `Disqualified` and Disqualified reason `No Authority`
### 3. When people leave or join accounts where we have open oppourtunities
- While we are actively working to improve our back-end so that this cohort can be visible on our dashboards, like the use-cases above, we are relying on sending notifications only for these people. In the meantime, you can use the report here to gauge what prospects we have on [this list](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00OPL000007z6XV). We are currently notifying: 
- These people are not enrolled to a specific flow, since there multiple scenarios on how to best address them, please search Groove for templated messages [like this one](https://groove.clari.com/templates?fId=280305&tId=3285044) that you can use.
### Gem-E FY26 Auto Enrollment
For FY26Q1 we will pilot auto-enrolling UG leads to a dedicated Groove Flow which will make sure of UserGem’s AI functionalities.
- Leads that have no activity, and match the filters on the [SMB report here](https://gitlab.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00OPL00000E1hpG2AR/view) or [MM/ENTG report here](https://gitlab.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00OPL00000E1bYY2AZ/view) will be automatically added to either an [SMB](https://groove.clari.com/flows/1235331) or [MM/ENTG](https://groove.clari.com/flows/1199739) flow.
- These flows will automatically include AI generated customisation. Please review the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LlIjaRjwVaTI5XbWkU2fIEhhq7rYthuPGh-aaNqJz2o/edit#slide=id.g2d902c263b1_0_581) or the [video presentation here](https://www.loom.com/share/b3bc2eb774064800b8170c245434d17b) for a full walkthrough.
- These leads will be flagged on the dashboards similar to the explanation above and progress can be tracked from there.

### Sales Dev Operations Working Sessions
The Sales Dev Ops team also holds recurring weekly working sessions, with up to four participants per session. These sessions are aligned to the month’s theme outlined above, and are designed to collaborate on key operational topics and initiatives.
### Sales Dev Research Desk
Our Sales Dev Ops team can help you with researching our suite of databases (Sales Nav, ZoomInfo, Cognism, 6Sense) to help you manage your actively worked account list. We typically focus on accounts that are not currently available to our database, but can help with other ideas that you may have. Please log an issue to our board [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/boards/5569691) using the template `BDR_Research_Request`
### Sales Dev Housekeeping Issue
The team has an issue where we consolidate our monthly to-dos (titled `Monthly Housekeeping`). In this issue there’s also a section for any feedback that we gathered that month, so we can plan any next steps. If you’d like to add feedback directly please navigate to our [team’s board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/boards/5569691), find this month’s issue and log any feedback you have there.
### Manager Tool Certification
We have an end-to-end process and tool walkthrough that walks manager through all the knowledge and information they need to know to be able to use our tech stack, both for inbound and outbound processes. The full walkthrough of this training is [documented on the issue here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/issues/401). Moreover, abbreviated notes of the training can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1chOoHvwk-dSsAwoloZhdGiJJoFz0yjjq07kOYmzQUvQ/edit) and a list of questions that we expect our Managers to be able to answer [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/issues/302#note_2356378893).
### General leadership principles
This page will serve as a training resource and operational guide for current and future managers. All Sales Development Managers should follow the [general leadership principles](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/) set out in the handbook.
- [1-1s](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/1-1/)
- [Providing regular feedback](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#giving-feedback)

### Manager Onboarding
Onboarding is essential for all Sales Development Managers at GitLab. As part of onboarding, a [Becoming a GitLab Manager](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/Training/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/becoming-a-gitlab-manager.md) issue will be created for each manager when they join, or are promoted. This issue is intended to connect new managers with the crucial information they need, and ensure they have access to all the resources and training available.
### Outbound BDR Process Manager Onboarding
The BDR process that we have defined here in GitLab is meant to provide a repeatable set of steps that an outbound BDR can follow to achieve results. It is very important for an onboarding manager to align themselves as quickly as possible to this process as it is a proven method that will help them manage their team in a efficient and data-driven way.
The BDR Process is explained step-by-step in the [section here](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#how-to-follow-our-fo-outbound-process)
For a newcoming manager, we provide the [Manager attention needed boards](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#dashboards-for-leaders) that will be your main tool in understanding where your team is aligned to our BDR process, and where they need assistance.
To help structure your usage of the above, you can follow the steps below during your first month at GitLab while [the document here will be your main go-to resource](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18k1_jDHVgNzy2SzcPZ7GAOdJ6zb9i37Z4-V1-dEFKiU/edit)

### 1:1 Account and Lead Level Dashboard Coaching guidance
The table below can help with structuring how you perceive and action the 1:1 Dashboards we have on SFDC and Tableau, the below connect to the [KPI page here.](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#outbound-account-management) and the videos [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mOUGPVqhogmT0-mmqyhtiVKs4wmdHEZ_/view?usp=sharing) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L3a6-vpG562rY0u4Yve4d_y1148MIvNG/view?usp=sharing) are two quick compelementary resources to walk you through how we use the dashboards.
Additionally this [5’ video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dx57o5nu9xeHsvHUOC2XYryjxYmfdHvv/view?usp=sharing) explains the purpose of these dashboards, while this [3’ video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sf6vFSXb8iNaSGLGv-TtasuPS3xfz-Ni/view?usp=drive_link) walks you through a practical use case of how to use a report in these dashboards.

### Field Marketing <> BDR Collaboration Process
Our FM/BDR collaboration process is a method that we follow in the spirit of maximizing cross-functional collaboration. We have created an issue template for Field Marketers to populate, which in turns gets managed from the [Kanban Board here.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/boards/5665082) The premise of the [issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/FM_BDR_Collaboration_Template.md) and board is to streamline communication between our teams. The issue template very clearly articulates all next steps required of this process while it also tries to leave space for us much AdHoc collaboration as required for each specific event.
As a BDR Director you will be tagged first in this issue as the primary DRI, while as a BDR Manager you will be involved in this issue on a case-by-case basis by your regional Director. All next steps of this process are clearly mentioned in the template for the issue so please follow each step in turn. The Sales Dev Operations team is also tagged and will be there to monitor progress and offer help if requested.
### Status Related 6Sense Reports
On folder #5 in the [6Sense segments list](https://gitlab.abm.6sense.com/segments/manage), you’ll find the templates for the main three categories of accounts that we have. These templates are meant to be cloned and edited for your teams as per the guidelines below and will assist with coaching on 1:1s and team calls, as well as driving more predictable pipeline building.
[**Currently Actively Working Accounts Template**](https://gitlab.abm.6sense.com/segments/segment/495284/accounts/?mode=edit&segment_type=6sense_network)
- This report will cross-reference your team’s currently AWAs against 6Sense intent data, and will highlight the best ICP accounts currently on your team’s pipeline.
[**CE/SFDC Accounts not in Actively Working Status**](https://gitlab.abm.6sense.com/segments/segment/495296/accounts/?mode=edit&segment_type=6sense_network)
- This report will highlight the best ICP accounts on our existing database, that are not actively being pursued by your team.
[**Greenfield Accounts not in Actively Workin**](https://gitlab.abm.6sense.com/segments/segment/495295/accounts/?mode=edit&segment_type=6sense_network)
- This report will highlight the best ICP accounts that are NOt currently on our existing database. Please note that due to the complexity of our sales territories, there may be edits required on filter #8 (Address). There are multiple variants for City, Country or Region that can be used to accurately display each team’s territory. Please feel free to reach out to the Ops team to help you determine these and generate the best reports possible.
### Sales Dev Territory and Role Reports
[**Sales Dev by Salesforce Profile and Role -**](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008gonx)
- Sales Dev Ops profile is the only profile with the ability to help add a member to opps beyond stage 0 (we can’t add SDR/BDR to closed won opps however)
- Certain roles have certain permissions ie. Team Lead roles are able to transfer leads. Director level roles are able to help when account assignments are incorrect by updating account address and employee size information.
- Roles determine visibility based on the region (AMER, APAC, EMEA). Example: a BDR with EMEA in their role, will be able to see all accounts where the account territory owner has EMEA in their territory role name.
[**Sales Dev Territories by Team role/member associated with each territory -**](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008gpBL)
- This allows you to see what members/roles are associated with each territory. When you need a change in BDR assignment to a territory, please sharethe territory name with Sales Dev Ops, not the name of the account. Search for the account owner name and tell Sales Dev Ops which territory/territories require that BDR to be assigned.
### New Account AE Reports
- Use [this report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008gmAA) to figure out the territory name for the account you are working. Use command F to find the zip/state/country and figure out correct territory name.
- Then use [this report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008glPn) by plugging in the territory name to figure out who the correct AE is
- Please make sure you have all the correct location information on the lead you converting to initially create this new account.
### Onboarding
GitLab People Connect Team members will [create the onboarding issue](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/people-operations/people-connect/onboarding_process/#timing) and start completing the onboarding tasks, no later than one week before the new team member joins. People Connect Team members require a minimum of 4 business days (with the new hire timezone as the basis) before the new hire’s start date to complete all onboarding tasks. This issue will be automatically assigned to you. As a manager, you will [also have tasks](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/#managers-of-new-team-members) that need to be completed prior to the new team member’s start date.
The general onboarding issue will also automatically add a [‘Sales Development’ section](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/employment-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding_tasks/department_sales_development.md) under ‘Job Specific Tasks’ based on the role of the new SDR. Both you and your new hire will have tasks to complete in this section.
With the creation of this issue, an [access request (AR) will also be automatically created](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/role_baseline_access_request_tasks/department_sales_development) for a new team member on their second day at GitLab. This AR lists the role based entitlements (pre-defined groups and system-level access that are granted automatically to team members depending on their role) your new hire will need. *See what is being auto provisioned on this AR [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/role_baseline_access_request_tasks/department_demand_generation).
### New Hire’s First Day
On your new hire’s first day, the assigned People Connect Team member will [schedule a welcome email](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/people-operations/people-connect/onboarding_process/#day-1-onboarding-tasks) to arrive at 7:30am (local time of the new team member) on their start date detailing how your new hire can access GitLab and begin their onboarding process.
### Manager Onboarding Checklist

### Flow Creation
- We follow the process outlined [here](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#new-groove-flow-creation) for creating new content, when it comes to reviewing this content, the Sales Dev Ops team will follow a quarterly cadence of reviewing the Flows/campaigns that are on the In-flight column on the board [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/boards/5540104). We use the criteria below:
**1. Flow needs to be a globally applicable**
- Only Flows that could be used by any team member globally can be added to the Good Collection.
- If a regionalized Flows can be translated to English, then the English copy of it will be added to the GC while the local variant will be added to the Team Collection.
- Field Marketing event Flows and any other similar type will not be considered for the Good Collection.
**2. Flows needs to have completed the requirements set out on the issue descrption**
- At least 200 people enrolled and/or having completed the Flows on a timely manner.
- ( Flows has over 5% reply rate AND No less than 50% negative sentiment rate. ) OR Flows has over 5% meeting set rate.
### Things to look out for when reviewing a Flow as a Manager
- Does the messaging of the Flows follow Command Of the Message? 
- Is there a proper mix of automated and manual touches? 
- Are proper Groove elements used? 
- Is the purpose of the Flowsclearly articulated on the issue description? 
### Sales Development Onboarding
As BDRs and SDRs, you work closely with the larger marketing org as well as the sales team. Due to this, your onboarding will encompass training on tools and processes related to not only your role but a blend of marketing and sales.
This learning experience involves virtual self-paced learning paths in the form of a general company-wide onboarding issue, a Sales Development specific issue, as well as a Google Classroom course to prep you for [Sales Quick Start (SQS)](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/onboarding/). SQS is a 3-day in-person immersive and hands-on workshop for all new hires in a sales development or sales role. In parallel, you will meet regularly with your manager, onboarding buddy and members of our sales development enablement team to chat through and dig a bit deeper into the topics within your onboarding.
The goal in all of this is to ensure that you feel confident and comfortable to hit the ground running at the start of your second month on the job when you will have a [ramped quota](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#bdrsdr-quota-for-months-0-4-and-compensation). Our hope is that along this journey you are not only gaining the tactical skills needed to complete your job, but that you form connections with colleagues, gain a strong understanding of our culture, and begin to develop industry knowledge.
### Sales Development Onboarding Process
1. The People Team initiates a general GitLab onboarding issue for every new GitLab team member. On your first day, you will receive a welcome email with a link to your specific onboarding issue and steps to get started. You will also meet with your manager to discuss: 
1. Within 3 days of starting at GitLab, you will receive an email giving you access to [Command of the Message (CoM)](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/) e-learning materials. CoM is our value-driven conversation framework that will be covered during SQS.
1. During your second week, the Sales Enablement Team will send you a calendar invite for the upcoming SQS as well as an email prompting you to log in to Google Classroom to begin working through the [Sales Quick Start learning path](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/onboarding/sales-learning-path/). Connect with your manager to arrange travel for SQS or if you are unable to attend the next session.
1. Within a week of attending SQS, you will receive access to the 13-week Command of the Message Fast Start program.
1. In your first few weeks you will receive access to your Sales Development Technical Development training. This is to be completed within your first 180 days and ties directly to SDR [progression](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#graduating-from-sales-development-onboarding).
### Graduating from Sales Development Onboarding

If the related SDR relays information that was not picked up in the new SDR’s research, the new SDR should end any active Groove Flow if the prospect hasn’t engaged and change lead ownership to the team member who has been engaged so they can reach out. If the new SDR has engaged with the prospect, there will need to be a coordinated handoff worked out between the new SDR and the related SDR. Note: Only activity logged in SFDC will be recognized as activity.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
### General Sales Dev Trouble-shooting
**Q:** I can’t see certain Groove collections!:
**A:** You potentially were added to the incorrect Sales Dev Team in Groove. Please reach out to Sales Dev Operations.
**Q:** My version of Salesforce seems very basic…:
**A:** Make sure you are using the Sales version of Salesforce. To check, please go to the top right corner of your Salesforce window and click the blue button with the drop down window. From there select “Sales”.
**Q:** I have not received access to all of my tools and it has been a week.
**A:** Notify your manager and have them comment on your Onboarding Role Entitlements Issue.
**Q:** I have uploaded more leads from ZoomInfo than what are showing up in my Salesforce ZoomInfo Lead View.
**A:** This most likely due to these leads aleady being in our Salesforce. The problem is that they are listed as a contact in Salesforce and will only appear in your ZoomInfo Contacts view rather than your Zoominfo Lead view.
**Q:** I do not know what this person did to score as an MQL.
**A:** First check the last interesting moment description on Salesforce and then check the Scoring tab of the Marketo Sales Insight widget that is also on the Salesforce lead page. If no points were allocated to behavior and only to demographic type information please Slack the Marketing Ops group so they are aware that this lead did not take any new action.
**Q:** I received a personal data subject request by a prospect.
**A:** Our MOPs team has set up a process to address any data subject requests for deletion or access to data. If you receive a request for deletion or access to data, please re-direct inquiries to the [Personal Data Subject Request](https://support.gitlab.io/personal-data-request/).
**Q:** Why are BDRs no longer the Account Owner in SFDC?
**A:** BDRs are no longer listed as the account Owner in SFDC to improve Sales Dev and Sales visibility across all prospects/accounts (excluding PubSec). If you want to filter to see just your accounts, please use the ‘BDR Assigned’ field.
**Q:** A prospect said they were going to buy through our website (known as a Web Direct). How can I tell if they did?
**A:** SDRs get credit for opportunities where the SDR had meaningful two way communication with a prospect 60 days before they bought GitLab through our website. The best way to search for a web direct opportunity is to use [this report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004dkX4). First, set the date range to the time you think the prospect would have bought. Next, find the opportunity that is tied to your prospect’s account. Then follow the process to request SAO credit. **Note: Sometimes someone else from your prospect’s company actually made the GitLab purchase, leading to the opportunity being related to them instead.**
**Q:** How do I request credit for a web direct opportunity?
**A:** On the opportunity record in Salesforce, compose a new Chatter message that includes the following:
1. Tag a member of the Operations Team (Ramona Elliott or Ed Bao) or the Director of Global Commercial Sales Development (Brian Tabbert). **Do not tag Sales Support Yourself**
1. Include a link to the record in Salesforce that shows your related two-way activity in the past 60 days. If your related activity is a phone call, you must have entered the details of the phone call into the Qualification Notes field on the lead record at the time of the call in order for it to be considered. Qualification Notes entered after the Web Direct opportunity has been created will not be considered for credit.
1. Explain how you influenced their decision to purchase GitLab (helped with evaluation, uncovered a need, provided value, etc) The Operations team and/or Director will review the information and decide whether SAO credit is warranted. If confirmed, they will Chatter Sales Support to add you to the opportunity. If rejected, they will communicate to you the reasoning for their decision.
### RoE Common Questions
**Q:** Should BDRs flag duplicate accounts?
**A:** Yes. However, they do not have the ability to merge it themselves so should chatter @Sales Support to do it.
**Q:** How do we resolve a dispute over SAO credit?
**A:** SDR and BDR first try to talk through a solution If no agreement: Managers will determine a solution If no agreement between the managers: Escalate to Senior Leadership Double credit nor double compensation will be given
**Q:** Who will be handling inquiries from an SDR/BDR standpoint?
**A:** Inquiries will go to an open queue. SDR’s will not work them. We want to give marketing time to progress these to MQLs.
**A:** BDR’s can work leads in all statuses if they are related to their “Actively working” accounts. Outreach to these leads would be part of their account strategy.
**Q:** What if a prospect comes back directly to the BDR much delayed, when the account is not marked as “Actively Working” anymore, but resulting from personalized messaging?
**A:** Yes, if they email, reply via LI, or call the BDR directly, the BDR will need to check that the lead is in queue ownership. If so, they must move the account back to “Actively Working”, so that the lead can be put into their ownership.
**Q:** Why are my leads being reassigned to Inquiry Queue?
**A:** Marketing Operations has a daily scheduled clean at 10:30 PM EST/EDT that update Status = Inquiry to Inquiry Queue. To prevent the reassignment, you’ll want to update the leads from Inquiry to Accepted or add to an Groove Flow.
**Q:** What should BDRs do when a prospect or contact responds with a complince related question or objects to being contacted?
**A:** Immediately reach out to the Privacy Team via #privacy-team-help and forward any email from the contact to [dpo@gitlab.com](mailto:dpo@gitlab.com).
**Q:** How do I know if a lead is associated to a Partner Account and is being worked by a Partner? **A:** Partner leads will not be asigned to BDRs or SDRs as they will be assigned to the Partner Queue. To tell whether a lead is associated to a Partner Account, check their `Vartopia Partner Account` - if it’s empty, you are may proceed with outreach.
**Q:** When a partner lead is assigned to Partner, when and how can we recall the lead? **A:** Partner lead will be recalled after a certain period of time if they are not accepted by Partners for joint marketing campaigns. They will be initially be recalled with a Recycle status, once they become MQL, they will be assigned to BDRs or SDRs. For more information on this process, see the [Vartopia handbook page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/vartopia/#partner-recall).

### Sales Dev Career Path
[Unsupported block type: table]
### Sales Dev Performance Management Process
The Sales Development organization believes in getting the job done (consistently delivering results) and doing it right (meeting KPI/SLAs, adhering to [Our Three Pillars](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars), and being good partners both internally and externally). Our performance management process is deeply rooted in this philosophy. As we are building high-performing teams, it is important to understand that while we expect results, we also have expectations surrounding how we get to those results. Therefore, a performance management process will be initiated if a team member is not meeting their performance targets and/or is not adhering to their KPIs/SLAs. The idea behind our framework is to address issues promptly to ensure the long-lasting success of all team members.
The sections below will provide more details as to the performance management process on quota attainment as well as [Our Three Pillars](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars) and KPIs/SLAs for inbound leads and outbound account management. While regular coaching is expected in weekly 1:1s, informal performance management will be initiated if a ramped team member has two consecutive months below 75-80%* attainment (SAOs, Stage 1 XDR Net ARR or Stage 3 Net ARR).
- *Range due to varied quotas*
### SAOs and Stage 1 XDR Net ARR
Once the team member is informed, expectations will be:
- Month 1: 75-80% attainment + adherence to [Our Three Pillars](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars)
- Month 2: 75-90% attainment + adherence to [Our Three Pillars](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars)
- Month 3 and beyond: 100% attainment + adherence to [Our Three Pillars](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars)
Should the team member fall short of the targets above, a formal warning will be issued. After the formal warning is issued if the team member falls short of targets again, additional disciplinary action could be taken up to and including termination.
### Stage 3 Net ARR
As a business we understand that Stage 3 Net ARR is a metric that can take time to influence. We are viewing Stage 3 Net ARR attainment as an indicator of healthy pipeline generation. Two consecutive months below monthly quota attainment suggests potential issues. Stage 3 Net ARR is a direct consequence of Stage 1 Net ARR. Therefore, performance management will focus on what can be immediately influenced by a team member: Stage 1 Net ARR (not Stage 1 XDR Net ARR stamped amounts, but real opportunity value: Stage 1 Net ARR).
The process, however, will stay the same: once the team member is informed, expectations will be:
- Month 1: 80% attainment + adherence to [Our Three Pillars](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars)
- Month 2: 90% attainment + adherence to [Our Three Pillars](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars)
- Month 3 and beyond: 100% attainment + adherence to [Our Three Pillars](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars)
Effective in FY26, Net ARR generated from a Focus Account New Logo (First Order or New Connected) will be counted twice toward this attainment.
Should the team member fall short of the targets above, a formal warning will be issued. After a formal warning is issued if the team member falls short of targets again, additional disciplinary action could be taken up to and including termination.

### Inbound Lead Management
The below apply for all inbound-related leads for both the SDR and BDR teams. Please note that, other than [SFDC lead views](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#where-to-find-your-leads-and-accounts), inbound MQLs will also be flagged to you in a dedicated Slack alert channel. The official tracking of SLA times is done on SFDC, but you will also find an ‘Acknowledge’ button on the Slack notification that you can press so that it helps with daily check-ins with your Manager.

### PTO and Flexible Working
### Sales Development Organization Time Off
In accordance with the [Time Off Policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off), you need give your manager a heads up early of your intended time off so that they can help arrange cover for your tasks, if necessary.
We want to help our team members being able to fully unplug from work during their PTO, while not having to worry about their workload or target attainment. Based on this, we have created this PTO Territory Planning Issue that you can use to strategize your work and be aligned to the GitLab value of being a [Manager of One.](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#managers-of-one)
To log a PTO Territory Planning request, please go to the Issue list on the SDR GitLab project [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sdr/-/issues/new) and choose `PTO_Coverage_Template` from the Description drop-down list. All of these requests are then managed through the board here. and all next steps and guidelines are on the issue description.
### Flexible working
At GitLab we have flexible working hours. This means that you can organize your working day as you like and are not expected to arrive and leave at a set time every day, but we do expect MQL’s to be followed up within 1 hour (during business hours) so communication with your manager will be necessary if you plan to be out for an extended period of time. Managers will provide direction on the routing of leads during that time.
With a prospect-facing role in Sales Development, do keep in mind when you are calling and emailing prospects:
- The best times to call are early and late in the business day, so these may be best blocked for this activity.
- Groove allows you to schedule emails at set times. For outbound prospecting, the most effective emails are those that come in the early morning and early evening, so you can take advantage of this feature. On the other hand, inbound MQL’s must be handled regularly throughout your day as they come in.
- Lunchtimes are good for outreach as most prospects have meeting blocks for three hours in the morning and then two hours mid-afternoon.
- The above blocks you can use for account research and planning, customer meetings, or meetings with your sales reps, manager, peers, and teams.
- Although you are not expected to start work and end work at the same time every day, please do keep in mind the normal business hours of your prospects, and make sure to schedule your own working hours to ensure you maximize opportunities.
In short, working at GitLab means that if you start the day early you can take a long lunch break to hit the gym or go grocery shopping in the middle of the day when it’s quiet, yet you can still do a full day’s work around that and don’t need to be accountable all the time, as long as you are available to call prospects and be available for prospect meetings during normal working hours for your region/territory.
