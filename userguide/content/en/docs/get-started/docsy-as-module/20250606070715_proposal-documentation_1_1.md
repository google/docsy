### 2. Presentation Deck

- Content: A concise PowerPoint or Keynote presentation summarising the proposal’s key points. This should visually highlight your value proposition, services, project timeline, and expected outcomes.

### Additional Considerations

- Personalisation: Tailor each output to the specific client, reflecting their branding where appropriate, to create a personalised experience.

- Clarity and Brevity: Ensure all documents are clear, concise, and free of jargon, making them easily understandable for all stakeholders involved.

### Delivery Method

- Email or File Sharing: Send the proposal package via email or a secure file-sharing platform, ensuring that the client receives all outputs in one comprehensive package.

- Follow-Up: Schedule a follow-up call or meeting to discuss the proposal and answer any questions the client may have.

By providing these key outputs, you will help ensure that the client has all the necessary information to make an informed decision and will see the value that Green Orbit Digital can bring to their sustainability-focused marketing efforts.
