<details markdown="1">

<summary>Eligibility</summary>

Any active, regular, full-time team member working a minimum of 30 hours per week are eligible for all benefits. Benefits are effective on your date of hire. Others eligible for benefits include:

- Your legal spouse or domestic partner,
- Your dependent children up until age 26 (including legally adopted and stepchildren), and/or
- Any dependent child who reaches the limiting age and is incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical disability

Note: If you and an eligible dependent (as defined above) are both employed by GitLab, you may only be covered by GitLab's coverage once. This also applies to enrolling in either your own supplemental life insurance or supplemental spouse/dependent life insurance through your dependent who is employed by GitLab, but not both.

A domestic partnership is an arrangement in which two people live together and are in a committed relationship without being legally married. Domestic partnerships are composed of two people of any gender, which includes male, female, or nonbinary people. If you have recently entered in to a Domestic Partnership, or your Domestic Partner goes through a Qualifying Life Event, you may add them to the GitLab plans as outlined in the instructions below. During the documentation step, you will be asked to fill out and submit a [Domestic Partner Affidavit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11cV-WXJXu8G626muav2aJvpYS4CMleeE/view?usp=sharing) in to PlanSource. If you are adding your Domestic Partner during New Hire Enrollment or Open Enrollment, there is no need to fill out the Domestic Partnership Affidavit.

 **Please note that a portion of the premiums paid by GitLab and any portion of the premium paid by salary deduction for a Domestic Partner may be included in the employee's reported gross income for tax purposes. Additionally, premium contributions for Domestic Partner coverage may not be eligible for pre-tax salary reduction under Section 125.**

#### Qualifying Life Events

You must wait until the event date has passed to submit your Qualifying Life Event. You have ***30 days from the date of your qualifying event*** to submit your requested change to PlanSource.

Once approved, coverage will be backdated to the date of the event.

Potential joiners who do not have a myCigna account yet can search for providers on the [Cigna Website](https://hcpdirectory.cigna.com/web/public/consumer/directory/plan-selection). When selecting a plan everyone at GitLab (PPO, EPO, and HDHP members) will use the OPEN ACCESS PLUS selection, except for Utah members, who will use the PPO option.

Team Members and potential joiners can also reach out to the [Cigna One Guide service](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eIvtYtYPSt3Q0h-Byd16CFFfT0bxv8yF/view?usp=sharing) to check if their doctors are in-network and walk through the GitLab plans with a Cigna rep.

{{% alert title="Important Note" color="warning" %}}
As an additional measure to confirm "Contracted Providers" (i.e. In-Network), it's always a good idea to follow up with Providers directly (phone, email or otherwise) to additionally confirm if a Provider is contracted with Cigna or not and if the type of service is covered. In some instances, the same provider may be covered In-Network for certain types of services, but may be Out-Network for other services.
Provider contracts change and sometimes the contracts change faster than the website maintenance teams for the insurance carriers. It's better to spend time researching and confirming rather than assuming and being stuck with *balance billing* from Out of Network providers.
*Balance billing* is if the Out of Network provider's charge is $100 and the carrier's maximum allowed reimbursement (MAR) amount is $70, the provider is within rights to bill you for the remaining $30. A "Cigna Contracted Provider" cannot balance bill Cigna members.

</details>

<details markdown="1">

<summary>GitLab Process for Disability Claims</summary>

1. Team Members unable to work due to disability, as defined by the applicable short-term disability plan, should contact the Absence Management team (leaves@gitlab.com) as soon as possible.  See [Sick Time reporting procedures in the US](/handbook/people-group/paid-time-off/#sick-time-procedures---usa).
1. The Absence Management team will complete the Employer portion of the [Short-Term disability](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1guydUTEc0vBFMaa_IsSktZ5hXAbOXdvD/view?usp=sharing) application and email the completed portion along with the [Assignment of Benefits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nd0r5qj9PS21HDFH97Jbft9dZzlpTOsr/view?usp=sharing) form.
1. At the end of the maximum benefit period for short-term disability of 12 weeks, the team member will determine whether they are able to return back to work.
   - If the team member intends to return on or before the end of the 12 weeks, they should email leaves@gitlab.com a Return to Work authorization form from their physician stating that they are able to return to work and listing any accommodations needed, if applicable, at least 5 calendar days before their return date. The Absence Management team will request this at least 5 business days before the team member's anticipated return to work date if not already provided by the team member.
   - If the team member is unable to return, the team member will be moved to unpaid leave and will have the option to continue their benefits by electing [COBRA coverage](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/cobra-continuation-coverage.pdf). The team member will be eligible to apply for long-term disability at this time.

</details>

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Short-Term Disability Claim Process via NYLife</summary>

1. Team member will submit the Claimant portion of the [Short-Term Disability](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1guydUTEc0vBFMaa_IsSktZ5hXAbOXdvD/view?usp=sharing) application and remit to their physician to complete the rest.
     - The completed application can be sent directly to NYLife (using the mail or fax number at the top of the form) or can be returned to the Absence Management team and will be submitted on the team member's behalf.
     - This is completely at the preference of the team member or the requirement from the doctor, but the team member should confirm the choice with the Absence Management team.
1. If the team member opts to send the form directly to NYLife, the Absence Management team will email the completed employer portion of the Short-Term Disability form to NYLife via email: `GBSIntakePaper@newyorklife.com`.
1. NYLife Claims Process:
     - Within 3 business days of NYLife receiving the claim, their claims team will contact the team member to gather additional medical or eligibility data, if needed.
     - The claims team will also contact the Absence Management team to confirm eligibility and verify job responsibilities, if needed.

### 401(k) Match

GitLab offers matching 50% of contributions on the first 6% of allocated gross earnings per pay period with a yearly cap of $1,500 USD. If a hypothetical team member's salary is $50,000 USD, their gross pay per period is $50,000 / 24 = $2083.33. This is then matched at a rate of $2083.33 \* 6% \* 50% = $62.50.

Employer match contributions will automatically vest when received.

As you are eligible to participate in GitLab's 401(k) as of your hire date, you are *also* eligible for GitLab matching contributions as of your hire date.

All employer contributions are pre-tax contributions. Team members can still make Roth 401(k) team member contributions and receive pre-tax employer contributions to your Traditional 401(k) account.

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Administration of 401(k) Match</summary>

- The employer will use the calculation on each check date effective as of January 1.
- The team member must have a contribution for a check date to be eligible for the employer match.
- Employer matching will be released into participant accounts three business days after the check date.
- For team members who defer more than 6% on each check date, an annual true-up will be conducted after calendar year end.
- The 401(k) match runs calendar year.

#### Health Savings Account (HSA)

GitLab contributes $100 per month for those enrolled in the HSA under Individual cover, and $125 per month under team member + dependent(s) cover. You must be enrolled in the HDHP plan in order to contribute to the HSA.

</details>

<details markdown="1">

<summary>HSA Details</summary>

Your HSA account allows you to set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay for qualified medical expenses. By using untaxed dollars in an HSA to pay for deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and some other expenses, you may be able to lower your out-of-pocket health care costs. Some benefits of on HSA account are:

Your HSA contributions go into your account before taxes. The money you save to your HSA lowers your taxable income – so you may pay less in taxes.
Money in your HSA account earns tax-free interest.
Any unused HSA funds roll over to the next year.  The money is yours forever. It doesn't expire.
You can spend your HSA dollars on eligible health care expenses, or save and invest them for the future.
Once your HSA account hits a certain balance, you can invest a portion of your HSA balance in mutual funds, stocks and bonds.
You can use your HSA to save for retirement. At age 65, you can use the funds for any purpose without a penalty. The money you take out to pay for eligible health care expenses continues to be tax free. You also can take money out for other reasons without paying a penalty.

</details>

<details markdown="1">

<summary>HSA Account Rollover & Administration</summary>

If you would like to transfer your HSA from a previous account, please contact WEX (Discovery) and request a HSA Transfer funds form. On the form you will put your old HSA provider's account number and any other required personal information. You will then submit the form to WEX (Discovery), and they will get in contact with your old HSA provider and process the transfer of funds. You can reach WEX (Discovery) at 866.451.3399 or `customerservice@discoverybenefits.com`.

HSAs roll over completely year-to-year and are 'owned' by the team member. If you leave GitLab and would like to keep your HSA account, GitLab will no longer be responsible for the administration fee. The account holder will become responsible for the per month admin fee.

Domestic Partner Reimbursements: If the team member is not legally married to their domestic partner, the domestic partner's expenses are not eligible for disbursement from the HSA. However, if the domestic partner is covered under the family HDHP through the team member, the domestic partner can open their own HSA and contribute up to the full family contribution maximum. The team member may also contribute up to the full family contribution maximum to their own HSA.

</details>

</details>

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Health Savings Account and Offboarding GitLab </summary>

## COBRA

If you are enrolled in medical, dental, and/or vision when you terminate from GitLab (either voluntarily or involuntarily), you may be eligible to continue your coverage through [COBRA](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/cobra-continuation-coverage.pdf).

<summary>COBRA Timeline</summary>

1. Typically terminations are updated in Workday on the date of the termination and once updated, will then be updated in PlanSource by the end of the next business day.
1. Once the termination has been added to PlanSource, the information will then be sent over to [WEX (Discovery Benefits)](https://cobra.discoverybenefits.com/), our COBRA administrator. The file feeds over every Wednesday morning. Government guidelines give 30 days for WEX (Discovery) to be notified of the COBRA eligibility, but typically this will take about 1-2 weeks.
1. Once notified, WEX (Discovery) has 14 days to generate and send the COBRA enrollment packet. Allow normal mailing timelines (5-10 business days) to receive the packet once sent. You may also contact `total-rewards@ gitlab` at least a week after your termination date and we can send an electronic copy of your COBRA enrollment packet to you if it has been generated.
1. You will have 60 days from the time you receive the COBRA packet to enroll either through the mail or online. Instructions for how to enroll will be included in your COBRA packet. Coverage will be retro-effective to the date coverage was lost.
1. From the day you enroll, you have 45 days to bring your payments to current.
1. You may remain on COBRA for up to 18 months. Please see the COBRA enrollment packet for information on extending COBRA an additional 18 months, if applicable. The state you reside in may allow for additional time on COBRA, but may be more expensive and include only Medical. Please consult the laws for your state for more information.

If you are currently employed and have any general COBRA questions, feel free to contact the Compensation & Benefits team. If you have terminated already or have specific questions on the administration of COBRA, feel free to contact WEX (Discovery) Benefits directly: (866) 451-3399.
