### How to get reimbursed for out-of-pocket spend
Import business transactions paid in cash or charged to a personal card to receive reimbursement through the Navan mobile app. Known as manual expensing, these transactions will be automatically approved for reimbursement if they comply with your assigned policy. Transactions outside of your assigned policy are submitted for review by your company’s admin team.
There are several ways to submit for reimbursement, and all manual expenses can be saved as a draft before submitting:
- **Receipt scanner:** Take or upload a photo of your receipt, and all relevant details will auto-populate into the corresponding fields.
- **Personal card import:** Link your personal card(s) and import transactions for reimbursement. 
- **Type in expenses:** Manually type in your transaction details if you cannot link a personal card or have misplaced your receipt.
- **Receipt Import:** Email Navan ([*receipts@navan.com*](mailto:receipts@navan.com)) a copy of your receipt(s) and they will automatically be added to an existing Navan Expense transaction or created as a transaction draft.
**IMPORTANT NOTE**
- Receipts need to be forwarded from your GitLab email to [*receipts@navan.com*](mailto:receipts@navan.com) in order to be attached to your Navan Expense account. After sending the email, the receipt should show up within a few minutes to a few hours.
### Tip
After beginning a manual expense, tap `Save & close` to save the transaction as a draft. Drafts are saved in the `Drafts` folder and can be accessed and modified at any time until you submit or delete them.
### Receipt Scanner
To upload a receipt, tap `+New transaction`, then `Scan a receipt`. Upload or take a picture of the receipt. For information on uploading multiple receipts for the same transaction, check the [*How to attach multiple receipts to the same transaction*](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/navan-expense-guide/#how-to-attach-multiple-receipts-to-the-same-transaction) section.

### Change expense type
Expense types for transactions charged to Navan cards will be automatically assigned based on the merchant where the card is used. However, you must still confirm that the transaction is assigned to the correct expense type. If you submit an expense with the incorrect expense type, your transaction may be flagged for review by your approver. From there, they will determine whether the transaction can be approved as is or sent back to you to assign the correct expense category. If you need to re-assign the transaction to a different expense type, follow the steps below:

- Tap `Save` to save your changes.
### Add or Edit a General Ledger (GL) Code
GitLab uses GL codes to map and track spend for specific types of expenses. If the system admins have provided you with the ability to add or edit the GL code associated with your transaction, you will be able to do so at the time you are submitting your transaction (for manual/out-of-pocket expenses). To add or edit a GL code, find the appropriate transaction and follow the steps below:
- On the transaction details page, tap the `GL code` field.
- Search for a GL code or scroll through the list provided.

- On the transaction details page, tap the `Trip` field.
- Navan Expense will provide a list of suggested trips booked in Navan for you to select from.
- Once a trip has been selected, tap `Save` to save your changes.

If you submit a manual transaction for an out-of-pocket expense that is not compliant with your assigned expense policy, it will be flagged for review by your expense approver. These transactions will be marked as `In review` and can be found in the `Manual` folder of the `My Transactions` section. If you would like to withdraw one of these transactions before your approver has taken action, you may do so by following the steps below:

### How to itemize a transaction in Navan Expense
Navan Expense provides you with the ability to automatically split a single transaction into multiple items, allowing for the assignment of expense types, GL codes, custom fields, and the approval or rejection of the transaction by the admin on a per-item basis. A common use case for itemization is hotel expenses, where certain charges should be covered by GitLab (i.e. the hotel’s nightly rate or parking cost) while others should be covered with your personal funds (i.e. spa services utilized at the hotel).
Users can itemize their own manual transactions at any time **before they have been submitted** or after submission only if a transaction has been flagged for review by the system admin and has not yet been actioned by them.
**IMPORTANT NOTE**
- Transaction itemization is not currently available on the web app.
### Itemizing a manual transaction

### How to submit a mileage reimbursement request

- Lastly, enter in your `Date of travel` (required) and any additional details to provide your Navan Expense Admin team with more details and context for your expense (optional).

### Repayments for Out-of-policy Expenses
Transactions charged to a physical Navan Expense card that violate the expense policy assigned to you by GitLab will be reviewed by the Accounts Payable team. Once reviewed, the approver may choose to reject the expense and request that you repay the company for the full transaction amount or a partial amount. Alternatively, if you are aware that a transaction will require repayment, you can make a payment before your approver reviews the transaction. Repayments can be processed directly through the Navan mobile app.

Note that they’ll need to [delegate you with access to their account](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/navan-expense-guide/#designating-delegate-access-to-another-team-member) first.
1. You will then be able to review any transactions submitted, including their teams’ transactions if that user is a manager.
### Managing transactions for another user
- Manual transactions: Manual transactions submitted for reimbursement will fall under one of four review categories (accessed under `Transactions`). If a transaction requires further action, such as requests for more information, a missing receipt, or repayment to the company for partially or fully rejected submissions, you can take action by logging in as the user as outlined in the above section.
- Navan card transactions: Transactions charged on a user’s physical Navan card will be auto-approved if they are compliant with that user’s assigned expense policy. Transactions that are not auto-approved may require additional action, such as providing more information, attaching a missing receipt, or repaying the company if the transaction has been partially or fully rejected. If a transaction requires further action, you can complete any required information by logging in as the user as outlined in the above section.

### Leveraging the Navan Expense manager dashboard (available in the desktop browser only)
The Navan Expense Manager Dashboard gives managers an at-a-glance view of their direct reports’ transaction activity and spend data, as well as the ability to review and approve transactions (for managers designated as expense approvers). The manager dashboard can be accessed from the Navan desktop browser by clicking on the main dropdown menu on the left, then `Manager` under the Expense section. The page has four main components and filters to narrow your search.
**Activity**
The Activity tab provides an overview of all transaction activity. Choose `Navan Expense transactions` to view all activity from Navan physical cards and virtual cards, or select `Manual transactions` to view all expenses submitted for reimbursement.
**Analysis**
The Analysis section of the Navan Expense Dashboard provides an overview of their company’s business spend including transactions charged to a Navan Expense physical, virtual, and purchase card, as well as transactions submitted for manual reimbursement. Managers can use this information to:
- Group and visualize total spend and number of transactions.
- View a breakdown of different charge types (i.e. physical card vs. manual transaction) to see which methods are being used to submit expenses.
- Filter data across different time frames, groups, and issuing currencies.
Use the `Filters` at the top of the page to adjust the `Spend overview`. You have the ability to filter by time period, group, expense type, issuing currency, individual user, and more.
To access the dashboard, navigate to `Navan Travel > Manager > Analysis`. The `Overview` page will display your company’s total spend categorized by charge type. Charge types are the different ways that employees can submit an expense in Navan Expense. You will see a breakdown of each (if applicable):
- **Physical Cards:** The total posted amount and number of transactions charged on Navan physical cards.
- **Virtual Cards:** The total posted amount and number of transactions for travel spend charged on Navan virtual cards.
- **Manual Transactions:** The total amount and number of approved transactions submitted manually for out-of-pocket expenses.
**Users**
The Users tab allow managers to view their direct reports’ employee data such as their issuing currency, cost center, and more. Click on a user’s name to view additional information including their transaction history and policy assignment. In addition to the Activity tab, designated approvers can review, approve, reject, and request more information for a transaction directly through a user’s transaction history.
### Note
Users designated as a manager on the Navan user list will have access to the Manager Dashboard. If you do not see a Manager Dashboard option available, either you do not have any assigned direct reports or your direct reports do not have any spend activity.

## Navan Expense Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
### What happens if I enter incorrect bank account information?
Account information is validated upon submission. However, we cannot validate that it is the correct account for you. Please ensure that you enter your bank account information correctly. Navan is not liable for money sent to the wrong account.
### What if I have a bank account transacted in currency outside of those supported?
If your bank account’s currency is not currently supported or you wish to not link your bank account for other reasons, you can still receive reimbursements through GitLab’s payroll. For details on GitLab’s payroll cycle and process, contact the Accounts Payable Team.
### What if I don’t want to link my personal card? How can I make repayments to my company?
If you do not link your personal card to Navan Expense and you owe GitLab a repayment for an expense that was not approved, you will need to connect with the Accounts Payable Team to determine the best method for repayment.
### In what countries are direct reimbursements available?
Please check [this section](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#44-reimbursement-payout-timelines) of the Expense handbook page for information on reimbursements and payout timelines.
### How can I receive my funds if my reimbursement fails?
If your reimbursement fails, unlink, then relink your bank account from the `My reimbursements` tab on your mobile app or the `Settings` tab on the web app. Once relinked, Navan will resend the funds to your bank.
### Is it required that I include participants on my transactions?
While it is not required, adding participants to your transactions will give your Admin Team a better understanding of cost per person and help provide justification for more costly expenses.
### If I add colleagues to my transaction as participants, whose policy will be applied?
Adding participants to a transaction will not affect which policy is applied. Any transactions that you submit, regardless of participants entered, will be subject to the parameters set by your own assigned policies.
### Is it possible to expense mileage for a round trip drive?
Yes, simply click on the `+` icon when entering your destinations to add a location.
### Will I be able to submit for reimbursement in kilometers instead of miles?
The region assigned to you by your Navan Expense Admin Team will determine if you are able to submit in kilometers or miles. **Note:** If you are a US-based employee using your personal car on an international trip, you will still need to submit your reimbursement request in miles.
### Can I still submit mileage for travel, without attaching it to a trip booked on Navan?
Yes, as long as your assigned expense policy allows for mileage reimbursement.
### What rideshare applications can Navan connect to?
Navan offers connections with Lyft, Uber, and Grab so you can automatically share your location and destination information to access a ride while traveling.
> 
### Can I automatically submit Lyft expenses?
Navan Expense users can connect their Lyft account to Navan Expense to automatically send receipts and submit expenses for business travel-related Lyft rides. To leverage this option, you will first need to create a Lyft business profile with the same email address you use in Navan.
> 
### Is there anything I can’t do in the web app that I can do in the mobile app?
To view your assigned expense policies or log miles driven for reimbursement, please use the Navan app. These features are not currently available in the web app.
### Should I add tax details for Navan Expense transactions?
Team members are not required to add tax details to any expense transactions.
> 
### Are multiple receipts auto-approved paid in one lump sum or as separate reimbursements?
A deposit for each transaction will be made into your bank account. If you submit 5 manual expenses, you will receive 5 separate bank deposits for each individual transaction.
### If my expenses are rejected, can I go back to edit and resubmit?
Expenses will need to be fully resubmitted if rejected.
### Where can I see Navan Expense product releases?
Navan Expense product releases are shared in the following blog: [Navan Expense product release announcements](https://app.navan.com/app/helpcenter/articles/expense/admin/general-settings/navan-expense-product-release-announcements)
