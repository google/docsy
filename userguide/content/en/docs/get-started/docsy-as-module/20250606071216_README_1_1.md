# Zammad S/MIME test certificate generation

This folder contains a `docker` image and the required files to generate various S/MIME certificates for testing
purposes. These contain CA certificates as regular certificates (1). There is one special certificate that is for
multiple emails at once (2). Additionally some already expired CA and certificates are generated (3).
For the CA there are `.key` and `.crt` files. For the certificates the `.key`, `.crt` and `.csr` are generated.
Additionally a `.secret` file is added that contains the corresponding passphrase.

These are easily generated by executing the `run.sh` file. There is nothing more to it except of having `docker`
installed and running.
