## Overview

Rattle is primarily used by our Solutions Architects for [activity capture](/handbook/solutions-architects/processes/activity-capture/) to capture customer calls, efficiently log them, and run reporting in Salesforce and our BI tool. Rattle replaced Troops.ai in January of 2024.

1. [How to Set Up a User](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngsPW7J5myQ). Three steps:
   1. Create user in Rattle
   1. Add user to the Okta Rattle Group (https://groups.google.com/a/gitlab.com/g/okta-rattle-users/members)
   1. Ensure the user has integrated their Salesforce account (https://help.gorattle.com/en/articles/6254793-accepting-a-rattle-invite-and-integrating-salesforce)
   1. Add user to their respective *regional* slack channel notification (rattle-activities-region)
   1. Add user to #rattle-users in Slack
   1. All workflows in Rattle are based on Salesforce Role, not the user's name, so there is no action needed on workflows when a new hire starts.
