## Summary

The GitLab Contributors Program drives strategic growth of our open source contributor community to deliver measurable product improvements and a sustainable pipeline of contributing end users.
By converting users into active contributors and then champions of GitLab, we create a scalable model where contributors solve real challenges, deepen their knowledge of GitLab, and tackle larger intiatives that impact millions of users.

The [Contributor Success team](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/contributor-success/) implements targeted outreach strategies to existing GitLab users, customers, learners, and partners to funnel top contributors into the program on the [Contributors platform](https://contributors.gitlab.com/).
The program's dual focus on code and non-code contributions ensures comprehensive platform enhancement, from technical improvements to documentation, translation, design and user experience.

## Key Objectives

1. Reach 200 unique wider community contributors a month by end of FY26
1. Deliver a public portfolio highlighting 10 high-impact contributions each quarter by end of FY26

## KPIs

* [Unique Wider Community Contributors per Month](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/performance-indicators/#unique-wider-community-contributors-per-month)

## Target Audience Segmentation

Our primary focus is engaging GitLab's existing users and customers, who consistently deliver the highest-impact contributions.
We supplement this with targeted outreach to learners and hackathon participants to build a diverse contributor pipeline that drives growth of the community.

### 1. Primary Focus: GitLab Users and Customers

* Highest potential for meaningful contributions due to platform experience and issues to scratch
* Training customer contributors through Co-Create

  * Targeted outreach of contribution opportunities for all GitLab end users
* Utilize ecosystem partners and hyperscalers to accelerate innovative changes
  * Collaborate with GitLab's Strategy & Ecosystem teams

### 2. Supporting Pools

### Operating Principles

#### Marketing and Strategy Alignment

Applying GitLab's Marketing & Strategy principles will grow our contributor community while delivering measurable value.
In FY26 we adopt the existing [Marketing Alignment](/handbook/marketing/#marketing-alignment) stages into our contributor strategy: Awareness => Consideration => Conversion => Expansion => Evangelism.

* **Contributor Journey Focus**
  * Guide users from awareness of contribution opportunities to converting active contributors who advocate for contributing to GitLab
  * Create targeted content and outreach dependent on stage of the contributor journey and target audience
  * Measure and optimize our outreach strategies to improve conversion rates

* **Value-Driven Community Growth**
  * **Collaboration:** Foster collaborations between contributors, internal teams, customers, and partners
  * **Results:** Track and communicate concrete metrics showing community growth and contributor impact on product improvement
  * **Efficiency:** Streamline contributor onboarding, support processes, and AI workflows to reduce barrier of entry
  * **Diversity, inclusion and belonging:** Actively cultivate diverse contributor perspectives globally and support first-time contributors
  * **Iteration:** Apply user studies and contributor surveys to refine high impact areas and stumbling blocks to the contributor journey
  * **Transparency:** Maintain open communication with the community and better inform internal teams of strategies and results

* **Stakeholder Engagement**
  * "Market" ourselves to internal stakeholders by showcasing how the program supports community contributors to improve the GitLab product for end users
  * Align contributor initiatives with company OKRs and strategic priorities
  * Build strong partnerships across internal teams to amplify our strategies, results and ways team members can support community contributors

#### Efficiency and Iteration with "Good Enough" Mindset

We embrace GitLab's values of efficiency and iteration by prioritizing progress over perfection.
This approach ensures we maintain program momentum while maximizing our impact on the contributor community and GitLab platform.

* **Strategic Prioritization**
  * Focus on high-impact improvements that deliver essential value quickly
  * Advance projects when they reach 80% effectiveness, allowing us to tackle more initiatives
  * Reserve deep iteration for areas directly impacting KPIs or program scalability
