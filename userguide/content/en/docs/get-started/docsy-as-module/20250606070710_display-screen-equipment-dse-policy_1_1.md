Green Orbit Digital Display Screen Equipment (DSE) Policy

1. Purpose

Green Orbit Digital is committed to ensuring the health, safety, and well-being of all employees while working with Display Screen Equipment (DSE), including computers, laptops, tablets, and any other technology used for work. This policy is designed to comply with the Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992, which set out legal responsibilities for employers regarding the use of DSE in the workplace.

The goal of this policy is to provide clear guidelines to prevent DSE-related health issues and to promote a productive, healthy working environment.

1. Scope

This policy applies to all employees of Green Orbit Digital who regularly use Display Screen Equipment as part of their job responsibilities, whether they are working in the office or remotely. This includes full-time, part-time, and contract staff.

1. Responsibilities

Employer Responsibilities:

Green Orbit Digital will ensure that DSE is properly maintained and ergonomically set up to reduce risks of injury.

The company will provide relevant training and information to employees regarding the safe use of DSE.

Regular risk assessments will be carried out to identify and address potential DSE hazards.

Employees will be offered a reasonable level of support and adjustments for those with specific health concerns related to DSE use.

Employee Responsibilities:

Employees must use DSE in a manner that minimizes risks to their health.

Employees should report any discomfort, pain, or health issues related to DSE use promptly to their line manager or HR.

Employees should follow the guidance and training provided on proper DSE usage, including recommended posture and regular breaks.

1. Risk Assessment

Green Orbit Digital will conduct regular risk assessments for all DSE workstations. These assessments will include:

Evaluating workstation setup to ensure that desks, chairs, screens, and input devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.) are ergonomically suitable.

Identifying environmental factors such as lighting, temperature, and glare that could affect employee comfort.

Assessing the duration of DSE use and identifying areas for improvement.

Taking into consideration the individual needs of employees who may have specific health conditions that affect their use of DSE.

Risk assessments will be reviewed and updated regularly, especially when employees move desks, new equipment is introduced, or changes in job functions occur.

1. DSE Workstation Setup

To minimise the risk of discomfort and injury, the following ergonomic guidelines must be followed for DSE workstations:

Seating: Employees should use adjustable chairs that provide lumbar support. The chair height should be adjustable, and the seat should be deep enough to provide full support to the thighs.

Desk Setup: The desk should be at a height that allows the forearms to rest comfortably when typing. There should be adequate space for legs and feet to move freely.

Monitor Placement: Screens should be positioned at eye level, so employees do not need to bend their necks up or down to view the screen. A viewing distance of around 50–70 cm is recommended, depending on the screen size.

Keyboard and Mouse: The keyboard and mouse should be placed so that the forearms remain parallel to the ground, and wrists should not be bent while typing. A wrist rest may be provided to ensure neutral wrist positions.

Lighting: Desk areas should have adequate lighting, avoiding glare or reflection on the screen. Task lighting may be used in addition to general lighting.

1. Regular Breaks

Employees should take regular breaks from DSE work to avoid physical strain. The recommended guidance is to take a 5-10 minute break every hour. During these breaks, employees should:

Stand up and stretch their legs.

Perform simple physical exercises, such as shoulder rolls or neck stretches, to alleviate tension.

Look away from the screen to reduce eye strain.

1. Eye Care and Visual Comfort

Employees should follow these best practices to reduce eye strain:

Maintain an appropriate screen brightness level.

Ensure the screen is clean and free from dust or smudges.

Position the screen to avoid glare from windows or overhead lights.

Adjust text size and screen contrast to suit individual needs.

If employees experience eye discomfort or vision problems due to DSE use, they should report this to their manager or HR for further assessment.

1. Remote Working Considerations

For employees working remotely, Green Orbit Digital will support workstation assessments where possible. Employees working from home should follow the same ergonomic guidelines and best practices for their home office setup. Employees who require adjustments or have health concerns related to remote working will be provided with reasonable support and equipment.

1. Training and Support

All employees who regularly use DSE will receive training on the following:

Proper posture and ergonomic practices.

The importance of regular breaks and eye care.

How to report any health concerns or discomfort related to DSE use.

Training will be provided during the employee’s induction process and will be refreshed as needed. Employees will also have access to ongoing support from HR or their line manager regarding any DSE-related issues.

1. Health Monitoring

Employees are encouraged to notify their line manager or HR if they experience any discomfort, pain, or health issues related to DSE use, such as back pain, eye strain, or repetitive strain injuries (RSI). Any concerns raised will be addressed promptly, and appropriate adjustments will be made, including the possibility of further workstation assessments or adjustments.

1. Adjustments and Support for Employees with Health Conditions

Employees with existing medical conditions or those who experience DSE-related health issues may be entitled to reasonable adjustments, including:

Specialist equipment (e.g., ergonomic chairs or mouse alternatives).

Flexible working arrangements (e.g., reduced screen time or flexible hours).

Adjusted workstation setup for maximum comfort.

Employees with specific health needs should discuss this with HR or their manager to identify suitable solutions.

1. Compliance and Review

This policy will be reviewed regularly to ensure its effectiveness and compliance with health and safety regulations. Any changes to the workplace or DSE-related technology will be considered, and updates to the policy will be made as necessary.

1. Conclusion

Green Orbit Digital aims to provide a safe and healthy working environment for all employees who use Display Screen Equipment. By following this policy, we can prevent DSE-related health problems, increase employee comfort, and enhance productivity.
