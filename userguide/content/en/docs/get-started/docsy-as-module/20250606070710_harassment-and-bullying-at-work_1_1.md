Our Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment policies go hand-in-hand, and reflect our commitment to our Equal Opportunities Policy.

We aim to ensure that Wholegrain Digital is a happy place to work; discrimination and harassment will not be tolerated. We want our team members to feel safe, respected and valued.

These policies apply to all team members, contractors, visitors, clients, and anybody else you come into contact with as part of your employment with us.

## What Is Discrimination?

Discrimination is any negative action or attitude directed at another person, due to age, gender or gender reassignment, disability, marital or civil partnership status, pregnancy or maternity, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation.

## What Is Harassment?

Harassment includes, but is not limited to, bullying, intimidation, direct insults, malicious gossip and victimisation. Examples include engaging in frequent or unwanted advances of any nature, sabotaging somebody’s work, spreading rumours about somebody’s personal life, ridiculing or making derogatory comments about another person.

## Legislation

Wholegrain Digital complies with all anti-discriminatory legislation including:

- The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (updated 1986)

- The Equal Pay Act 1970 (updated 1983)

- The Race Relations Act 1976 (amended 2000)

- The Disability Discrimination Act 1995

- Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999

- The Crime and Disorder of Offenders Act 1974

- The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974

- The Human Rights Act 1998

- European directives and regulations

We recognise that legal obligations in relation to discrimination may overlap between different groups, and that some groups do not benefit from legislative protection. We aim to ensure good practice towards all groups.

## Your Working Environment

We’re committed to maintaining a working environment that’s free from harassment and discrimination. We promote dignity and respect for all, and recognise and value all individual differences and contributions to our team. This includes our virtual workspaces such as Slack, Redbooth, Skype, and Hangouts, as well as telephone and in-person conversations.

All team members are responsible for helping us achieve our aims. Specifically, you must not discriminate against or harass other people, including current and former employees, job applicants, clients, contractors, visitors, or colleagues at our offices.

This applies both in and out of the workplace, when dealing with clients, suppliers or other work-related contacts, and on work-related trips, events, conferences, workshops, etc.

## Addressing Harassment or Discrimination

If you’re the victim of harassment or discriminatory behaviour, or you suspect that others are being targeted, please discuss your concerns in private with our Team Administrator, Mohib, or one of the Directors. We take any complaints of this nature extremely seriously.

Complaints can be raised in accordance with our grievance procedure.

We will thoroughly investigate the matter, and determine the appropriate punishment. Breaches of these policies are dealt with under our disciplinary procedure, and could amount to gross misconduct, potentially leading to dismissal without notice.

Please note that some forms of discrimination or harassment, such as certain forms of harassment, are also a criminal offence.
