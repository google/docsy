Green Orbit Digital IT Asset Management Policy

1. Introduction

IT Asset Management (ITAM) at Green Orbit Digital is a key process for efficiently and securely managing technology resources throughout their lifecycle. This guidance outlines the procedures for acquiring, maintaining, and disposing of IT assets. It ensures that assets are properly tracked, managed, and utilised to support business operations while minimising security risks, costs, and environmental impact.

1. Purpose

The purpose of this IT Asset Management guidance is to:

Provide a clear framework for the acquisition, management, and disposal of IT assets.

Ensure that all IT assets are accounted for and used in compliance with security, legal, and regulatory requirements.

Promote cost-efficiency and sustainability by optimising the use of IT assets and extending their useful life wherever possible.

Enhance security by maintaining accurate records and ensuring that all assets are secure from theft, damage, or misuse.

1. Scope

This policy applies to all IT assets within Green Orbit Digital, including:

Computers, laptops, and mobile devices

Servers, storage devices, and networking equipment

Software applications, licenses, and subscriptions

IT peripherals (e.g., printers, scanners, monitors, etc.)

1. Asset Identification and Registration

Asset Tagging: All IT assets must be assigned a unique identifier (asset tag) upon acquisition. This tag should be used to track the asset throughout its lifecycle.

Asset Database: Each IT asset will be entered into the organisation’s asset management system or database, which will record relevant details such as the asset type, serial number, owner, location, status, purchase date, and warranty details.

Regular Audits: Periodic audits will be carried out to ensure all assets are accurately tracked and accounted for.

1. Acquisition and Procurement

Approval Process: All IT asset acquisitions must be approved through the appropriate channels, with justification for the purchase aligned with Green Orbit Digital’s needs and budget.

Vendor Selection: When procuring IT assets, Green Orbit Digital will choose vendors that offer reliable products, warranty services, and competitive pricing. Preference will be given to vendors who align with our sustainability goals and provide energy-efficient, eco-friendly products.

1. Asset Maintenance and Usage

Routine Maintenance: IT assets should be regularly maintained to ensure optimal performance. This includes software updates, security patches, and hardware checks.

Responsible Usage: Employees must use IT assets in accordance with Green Orbit Digital’s policies, particularly concerning security and confidentiality. Access to certain IT assets or systems should be restricted to authorised personnel.

Security Measures: IT assets must be protected by appropriate security measures, including encryption, password protection, and secure networks. Regular backups of critical data should be taken and stored securely.

1. Asset Transfer and Reallocation

Internal Transfers: When IT assets are transferred within the organisation, the asset database should be updated to reflect the change in ownership or location.

Decommissioning and Disposal: When IT assets are no longer needed or have reached the end of their useful life, they must be decommissioned and disposed of in a secure and environmentally responsible manner. Data on devices must be completely wiped before disposal to ensure confidentiality and security.

1. Asset Disposal and Recycling

Environmental Considerations: Green Orbit Digital is committed to sustainability and, when possible, will dispose of IT assets via certified electronic waste recycling companies. Devices that can be refurbished or resold should be repurposed to extend their lifecycle.

Secure Data Deletion: All data must be securely deleted or wiped from devices before disposal to prevent the risk of data leakage or cyber threats. This process should follow industry best practices and be documented.

1. Documentation and Reporting

Asset Records: All assets must be documented throughout their lifecycle, from acquisition to disposal. This includes maintaining accurate records of the purchase, transfer, maintenance, and disposal of assets.

Reporting: Regular reports on IT asset usage, condition, and status will be generated for management review. Any discrepancies or missing assets must be reported immediately to the IT department.

1. Roles and Responsibilities

IT Department: The IT department is responsible for managing the IT asset lifecycle, including procurement, inventory management, maintenance, and disposal. They must ensure that assets are tracked, secure, and in good working condition.

Employees: Employees are responsible for the proper use and care of IT assets assigned to them. They must report any issues or damage to IT assets immediately and follow the organisation’s policies on asset usage.

Procurement Team: The procurement team is responsible for acquiring IT assets and ensuring that purchasing decisions align with Green Orbit Digital’s needs, budget, and sustainability goals.

1. Compliance and Auditing

Green Orbit Digital will regularly audit its IT asset management practices to ensure compliance with this policy and any relevant legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations. Non-compliance will be addressed promptly and may result in corrective actions or disciplinary measures.

1. Review and Updates

This guidance will be reviewed annually or when necessary, in response to changes in organisational needs, technology, or regulatory requirements. Updates to the policy will be communicated to all employees and relevant stakeholders.

1. Conclusion

By adhering to these IT Asset Management guidelines, Green Orbit Digital ensures that its technology resources are efficiently managed, secure, and aligned with the organisation’s business needs and sustainability goals. Proper asset management helps to maximise the value of IT investments, improve operational efficiency, and reduce environmental impact.
