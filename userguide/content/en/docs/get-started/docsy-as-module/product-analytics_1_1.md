## Business Goal

Fast track GitLab to becoming a data-driven organisation by meeting the data needs of the Product team. Specifically:

- Enable Product to measure stage-specific usage activity, including read activity (frontend; a user in GitLab views a page) and write activity (backend; an object is created)
- Track stage-specific health metrics like [SMAU](/handbook/product/performance-indicators/).

## Exit Criteria

- Create a Periscope dashboard for a single stage that measures SMAU and feature use on GitLab.com.
- Ensure we can replicate this for other stages with great documentation.
