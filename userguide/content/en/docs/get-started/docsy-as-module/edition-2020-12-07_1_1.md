### What's New in GitLab üöÄ

The GitLab 13.6 release is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:

- **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk:** With improvements to several dashboards and reports, teams now have more visibility that enables faster decision making. This includes the Full Code Quality Report to help quickly determine which code quality violations are critical to resolve before merging, and updates to the Project Security Dashboard to help stay on top of the real time and historical vulnerability trends. It also includes the ability for GitLab Self-Managed Administrators to see usage trends for popular features such as users, projects, groups, issues, and pipelines over the last 12 months.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** Easily access and collaborate across tools with improved extensibility with popular tools. This includes an enhanced extension with VS Code to insert Snippets, view and comment on merge requests and issues directly from VS Code. In addition, GitLab integrations can now be configured at a group level in addition to instance and project level, helping group owners manage integrations with ease.
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** Getting started with GitLab CI/CD with Amazon Web Services (AWS) is easier than ever now that Auto DevOps has been extended to support AWS, so teams can Auto-Deploy to Amazon EC2 using Auto DevOps without using Kubernetes. Group owners now have more flexibility in configuring a custom default initial branch name for new repositories as opposed to the master branch.

### Team Member Spotlight üî¶

#### [Timm Ideker - Area Sales Manager, ENT West (Global Director, Mid-Market Sales, effective 2021-02-01)](/handbook/company/team/#tideker)

![Timm-Ideker-TMS-Thumb](/handbook/sales/field-communications/field-flash-newsletter/images/TimmIdeker_TMS_thumb.png)

**Where did you grow up, and where are you based now?**

I grew up in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, USA and I settled in Minnesota (after short pitstops through Kansas & Maine) in about 1996. No plans to leave the Land of 10,000 Lakes!

**What is your favorite thing about your job?**

1:1 connectivity to team members is what fills my cup.

**Which of GitLab's Values resonates most with you?**

Everyone can contribute is a mantra but also a call to action; everyone must contribute. There is no cavalry and *we are the experts* who are going to solve some of our client's most difficult challenges.

**Do you have a helpful tip for working at GitLab to share?**

[donut-be-strangers](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#the-donut-bot) is a great slice of technology that connects you to a GitLab team member. I have been doing these random coffee chats every 1-2 weeks since I got here and I always learn something new about another person and / or our business. Highly recommend!

**What is a hobby or skill you have that the team might not know about?**

Is bartending a skill?!? I can also remember nearly all movie dialog.

**Icebreaker: What was the first concert you ever went to?**

Guns N' Roses / Metallica / Body Count at Kansas City Arrowhead Stadium in 1992.
