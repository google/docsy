### What's New in GitLab üöÄ

The GitLab 13.11 release is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:

- **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk:** Security pros will be happy to see that they can now secure the software supply chain even further with support for custom detection rules, custom certificates and email alerts for key expirations. The new On-Call Schedule Management will lay a strong foundation as we mature our security alerts in future releases, providing a valuable incident management capability with end-to-end visibility across the entire DevOps process.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** Teams can grow and scale while simplifying compliance efforts with new controls that keep automation on track, including the GitLab Agent for Kubernetes for .com which supports pull-based deployments that are preferred by security as well as Network Security policy integration and alerts which enables fine-tuned RBAC controls within clusters. Compliant Pipeline Configurations allow customers to enforce a higher degree of separation of duties and reduce business risks, while Admin mode increases security and control of a customer‚Äôs GitLab instance by requiring admin users to reverify their credentials before running administrative commands.
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** 13.11 delivers faster, more reliable pipelines with a host of pipeline improvements. These include enhancements to the Pipeline Editor such as the Empty State enhancement and the ability to configure multiple cache keys in a single job, which helps customers get to work even faster and stay more productive once they begin. It also includes a new DORA 4 graph showing lead time for changes and metrics on DevOps Adoption at the group level.

![Alyssa-Belardi-TMS-Thumb](/handbook/sales/field-communications/field-flash-newsletter/images/Alyssa-Belardi-TMS-Thumb.jpeg)

**Where did you grow up, and where are you based now?**

I grew up in a split household between San Francisco and Tiburon, California. I love the SF Bay Area and have been fortunate enough to stay here for my entire life (except for a short stint living in the Australian bush‚Ä¶ slack me to hear that crazy story) and now reside in Orinda, CA.

**What is your favorite thing about your job?**

Collaborating with various teams to achieve desired results. The most important part of my job is triangulating resources to tell an impactful story, prove the product, provide for and inspire our customers. Without the support of the broader GitLab team, I would most certainly not be able to do my job effectively.

**Which of GitLab's Values resonates most with you?**

Results because I firmly believe one can‚Äôt achieve Results without Collaboration, Iteration, Diversity/Inclusion, Efficiency and Transparency. This GitLab value holds me accountable every day.

**Do you have a helpful tip for working at GitLab to share?**

Don‚Äôt be shy in Slack channels. Using the channels yields incredible responses from multiple sources ‚Äì I‚Äôve learned so much from some of the conversations started with what I thought was a simple question.

**What is a hobby or skill you have that the team might not know about?**

I collect vintage and unique glass items. Vases are my favorite - especially from Sklo Union, Rosenthal Studio and Louise Roe Copenhagen. I adore arranging flowers in special vases around the house, it‚Äôs my simple pleasure to make living itself an art.

**Icebreaker: What was your favorite item of clothing as a kid?**

When I was 8, I loved my red high top Chuck Taylor converse‚Ä¶ they were the best and I wore them until there were holes through the soles. I still love and wear high top chucks today!
