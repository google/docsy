## Retrospective

### VPE

- GOOD
  - We rebuilt the Production team with a concerted recruiting effort
  - The Engineering Handbook refactor went smoothly
  - All sourcing goals were met
  - All hires were made
- BAD
  - Several high-profile DB incidents marred availability of GitLab.com and decreased customer confidence
  - The GCP project was delayed several times in the quarter
- TRY
  - We need to continue the better predictability that the GCP project finished the quarter with and close it out in July
  - We need to continue adding to our production and database teams and implement the new org structure
  - Directors and managers need to take ownership of their handbook sections in Q3 and build them out
  - I need to assist directors with their manager hiring in Q3, as well as their trickiest IC vacancies

### Frontend

- GOOD
  - Made hiring target and onboarded successfully all new hires
  - New Teams inside the Frontend department
  - We shipped the Bootstrap 4 upgrade and the Merge Request Refactoring was finally finished
  - Our done deliverables count is constantly going up
- BAD
  - Hard time with sourcing for roles outside of Frontend
  - Bootstrap Upgrade had too many regressions
  - Too many bumpy development flows (too long until actionable, blocking dependencies, etc.) and late realisation of problems
- TRY
  - Continue Hiring and Team structure transformation
  - Getting better to estimate and especially find stepping stones early
  - Improve workflows, tooling and especially individual planning to get to 100% deliverables

### Dev Backend

- GOOD
  - Two KRs at 100%: Sourcing/hiring + handbook
  - Hire was made quickly from pre-existing applicants, so sourcing was applied
    to future hires
  - Handbook updates spread through quarter, healthy pace for introducing +
    discussing change
- BAD
  - Sourced candidates haven't been contacted - need better pipeline for sourced
    talent
  - Handbook KR wasn't specific enough, had to redefine that halfway through the
    quarter
  - Dashboards didn't ship - too much time waiting on external teams
- TRY
  - Keep KRs from being dependent on other teams as much as possible
  - Ensure KRs are specific and measurable
  - Both of the above are known best practices for KRs. Don't make exceptions to
    known best practices for KRs. :)

### Discussion

- GOOD
  - Made two new hires early in the quarter, putting us ahead of schedule for a while
  - Shipped deliverables at a consistent rate
  - Hiring pool puts us in better shape to hire well across all teams
- BAD
  - Missed hiring target; we also aren't particularly close to making that extra hire soon
  - Missed a particular deliverable (batch commenting) several times
  - Rails 5 spilled over to Q3, but it is much closer now
- TRY
  - Using weight / throughput to keep feature delivery on track
  - [Rotate team expertise more](https://gitlab.com/gl-retrospectives/discussion/issues/3)
  - [Work closer with the frontend team in scheduling](https://gitlab.com/gl-retrospectives/discussion/issues/2)

### Distribution

- GOOD
  - Being very disciplined in scheduling deliverables allowed us to keep our promises.
  - Managed to deliver Helm charts in beta as promised by working in weekly milestones which
  allowed us to change direction quicker based on current status and direction.
  - Introduction of Team Issue Triaging allowed us to keep on top of incoming issues with the omnibus-gitlab issue tracker, and reduce the number of stale issues.
  - Replaced a team member fairly quickly after a departure.
- BAD
  - Team size has reduced which impacted our ability to deliver on Technical Debt and performance improvements.
  - Hiring was impacted by a mismatch in our proposed compensation and real market expectations.
  - Noticeable team fragmentation between two major team projects.
  - No capacity to tackle non-critical projects.
- TRY
  - Reduce team fragmentation by rotating team between projects.
  - Create a stronger candidate pipeline and hit the hiring targets.

### Geo

- GOOD
  - We conducted more than 8 GCP failover rehearsals and improved them each time.
  - We shipped a repository ref checksum features that gave us confidence in the GCP data for 4+ million repositories.
  - We helped improve Geo at scale by fixing numerous bugs with uploads, Wiki, and repository sync.
  - We upgraded GitLab to git 2.16, which turned out to be non-trivial.
  - We shipped HTTP push to the Geo secondary, including Git LFS support.
  - We made significant progress towards supporting SSH push to the Geo secondary.
  - We made progress towards activating hashed storage in production by finding and fixing more bugs in the implementation.
- BAD
  - We missed a number of deliverables due to merge requests in review.
  - We overestimated team capacity due to GCP migration tasks and vacations.
  - We still have database performance issues at scale.
  - We still haven't activated hashed storage in production.
- TRY
  - Nominate another Geo maintainer
  - Reduce the variability of the deliverables scheduled from month to month
  - Activate hashed storage in dev and Ops instances today

### Platform

- GOOD
  - Consistent deliverable hit rate
  - Finally shipped GraphQL endpoint, which had been an OKR at least once before!
  - Hit sourcing goal
  - Having Deliverable and Stretch issues works well; few Stretch issues get hit, but developers indicate that they feel less pressure as the feature freeze nears than before
- BAD
  - Multiple deliverables were affected by urgent work related to the GDPR
  - Multiple deliverables slipped because issue scope wasn't well defined until late into the month, and was often larger than anticipated
  - Only hired 1 person
  - Deliverable hit rate still under 80%
- TRY
  - Being more conservative with maximum weight per person
  - Work with PMs to ensure that issue scope is defined ahead of the kickoff
  - Keep iterating on hiring process

### Gitaly

- GOOD
  - Got on strategy for identifying remaining work to 1.0 (tripswitch)
  - Began working with agency for sourcing hires (Sourcery)
- BAD
  - 1.0 didn't have a fully identified scope until beginning of Q3
  - 1.1 still hasn't become a priority until 1.0 is delivered
  - Lots of churn around who is on the team made consistent throughput difficult
  - Extended use of feature flags made it easy to create complications (easier
    to turn off a feature flag than fix a bug)
  - Hard to attract the right kind of candidate (too many applicants who know
    Rails but only dabble in Golang)
- TRY
  - Working more closely with recruiting agency to get the right kind of hires
  - Keeping team size more stable + above a minimal threshold for forward
    progress
  - Being less conservative with feature flags and a little more willing to
    trade risk for time-to-delivery

### Database

- GOOD
  - Set up of team structure for future team members.
- BAD
  - Self inflicted downtime from maintenance in June
  - Not enough people (2) to pay attention to production stability and work with Engineering teams on performance
  - Small pipeline of candidates for DB roles
- TRY
  - Implement and follow plans for change control around any DB work
  - Initial team structure for Site Availability / Site Reliability including DB
  - Pulled in sourcing agency
  - Updated posts to Ruby Weekly and hackernews

### Production

- GOOD
  - Hiring - help from all involved from recruiting to exec to team was great
  - Started to get a handle on infrastructure work for GCP and burnt down work to do
- BAD
  - Team has been spread thin - only 2 people on call in EU, 4 in Americas regions is hard on productivity
  - GCP dates slipping
- TRY
  - Continued strict focus on getting GCP done with focus on Production stability, GCP, everything else
  - Getting new people in Q3 up to speed and on call in fast, but reasonable time
  - Focus on hiring in EU regions
  - Team structure changes mentioned in database

### Ops Backend

- GOOD
  - Great collaboration with Dev Backend to implement a new hiring process to pool candidates for backend dev roles.
  - Managers across backend teams working and supporting each other through the changes in hiring process.
- BAD
  - Got through the entire hiring process with a great manager candidate and was not able to close them at the offer stage due to a mismatch in compensation expectation.
- TRY
  - Make sure compensation expectation are clear with all candidates during the screening call.
  - Continue to iterate and enhance our pool hiring process.
  - Build a strong pipeline of candidates so that we are choosing the best from multiple good candidates and have a fallback if we loose our first choice

### CI/CD

- GOOD
  - Completed coverage of Auto DevOps with GitLab QA
  - A lot of candidates were sourced
- BAD
  - 75% deliverable completion rate falls quite short of the 100% goal
  - Issues mentioned at kickoff were some of those that didn't get merged
  - Configuration Team splitting off reduced capacity
  - Only new developer hire occurred at very end of quarter
  - Team experienced a lot of transition with new manager and change in PM
- TRY
  - Using weight or throughput to assess delivery impact and team capacity
  - Have new manager focus on hiring for the team especially at the start of the quarter

### Monitoring

- GOOD
  - Great backend work by temporary team member.
  - Delivered features despite being short staffed.
- BAD
  - Short staffed due losing a team member for 1/3 of the quarter.
- TRY
  - Continue to source and hire more onto the team.
  - Size workload better to account for being short staffed.

### Security Products

- GOOD
  - Onboarding is done, the team is working at full speed now.
  - We can ship features with backend in GitLab.
  - Gemnasium migration is done, the team can focus on GitLab issues.
  - We have a release process for Security Products docker images.
- BAD
  - The team should be growing to handle all the domain of Security Products. Even if we sourced 50 people, we didn't manage to hire anyone in this quarter.
  - Some planning issues, due to our lack of knowledge of some processes.
  - The product vision was not aligned with our OKRs, so we had to update them during the quarter to remove some expectations about Gemnasium integration into Omnibus.
  - Not enough time/resources to maintain legacy code and wrappers.
- TRY
  - Improve planning with a Gantt chart.
  - Commit to 100% deliverables shipped to production.
  - Better integration with GitLab QA.
  - Release Manager rotation to handle bugs, tools update, support, etc.

### Security

- GOOD
  - We continue to mitigate new security vulnerabilities at a timeframe that is at or better than industry standard.
  - Our response time to GitLab.com abuse cases has significantly improved through detection automation efforts.
  - Our hiring rate is has been fairly healthy, and sourcing efforts have been successful.
- BAD
  - Logging capabilities are still lacking, such that incident response impact analysis is onerous.
  - Lack of consistent severity and priority labeling on backlogged security issues poses challenge in prioritization.
  - Security roles are difficult to hire for, due to high demand for skilled candidates. Our security compensation benchmark needs to be more competitive to attract top talent.
- TRY
  - Continue to refine and improve upon critical and non-critical security release processes. This will involve continuing to train new RMs to become familiar with the process.
  - Increase security hiring pipelines and close out more hires than past quarters, in order to scale Security Team with company growth and initiatives.

### Support

- GOOD
  - Focus on SLA achievement with training, process and tool enhancements helped global team reach 88% overall.
  - Functionality to track and report on Customer Satisfaction restored.
  - Very good achievement to hiring plan.
- BAD
  - Still too many SLA breaches while we grow the team.
  - Closing Support Engineering manager positions needs to happen faster.
- TRY
  - Source-a-thon for key positions, with less focus on Support Agents and directed regional focus on Support Engineers.
  - Determine ways to streamline technical onboarding.

### Support Engineering

- GOOD
  - More Support Engineers are exposed to High Availability Configurations
  - Ticket Growth for Self-managed customers is growing slower than revenue.
- BAD
  - We need to grow AMER West & APAC to achieve SLA targets
  - Learning GEO is difficult & upgrading GEO needs clearer documentation.
- TRY
  - Targeted APAC recruiting
  - Designing a GEO Bootcamp curriculum
  - Finalize Premium ticket Priority to offer better customer experience.

### Services Support

- GOOD
  - With better staffing we've been able to consistently increase our SLA performance and work through a sizeable backlog.
  - Services Agents have done an great job collaborating on process and documentation.
- BAD
  - This quarters hires are starting later in the quarter than we would have liked.
  - We haven't been able to close any EMEA hires.
- TRY
  - Get a first iteration on our [Statement of Support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/issues/1161) finalized.
  - Focus on EMEA hiring in source-a-thons and recruiting.
  - Transition GitLab.com free users out of ZenDesk.

### Quality

- GOOD
  - Unblocking ourselves after Looker ETL delays for building quality metrics dashboard. We completed the prototype and it is running at: http://quality-dashboard.gitlap.com
  - Everyone in the team has clear ownership and priorities.
  - We made good progress with hiring and sourcing.
- BAD
  - We discovered a lot of un-triaged CE & EE bugs as part of the dashboard prototype implementation.
  - ETL for GitLab.com Looker was delayed. We were blocked for multiple weeks.
  - Lack of test coverage in gitlab-qa and in the release process.
  - The team is stretched thin, especially with issue and merge request triage. Quality team rotation hasn't been enough help, a lot of this still falls on Mark F.
- TRY
  - We need to plan very early to get help from other teams on cross-functional initiatives (esp with CE/EE code reorg). Issues should be prepped and communicate at least one milestone ahead and communicate again before the start of the milestone.
  - Implement issue triage assignments for the rest of engineering and not just for the quality team.
  - For important deliverables and initiatives, we should lean on tools that are more in our sphere of control.
  - Bring up more gitlab-qa test automation coverage.

### UX

- GOOD
  - Research and design work done for Auto DevOps in Q1 set us up for success in delivering UX Ready solutions.
  - Increased engagement and collaboration between PM and UXers.
  - Sourcing and hiring went smoothly with many good candidates.
- BAD
  - Hiring and increasing workloads slowed down progress on the design system.
  - Scheduling became time-consuming as we iterated on the process and PM/UXer/FE handoff.
- TRY
  - Continue to iterate on scheduling and planning process.
  - Focus work in design system on areas that support GitLab vision and increase usability.

### Pipe-to-Spend

- GOOD
  - 148% of opportunity value creation target achieved.
  - 185% of SMB / Self Serve IACV plan achieved.
  - Improved visibility of inbound demand with the introduction of Bizible, and campaign performance with the new campaign dashboard.
  - Content team hit 100% of their KRs and content (especially video content) has improved.
- BAD
  - 82% of revised Q2 Field Marketing SCLAU forecast.
  - Hiring plan not met by 1 person each in field marketing and online growth.
  - Over committing and under delivering on field events. Communication, collaboration, and organization are not consistently good.
  - Hard to work with other teams that do not work asynchronously. Too many meetings being held with no outcome.
- TRY
  - Standardize and document process for evaluating whether or not we should sponsor an event with clear expectations in terms of SCLAU and ROI.
  - Respectfully push back when last minute requests are made that wonâ€™t move the needle.
  - Share customer feedback and pain points with product management on the CustomersDot to ensure it supports a more self-serve experience involving upgrades, true-ups and renewals.
  - Put more time into cross functional coordination and kickoffs to ensure PMM, GM, Sales et al are working tightly together. Hold each other accountable to GitLabâ€™s async workflow and MVCs.
