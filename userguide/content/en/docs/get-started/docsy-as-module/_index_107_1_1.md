## Phase Overview

Iteration 0 consists of four key activities that build upon each other:

1. [EM>PS Transition](#emps-transition) - Internal knowledge transfer
2. [Stakeholder Planning Meeting](#stakeholder-planning-meeting) - Initial customer alignment
3. [Customer Kickoff](#customer-kickoff) - Full team engagement
4. [Support Preparation](#prepare-support-for-issues) - Proactive issue management

Each activity has specific inputs, processes, and outputs to ensure a smooth start to your project.

## Prepare Support for Issues

**Purpose:** Proactively prepare the Support team by providing key project information to streamline issue resolution during the engagement.

> This process is critical for infrastructure-related projects like implementations but valuable for any engagement where support issues may arise.

### ZenDesk Access

If you don't have ZenDesk light (Read-Only) access:

- For Zendesk Global
  - See [Requesting a ZenDesk â€˜Light Agentâ€™ account](../../../../support/internal-support/#requesting-a-zendesk-light-agent-account)

  1. Open an [Access Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Individual_Bulk_Access_Request)
  1. Make sure the `System name` value is `Zendesk - US Federal, light agent access`
  1. Assign to your manager

     - Keep in mind you must have US citizenship to have this access

### Creating a Support Note

{{% alert title="Note" color="danger" %}}
