## What are trade control laws?

Trade control laws, which often consist of sanctions, export controls, and import laws, govern how and under what circumstances technology, software, and technical assistance may be exported. Trade control laws vary from country to country but usually exist to protect national security and further foreign policy and economic interests.

Under United States law, exports, re-exports, and transfers, can take many forms, including oral, written, and visual disclosure, physical shipment, and electronic transfer or transmission. An export can also occur when technology, software, or technical assistance is transmitted to U.S. nationals abroad, or to non-U.S. nationals located within the United States. The export of certain software, technology, or technical assistance to certain countries, certain end users, or for certain end uses, may require authorization from the United States government prior to export, re-export, or transfer.

The GitLab Community Edition is freely available to the public and is not subject to the EAR.
