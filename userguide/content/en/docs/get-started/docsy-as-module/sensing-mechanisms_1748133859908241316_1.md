title: Sensing Mechanisms

## What are sensing mechanisms?

Our ability to iterate quickly is a measure of our efficiency, but our effectiveness
is just as critical. As a product manager you are critical to us not just working correctly,
but working on the correct things. You do that by [prioritizing appropriately](/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization/). Your
prioritization decisions will be enhanced if you maintain a sufficient understanding of the
context in which you make them.

There is no limit to the amount of inputs you can utilize for making prioritization decisions.
We've organized these mechanisms into three lists. One for those that primarily sense feedback from users,
one that primarily senses feedback from buyers and another that senses internally
generated feedback which could represent buyers or users. For new PMs consider
these lists as guidance for places to ensure you are plugged in to maintain
sufficient context.

In 2020, we [conducted a GTM and R&D sensing mechanism survey](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/1540) to get an understanding of how team members valued the sensing mechanisms listed below. We calculated this value by multiplying their responses (1-5) for how efficient they felt a sensing mechanism was by how their responses (1-4) for how effective they felt the sensing mechanism was. We've ranked the below lists by the average value from all respondents.

## Sensing Mechanisms by Type

### User

1. Asking probing questions in customer discovery meetings
1. Engaging with our community alongside our [Developer Relations team](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/) and [triaging](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/contributing/issue_workflow/#issue-triaging) community generated issues and ideas

### Market

1. Maintaining [competitive](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/competitive-intelligence/) and [market assessments](/handbook/product/product-processes/#analyst-engagement/). Checkout this [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um9teDD6jt8&feature=youtu.be&t=300) discussing competitive analysis for Product Managers at Product League with GitLab's Orit Golowinski.
1. Monitoring and maintaining missing [features](https://about.gitlab.com/features/) in your category epics (competitive landscape section)

### Internal

1. Leadership [OKRs](/handbook/company/okrs/) set the direction for the company

Share this discussion with the company via our GitLab Unfiltered [YouTube](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/youtube/) channel. PMs should share their next three milestones, year-long plan, strategy, and relevant OKRs (with status) so everyone can contribute feedback.
