title: Google Docs and Drive Internal Sharing Guide
---

## Overview

As part of our transparency value, most Google Docs should be transparent to all team members. It takes a conscious effort by everyone to be sure to share their Google Docs for the company to see.

> **Efficiency Tip:** You should use your team's Shared Drive instead of `My Drive` and create documents in a folder that is already shared with the company. This simplifies your workflow so you don't need to remember to share each document.
