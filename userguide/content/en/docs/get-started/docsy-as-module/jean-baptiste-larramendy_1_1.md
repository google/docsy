## Jean-Baptiste Larramendy's README

### About me

Hi! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My name is Jean-Baptiste, or JB. Let‚Äôs go with JB as it‚Äôs much easier for everyone.¬† I'm currently GitLab‚Äôs Global Sales Development Team leader.

I have spent my entire career in sales and have specialized in Sales Development over the past 10 years. Even though I love building organizations that scale and consistently deliver results, my ultimate goal is to make as many people successful as I can.

This page is intended to give you a quick overview of who I am before we get the chance to meet.

Here's a bit about me:

- I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
- I am a dual citizen: French & Canadian
- I have 2 mostly wonderful kids and a fantastic wife
- I have lived, studied and worked in France, Spain, Germany and now Canada
- I love all things outdoors
- My 2 favorite quotes are: ‚ÄúTake your job seriously, never take yourself seriously‚Äù & ‚ÄúA smooth sea never made a skilled sailor‚Äù

- Maximizer: You focus on strengths as a way to stimulate personal and group excellence. You seek to transform something strong into something superb.

### Communicating with me

I'm pretty informal, message me on Slack, send an email, or tag me on a thread, and I'll respond as soon as I can. It‚Äôs very important for me to know people: who they are, and what makes them tick. I love Coffee chats and connecting with people. So please reach out.

### What I Assume about Others
