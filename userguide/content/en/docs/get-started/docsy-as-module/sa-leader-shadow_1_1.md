## Program Preparation

### Confidentiality

As a shadow, you'll have access to confidential information requiring compliance with the [Designated Insiders process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mcBtnfGbv4jSsJUklMQYyj2052MBHe4Lf9RkE-B9yvA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.b3pm8ljoip1y) for the entire quarter. Even after the quarter is complete, the program's success depends on continually maintaining this trust beyond the duration of the shadow.

### Getting Ready for Your Shadowing Experience

Ensure you've made necessary preparations before beginning.

Take time to review your calendar and confirm you can fully commit to this development opportunity. Verify that your current workload allows for dedicated shadowing time, and arrange coverage for any essential deals under your responsibility. Before starting, have a detailed conversation with your assigned manager to get clarity on the shadowing schedule and expectations.

To provide you with diverse leadership exposure, you'll be matched with a leader outside your direct reporting line. This intentional pairing allows you to observe and learn from different management approaches and leadership styles.

The SA leader you will shadow will maximise your exposure to a diverse set of activities, however some of them may not be available during your shadowing and this is up to the shadowing SA leader discretion.
