# 1. Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this Information Classification Policy is to ensure that all information assets handled by Green Orbit Digital are appropriately identified, classified, and protected according to their sensitivity, legal requirements, and business value. 

This policy establishes a consistent framework for managing information across its lifecycle—from creation and storage to sharing and disposal.
This policy applies to:

- All employees, contractors, interns, and third-party providers who create, access, process, or manage Green Orbit Digital’s information.

- All information types (digital, physical, spoken), regardless of format or medium.

- All platforms, including Notion, Proton Drive, HubSpot, and collaborative tools.

# 2. Information Classification Levels

Green Orbit Digital classifies information into four tiers based on sensitivity, confidentiality, and potential impact if disclosed:

## 2.1 Public Information

Approved for external release; no adverse impact if disclosed.

Examples: Marketing brochures, published research, social media content, press releases.

Handling: May be freely distributed; does not require special safeguards.

## 2.2 Internal Information

Intended solely for internal use; moderate business impact if disclosed.

Examples: Project briefs, non-sensitive internal emails, meeting notes, training materials.

Handling: Shared within teams; access limited to Green Orbit Digital staff.


## 2.3 Confidential Information

Sensitive business or personal data requiring protection; moderate to high impact if exposed.

Examples: Client data, NDAs, contracts, financial records, performance reviews.

Handling: Access restricted to authorised personnel on a need-to-know basis.

Must be encrypted at rest and in transit.

## 2.4 Restricted Information

Critical and high-risk data whose unauthorised access would cause severe damage to the business or stakeholders.

Examples: Authentication credentials, encryption keys, vulnerability reports, incident logs.

Handling: Highly restricted; access limited to explicitly authorised individuals. Multi-factor authentication required. Must never be sent via unsecured channels.

# 3. Handling Requirements

## 3.1 Storage

- Public/Internal: Stored in shared drives or Notion with standard access controls.

- Confidential/Restricted: Encrypted using AES-256 or higher.

- Backed up regularly with retention based on classification.

- Hosted on platforms with relevant compliance certifications (e.g. Proton Drive, ISO 27001-compliant services).

## 3.2 Transmission

- Internal/Public: May use standard email or shared folders.

- Confidential: Must be sent using encrypted email or secure file transfer protocols.

- Restricted: Shared only over end-to-end encrypted channels.

- Prohibited from being emailed unless using secure encryption tools (e.g. Proton Mail with password protection).

## 3.3 Access Control

Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented across all systems.
Access must follow the principle of least privilege.
All restricted assets require multi-factor authentication.
Quarterly access audits are conducted to validate access rights.
