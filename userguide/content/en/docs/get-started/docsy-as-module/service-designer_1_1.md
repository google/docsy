## Hiring Process

Candidates for this position can expect the hiring process to follow the order below, although it may change depending on calendar availability. Please keep in mind that candidates can be declined from the position at any stage of the process.

### Step 1: Recruiter Screening Call

Qualified candidates will be invited to schedule a 30 minute [screening call](/handbook/hiring) with one of our Global Recruiters.  In this call, we will discuss your experience, understand what you are looking for in a service design role, talk about your work and approach to service design, discuss your compensation expectations, and reasons why you want to join GitLab, and answer any questions you have.

### Step 2: Portfolio Review and interview

After a successful screening call, we'll ask for your portfolio to review. If your portfolio demonstrates the skills we're looking for, you'll have a 90-minute interview with the hiring manager and a UX researcher from the team. 

During the interview, you’ll be asked several situational questions to help us learn how you have responded or would respond in certain scenarios. You should be prepared to discuss your service design process, details about how you collaborate with cross-functional teams, and how you approach your role.

You’ll also have an opportunity to present a case study from your portfolio. We’ll look for you to walk through a project so we can understand your process, approach, and philosophy to service design, the size and structure of the team you were a part of, the goals of the project, your research methods, service blueprinting, journey mapping, and how you synthesized research data to inform design decisions. We want to hear about the challenges you faced, the impact of your work, and how you collaborated with a wider team, including product, engineering, and operations. Be prepared to discuss your project in-depth for about 30 minutes.

Towards the end of the interview, you’ll be given some time to ask questions.

### Step 3: Team Interviews

If you successfully pass the previous interviews, you’ll first meet with a Product Design Manager for a 1 hour interview. This interview will focus on assessing your research, strategy, and service design skills. The interviewer will want to understand how you have incorporated research and data into your work and get a feel for your understanding of service design fundamentals, methodologies, and system-wide thinking. Be prepared to answer questions around the soft skills needed for service designers and how you apply them in real-world scenarios.

The next and final interview will be with a product manager and an engineering manager. They’ll focus on your ability to collaborate with product, engineering, and operational teams and determine how well your skills align with the needs of a specific service design initiative.

Successful candidates will subsequently be made an offer through a video call or phone call.
