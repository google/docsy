# Growth and Development Fund

[Unsupported block type: image]
A description of programs and resources for team members to access when using the G&D Fund.
The Growth and Development (G&D) Fund can be used by GitLab team members to receive reimbursement for approved growth experiences and opportunities at GitLab. Team members can be reimbursed for up to $10,000 per calendar year for approved growth experiences, provided they meet all eligibility requirements.
Whether you want to upskill with new certifications, attend industry conferences, or explore courses to enhance your expertise, this fund is an amazing resource to help you shape your career at GitLab and support [High Performing Teams](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/high-performing-teams/).
The Growth and Development (G&D) fund is managed by the [Talent Development team](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/#learning--development-team). For any questions, please contact a team member directly, or reach out in the #learninganddevelopment slack channel.
If you’ve never used the Growth & Development Fund before, check out the short instructional course in [Level Up](https://university.gitlab.com/access/saml/login/internal-team-members?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Funiversity.gitlab.com%2Flearn%2Fcourse%2Fgrowth-and-development-explainer) to get a bitesize overview.
## Eligibility
To use the Growth and Development fund, applicants must be full-time GitLab employees who meet performance expectations in their role and are not on ‘leave’ status.
## Process
Here is a step by step guide on how to apply for G&D applications.
If it’s your first tie using the Fund, we’ve created a comprehensive guide on Level Up that walks you through the G&D process, complete with video tutorials and step-by-step examples. Check out the [Growth & Development Explainer](https://university.gitlab.com/access/saml/login/internal-team-members?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Funiversity.gitlab.com%2Flearn%2Fcourse%2Fgrowth-and-development-explainer) course.
### Step 1 - Growth Conversation
Start by having a [growth conversation](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#what-is-career-development) with your manager to discuss the learning opportunity. It’s important to talk through the timing, workload, and application timeline of the program to ensure coverage for your team. This conversation should allow time for you to apply for the program before it begins and allow your manager to ensure team capacity.
[G&D Select](https://university.gitlab.com/access/saml/login/internal-team-members?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Funiversity.gitlab.com%2Fpages%2Fgd-select) is a directory of opportunities of recommended opportunities from GitLab team members.

### Step 4 - Make Purchase & Complete your Opportunity
Once all necessary approvals have been given in your G&D application issue, you are OK to proceed with paying for your opportunity and any necessary travel arrangements.
All individual G&D requests should be paid for by the team member who has applied for the opportunity.
Once you have paid for the opportunity, you can proceed with taking part in, and completing it, in whatever form that might take.
### Step 5 - Reimbursement
In most cases, the costs of Growth and Development requests are paid back to team members after the opportunity has been completed. Team members should therefore be prepared to accept financial responsibility for the cost of the opportunity they have chosen. You can find further information about how reimbursement works for different types of G&D opportunities below.
However, all requests are eligible to have [50% of the costs repaid upfront](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/growth-and-development/#50-upfront-reimbursement), and 50% upon completion.
All expenses should be claimed via [Navan](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#-introduction) using the following process:
1. Open a new expense claim in Navan using the Expense type `G&D (Growth and Development)`.
1. Include a screenshot of your approved G&D issue, and add the link to your issue in the description.
1. Add a screenshot showing proof of completion for your application. (Read more about the eligibilty for reimbursement for your application type [below](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/growth-and-development/#types-of-growth-and-development-reimbursements)).
### Travel Expenses
As is detailed in the issue template, details of travel-related expenses, including costs for travel, lodging, and meals, should still be included in your G&D issue for approval.
However, they must be expensed separately to your G&D claim, following GitLab’s [Travel and Expense policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#41-travel-related-expenses). Add a link to your G&D issue in the claim description. Please select `Growth and Development` as the Classification for these expenses, but not as the ‘Expense Type’.
### 50% Upfront Reimbursement
As an option, all requests can take advantage of a split disbursement option designed to help team members carry the financial lift of costly experiences. This split disbursement option allows for 50% of the costs to be reimbursed immediately after payment and the remaining 50% is reimbursed upon completion.
Here’s how this workflow works:
1. After all necessary approvals, the requesting team member pays for the approved G&D experience.
1. The team member can submit the proof of payment in a Navan expense request, and the approved GitLab issue, to receive a reimbursement of 50% of the total costs. When submitting in Navan, please state explicitly in the `Description` section of your expense claim that this is for a 50% reimbursement, with a link to your approved G&D issue.
1. Upon completion, the team member will submit the proof of completion (certificate, completion email, etc.) along with that same approved issue to receive the remaining 50% of total costs.
Please note that upfront reimbursement does not extend to travel, hotel, or meals expenses as these are expensed from a separate budget, it can only be used for the cost of the Growth and Development opportunity, more details in the [Workshops and Conferences](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/growth-and-development/#workshops-and-conferences) section.
### Step 6 - Close & Feedback
Once you have successfully claimed for reimbursement, please go back and close your issue. If you found the G&D experience to be of significant benefit, and you would recommend it to other team members, please leave a comment in the G&D feedback issue, so that the Talent Development team can add the opportunity to our G&D Select page.

## Bulk Applications
If you’re submitting a bulk application, where multiple team members are applying for the same opportunity, at the same time, please consider the following:
- If multiple team members are doing the same training or attending the same conference, please open one issue.
- Each team member should pay for their own expenses and process their own reimbursement through Navan. Team Members or Managers should not cover the expenses of other team members, as any reimbursements will count against their Growth and Development allowance.
- All bulk applications should still follow the reimbursement workflow via Navan where expenses can be claimed after completing the course or attending the conference. They should not be paid for by any other methods.
### Company-directed Learning Opportunities
The Growth and Development policy is meant to further team members’ learning and growth. Company-directed learning opportunities, such as mandatory conferences or training required to fulfill job duties, aren’t within the scope for G&D and should be budgeted for outside the policy.
### I’m a manager who would like to use the G&D Fund for a training for my whole team, is that allowed?
The G&D Fund is primarily designed for individual use, and each team member is entitled to use the Fund for their own career development. However, if each individual in a team has G&D allowance remaining, there may be instances where a team-based or manager led opportunity is suitable. Please reach out in the #learninganddevelopment channel to discuss the suitability of the opportunity you are recommending. The team will review these on a case by case basis.
## Policy Notes / FAQs
### Overspending
If you are found to have reimbursed over $10,000 within a calendar year, you will be required to pay back anything over $10,000 that has been spent.
### Recoupment of Growth and Development Reimbursements
If you voluntarily terminate employment with GitLab prior to completing twelve consecutive months of active employment, academic study or tuition expenses of $1,000 USD and over will need to be refunded to GitLab.
### How can I track my G&D spend?
If you wish to know how much of your G&D Fund you have remaining for the calendar year, please reach out in the #learninganddevelopment slack channel.
We are working on improving this process and hope to provide a self-service option soon.
### Does budget rollover?
Unspent G&D budgets do not ‘rollover’ from one year to the next, the maximum any team member can expense per year is $10,000.
### Can spare budget be shared with team members?
Budgets are individual and cannot be shared across teams. E.g. If one team member has $5000 remaining, this can’t be attributed to another team member to pay on their behalf.
### Can I pay for one opportunity over multiple years?
If your G&D opportunity is across more than 1 year, you can distribute the costs by reimbursing across multiple years. However, you still cannot exceed $10,000 expensed per year,
## Tax Implications
In some countries, the Growth and Development Fund may be considered as taxable income and can be (partially) exempted from personal income taxes or subject to employer withholding taxes. Check [the tax table](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/growth-and-development/tax/) for any tax implications in your country.
For example, in the United States 2021 tax year, if GitLab pays over [$5,250 for educational benefits for you during the year, you must generally pay tax on the amount over $5,250](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-benefits-for-education-information-center). GitLab should include in your wages (Form W-2, box 1) the amount over $5,250 in income.
Please contact [Payroll](mailto:payroll@gitlab.com) for any tax-related questions in your country.
