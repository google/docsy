## Communications within Product and Solution  Marketing

As a distributed organization, GitLab and [our Product and Solution Marketing department and teams](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/) use [asynchronous](/handbook/people-group/employment-branding/people-communications/), [transparent](/handbook/values/#transparency), [frequent](/handbook/values/#iteration), and [multimodal communication](/handbook/communication/#multimodal-communication) to keep ourselves informed.

Our most important communication channels are issues, boards, and GitLab itself, followed by [this handbook](/handbook/), Slack, Zoom, and other tools. See [the general GitLab Communication page](/handbook/communication/) and [Tools and Tips](/handbook/tools-and-tips/) for more information.

Below are the parts of GitLab and Slack that are used most in Product and Solution Marketing.

### GitLab trackers, boards, handbook, etc

Copy in from [/product-marketing](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/).

### Slack channels

GitLab has more Slack channels than usersâ€”at last count, [1,492 public channels for 1,069 weekly active users](https://gitlab.slack.com/stats).

These lists will make it a little easier to get started. They are arranged as general to GitLab, specific to Product and Solution Marketing, then a few more recommendations and some just for fun, before sharing a few Slack pro-tips.

*Reminder: Slack data are only retained for 90 days. If you share, discover, or decide something important there, ensure it has a permanent place in our handbook, product docs, etc. and read [the general handbook section for Slack guidelines](/handbook/communication/#slack).*

- local channels: for your area or one you're visiting, hit command-K or 'Jump to...' in the upper left of the UI and search for 'loc_'.

### Slack hacks

Don't miss the critical **[handbook section with Slack guidelines](/handbook/communication/#slack)**. We also recommend:

- **use stars:** on the upper left of the UI, star the channels and direct message threads you use most
- **monitor keywords:** go to Slack > preferences and go to 'Notifications'. Scroll down to 'My keywords' and add as many as you like, comma-separated. Keywords some of use include 'PMM' and 'product marketing'.
- **tailor notifications:** go to Slack > preferences and go to 'Notifications'. Tweak to your heart's content. To set channel-specific notifications, go to the channel and click the channel name in the conversation header. Next, click the notifications drop-down menu and choose your notification preference.
- [#slack-power-users](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/CNDBDLXFD): of course! a channel for our friendly neighborhood power users. Join at your own risk.
