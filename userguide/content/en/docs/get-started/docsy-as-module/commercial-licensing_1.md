## Situation

Situation:  Ownership for business outcomes and the customer experience surrounding billing/licensing workflows is very distributed across Fulfillment, Growth, BizOps, SalesOps, Marketing Ops, Sales.  Given there is no single business owner for this, we wanted to bring together a cross-functional working group to help provide a unified direction for the responsible teams.

## Purpose

Define business & customer experience requirements for a system to handle commercial and licensing transactions into the future.

## Exit Criteria

- TBD
