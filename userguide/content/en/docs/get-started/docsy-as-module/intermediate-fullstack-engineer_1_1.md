## Specialties

### Growth

The [Growth sub-department](/handbook/marketing/growth/engineering/) analyzes the entire customer journey from the acquisition of a customer, to the flow across multiple GitLab features, and even reactivation of lost users. They work in small groups with a product manager, product designer, and a data analyst to scale GitLab usage by connecting users to the existing value that GitLab already delivers.

#### Growth Requirements

- Due to the nature of our tech stack, the volume and complexity of work is weighted more strongly towards backend, rather than frontend.

### Govern

The [Govern sub-department](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/govern/) contributes to development in the [Sec](/handbook/product/categories/#sec-section) section.

#### Govern Requirements

- Passion for security.
- Understanding of all levels of OSI network model and common network protocols.
- Understanding of infrastructure & application deployment models (Kubernetes, Docker, AWS/GCP/Azure).
- Understanding of detecting and preventing attacks at the network, container, operating system, and application level.

## Performance Indicators

- [Backend Unit Test Coverage](/handbook/engineering/development/performance-indicators/#backend-unit-test-coverage)
