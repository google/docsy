## 1. POLICY

GitLab’s Global Travel & Expense Policy is meant to provide guidance to all Team Members to ensure that we act in the best interest of our Company at all times. The purpose of this policy is to:

## 2. Responsibilities

**Team Members**:

- As a public company, GitLab has an obligation to act in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders. This obligation is shared by all Team Members and is the basis of our global travel and expense policy as a public company; Team Members must be thoughtful in spending the company's money.

- Review and process all expense reports that require AP Admin review, within 7 working days from the date submitted.

**Finance**:

- Maintain departmental budgets for Travel and Entertainment and Offsites.
- Work with respective Business Partners to provide specific team budgets and amounts spent to date.

## 3. General Guidelines

- Team members should submit receipts for every business expense. For Non-US Team Members, receipts are required for all expenses. US Team Members are required to only submit receipts for any expenses over $50 USD.  Receipts must contain vendor name, date of purchase, listing of what was purchased, and contains a full breakout of the subtotal and tax amounts. Snapshot from phone/computer screen of Applications, Card/Bank Statements are not an acceptable form of receipt.
- Team Members are not allowed to expense items on behalf of their managers.
Payments, gifts, favors, or entertainment for officials, employees, or representatives of government-owned entities are strictly prohibited, regardless of value.
- Expense claims for a single item up to $5,000 can be expensed via Navan. >$5,000 needs to go through the procurement process in Zip.
- Expense claims over 90 days from purchase date will not be reimbursed unless approved by the Manager.
- Navan Description box: Expense items must have a description filled out. This box is showing as optional but we require this to be filled in. This helps to correctly record the transaction and assist any reporting purposes downstream.
  - When filling in the description box , we ask for you to enter details of the expense so anyone looking at the line on a report can tell immediately (without the need of looking at the receipt) what the expense relates to and why it is claimed.
  - Please fill in the description box with details like : Items Purchased/Claimed, Period service relates to, Trip Details this claim relates to, Reason for trip, Clients Name, etc. If left blank, the expense will be bounced back to the team member to complete this portion.
- The maximum monthly limit to be reimbursed is $10K USD (or local currency equivalent). Once this limit has been reached, all expense items will need to be approved by the A/P team in Navan.  This limit may be increased for Team Members whose positions require more spend (eg. Field Marketing), but the increase request needs to be submitted via an issue for approval by the VP, Corporate Controller and CAO. Due to the nature of their roles, E-Group members have a maximum monthly limit to be reimbursed of $20K USD before additional approvals are required.
- Expenditures related to client entertainment or marketing must be necessary, prudent, and job-related.
- Expenses that span longer than a month must be submitted on a monthly basis (eg. Although you paid for a year upfront for the internet, you must divide the total by 12 months and submit the cost monthly), with the exception of VPN.
- Gift cards are not accepted as a form of payment for business expenses.
- Expense items must clearly state if the spend includes amounts for clients / non-Team Members. Tax requirements in certain countries require us to account for client spending differently.
- Anything submitted outside of these guidelines will be flagged as Out of Policy.
- All work-related expenses (internet, co-working space, other monthly subscription, etc.) are not reimbursable while on Leave of any kind.
- For PEO's, as you are aware with Navan, the system will automatically reimburse in the currency of the GitLab organization you are employed. To ensure you are reimbursed in the currency in which your PEO needs to be invoiced please submit your expenses in the payment currency you will be invoicing the PEO in. i.e. if you invoice your PEO in USD, then convert the expense into USD prior to submitting the expense report in Navan. This will then allow you to know the exact amount to invoice the PEO every month. If this is not doable then we will convert the currency using the FX rates from Netsuite on the day this expense is transferred to payroll for payment to the PEO.
- As with any third-party, it is best practice to limit the amount of personal data shared. The inclusion of personal data on your receipts is not required to submit an expense, so feel free to redact personal data for increased privacy. However, this is not a required step. For those that choose not to redact personal data from your expense receipts, the privacy and security controls in place at Navan were evaluated and they are designed to adequately protect your information.

### 3.1 Out of Policy Transactions

- Note that when expenses are flagged as “Out of Policy” in Navan, this does not necessarily mean the expense is “Out of Policy”. It can also mean that additional review is needed due to a requirement for  certain attachments (eg. an approved issue) and/or additional approvals.
- Upon review, if more clarification is needed for a certain expense, the AP team will contact the Team Member in the Navan tool to ask for justification of the transaction before approving or rejecting the expense.
- The AP team will reach out to the Team Member’s manager if additional approval is needed.
- If the claim is over the advised guidance, the claim will be rejected with a note for the Team Member. The Team Member should be able to rectify the claim and resubmit.
- Where the Team Member has already received approval from the manager, that approval should be attached as a receipt on the claim transaction.
- Any claim made which does not fall into the policy is not reimbursable.  If an item is out of policy and approved by your manager, then please obtain and attach your manager's approval email prior to submitting the expense. This will then be reviewed by the Expense team Admin and could need further approval from VP, Corporate Controller or CAO.
- There will be occasions where if you have claimed an item and it needs to be reimbursed back to GitLab, you will need to follow the repayment process in Navan for submission of the funds.

### 3.2 Other

- Out of Policy Transactions for all E-Group Members (excluding the CFO) needs to be approved by the CFO.
- Any exceptions to the policy must be documented via an issue or an email with proper approvals from their manager and Finance team.

## 4. PROCEDURES

The airfare policy in Navan is set up as a “Dynamic Policy” which calculates a fair market price for every search based on travel dates and destinations. Any purchases that are over 20% of the Dynamic Policy will be flagged for further review by your manager. Also note that anything booked outside of Navan will flag as “Out of Policy”, and will need to be reviewed by your manager and the AP team.

#### Additional Car Rental Guidelines

**A. Third Party Liability**

Purchase the liability insurance that is excess of the standard inclusion of State minimum coverage in the rental agreement at the rental agency. GitLab’s insurance policy provides liability insurance for rental cars while conducting company business, but it may be excess over any underlying liability coverage through the driver or credit card company used to purchase the rental.

Purchase the liability offered at the rental counter if there are Non-US Team Members renting autos in the US or Canada. While workers' compensation would protect an injured US Team Member, other passengers may have the right to sue. To ensure that GitLab has protection when a Non-US Team Member invites another person into the car we recommend the purchase of this insurance when offered at the rental counter.

**B. Physical Damage - Collision Damage Waiver**

Do Not purchase the Collision Damage Waiver offered at the rental counter. GitLab purchases coverage for damage to rented vehicles. If travel to Mexico is required, purchase the liability insurance for Mexico offered at the rental counter. You should verify that the rental agreement clearly states that the vehicle may be driven into Mexico and liability coverage will apply.

Countries other than the US and Canada:

- Third Party Liability
  - Purchase the liability insurance offered at the rental counter when traveling outside the US and Canada. Automobile Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability insurance are required by law in almost every country. Please verify this coverage is included with the rental agreement.
- Physical Damage - Collision Damage Waiver
  - Purchase the Collision Damage Waiver or Physical Damage Coverage offered by the rental agency when traveling outside the US and Canada.

In the event of an accident resulting in damage to the rental car, the Non-US rental agency will charge the credit card used to make the reservation with an estimated amount of repair costs if insurance is not purchased. If this happens, GitLab does not purchase Foreign Corporate Hired Auto Physical Damage Coverage to reimburse for damages.

- Prefer virtual meetings and attendance over personal meetings, except when the event's objective is enhanced by meeting in real life.
- For short-distance travel, consider ground travel over air travel for information on short distance travel recommendations visit these examples from the University of Bern, University of Lund.
- Select trips with lower carbon emissions. When booking travel through Navan Tripactions you can view the total CO2 footprint for at the checkout screen.
- If you organize an in-person meeting, aim for a location that allows as many people as possible to travel in a sustainable way.
- Carbon offsets offered by airlines have dubious value, so aim to avoid air travel where it makes sense.
