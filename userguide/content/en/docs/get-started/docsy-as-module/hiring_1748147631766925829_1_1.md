- **Hiring is a priority.** GitLab is a fast-growing company, and paying
  attention to hiring is one of the highest-leverage activities a manager can
  perform. As long as there are vacancies on your team, hiring should be your top
  priority.
- **Hiring is your responsibility.** You may rely on other members of your team
  to help you evaluate potential candidates. We also have many people at GitLab,
  most notably in Talent Acquisition, who will help you through the process. But it is
  always your responsibility to make timely, high-quality hires - speak up if
  you feel like anything is preventing you from accomplishing this goal.
- **Hiring is about making the team better.** It is easy to try to find
  candidates who can merely perform the functions of the role, and more
  difficult to find people who make the team better while they do it.
- **Hiring is hard.** It often involves making difficult decisions, and learning
  to do it well can take years. In times of rapid growth, it may consume 50% or
  more of your time. Please use every resource available to you, from
  more experienced hiring managers in the company to the many resources
  [available in our handbook](/handbook/hiring/interviewing/).
