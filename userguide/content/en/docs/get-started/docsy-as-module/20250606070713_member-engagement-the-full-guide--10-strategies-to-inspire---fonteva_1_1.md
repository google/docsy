## What is member engagement?

<!-- Unsupported block type: image -->

This is the definition of member engagement (explore in the text below).

Association member engagement is the ongoing outreach and interactions between associations and their members to keep constituents informed, educated, and motivated to continue their memberships.

By extension, a member engagement strategy consists of the messaging, content, and opportunities that associations share with their members to encourage interaction. While some members will leap to engage with your offerings as soon as they sign up, others will need more guidance. Poor member engagement rates could be a sign your offerings as a whole need an upgrade.

### Defining and measuring member engagement

The way that a university association measures member engagement differs from how a professional association measures engagement. The former will typically look at event attendance, while the latter might refer to their learning management system (LMS) to gauge how often members take advantage of further education opportunities.

Since no two associations are the same, the way your association measures member engagement will also be unique. Set your own benchmarks for member engagement by considering your long-term goals, such as improving retention or building an online community.

Review the offerings your association already offers and how members interface with them. For instance, observe how your members engage with experiences, such as:

- Online community platforms

- Email marketing

- Live events

- Learning opportunities

Once you understand what member engagement means to your association, you can quantify these interactions. This can be done by setting, tracking, and analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Setting KPIs for member engagement

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are strategic metrics your association can set to measure your progress toward specific, quantifiable goals. KPIs help you and your staff measure your association’s performance based on key objectives. After defining what member engagement means to your association, set KPIs to evaluate your success at reaching specific engagement targets.

Here are some examples of KPIs based on where your members may be currently active:

- Social media platforms. Measure your association’s number of followers, comments, likes, and profile tags or references on each social media platform you are active on. Pay attention to which of your posts get the most attention.

- Email marketing. Track your email open and click-through rates, the number of members who opted to receive your newsletter, and the frequency of members’ responses.

- Live events. For each event, record how many people registered, total attendance, how people found out about your event, and the type of tickets people bought.

- Learning opportunities. Track metrics from your association’s LMS system, such as which classes are most popular, how many members received accreditations, and how often members start courses but do not finish.

Specialized tools make tracking engagement-related KPIs easy. For instance, associations that host their communities on a community engagement platform can generate reports to track the total number of comments, member posts, likes, and so on. These tools can also provide granular data to show how active each individual member is.

## Why is member engagement important?

### Increased member retention

From a management point of view, member engagement is crucial to promoting member retention. The more you engage your members, the more likely they are to renew their memberships.

Focusing on member retention is generally more cost-effective than member acquisition, meaning building a loyal member base will better support your organization’s stability in the long run. Consider what offerings your association can provide to boost the value of your memberships. No one will pay to be a part of your organization without gaining something meaningful in return.

### Member engagement and community-building

Member engagement doesn’t just help you develop better relationships with your members. It also involves encouraging members to interact and engage with each other.

For professional and trade associations, 67% of members cite networking as their top reason for joining. Connecting with others in their fields helps these individuals improve their skills, meet like-minded people, and advance their careers.

Ensure your members are able to build new connections by fostering a strong community. To accomplish this, you might:

- Host live events. Events give your members a chance to come together and socialize. In-person events, in particular, provide a space for members to interact face-to-face. For example, a conference allows members to come together and talk about new innovations and improvements in their field.

- Provide an online member portal. While your association may have recurring in-person meetings and annual events, a growing membership requires an intuitive online member portal. An online portal provides access to all of an individual’s member information and your association’s offerings, including your community engagement platform. This way, members can communicate with each other through forums, make posts, and browse other members’ profiles. These tools allow members to make connections throughout the entire year, keeping them engaged continuously.

- Organize a member directory. Member directories are an essential networking resource that enables members to explore your association’s member base and reach out to one another. Additionally, associations can show off the size and caliber of members in their directory to promote their organization.

Many individuals join associations specifically to be part of a professional community. Relationships with others in their industry can keep members engaged with your association long-term as they chat online, attend events, and collaborate with their fellow members.

### Member engagement and non-dues revenue

Many associations prioritize raising funds outside of their regular membership dues to continue funding and enhancing their services. Non-dues revenue can take multiple forms, such as sponsorships, online store sales, and additional paid member engagement opportunities.

Asking members to pay fees on top of their regular dues can be challenging, but it is possible if these paid opportunities are valuable, unique, and worthwhile. Just be sure your membership program also offers significant benefits so members don’t feel shortchanged if they choose not to pay for add-ons.

For example, event ticket sales are a great way to increase non-dues revenue. While tickets are an extra cost, events provide a rewarding experience that justifies the member’s purchase. Some associations may even host events open to the general public and offer members a discount on tickets to earn additional revenue and make the membership feel valuable.

## Top Association Member Engagement Strategies

Since every association is different, it’s difficult to definitively say which association member engagement strategy you should follow. Depending on your ultimate goal and members’ preferences, your member engagement strategy should be built around your specific KPIs and data metrics.

However, there are a few common strategic moves that can help to strengthen any member engagement approach.

### 1. Send out member engagement surveys.

Always establish a direct line of communication between your association’s team and your members to gather feedback. Whether it’s delivered through a social media platform, mobile events app, or email marketing tool, regular surveys and polls allow you to gauge your members’ thoughts and preferences.

When is the best time to send out surveys and polls? Consider sharing them:

- After events. Shortly after events wrap up, follow up with surveys while it’s still fresh in members’ minds.

- With membership renewal reminders. It makes sense to request feedback as members decide whether or not to renew. If members decide to leave your association, ask them why.

- At the end of the year. The end of the year is generally a time for reflection, and associations can use this as an opportunity to ask members to provide feedback on their experiences that year.

To encourage members to complete future surveys, send respondents a quick thank-you email. Additionally, follow up with any strategic changes your organization makes based on common points of feedback to show that you take members’ comments and suggestions seriously.

### 2. Segment your members by interests.

Not all members will feel engaged by the same activities. Segment your members based on relevant characteristics, such as their professional interests, membership tier, and how long they’ve been with your association. Then, create communication cadences for each group focusing on their unique interests.

For example, a professional association might divide members into job-seekers and current professionals. Communication for these two groups might look like this:

- Job-seekers. Promotion for skill-training courses, recommendation to sign up for your membership program, suggested network connections, and alerts when new openings are added to your job board.

- Current professionals. Promotion for upcoming conferences, invitations to a lecture with multiple industry professionals, recommendations to read an article on new industry developments, and encouragement to share their thoughts through community posts.

While these groups of members may enjoy activities geared toward the other, such as everyone participating in networking, dividing audiences helps guide members toward the content that is most likely to engage them.

### 3. Use advertising to promote engagement opportunities.

After crafting meaningful member engagement opportunities like members-only events and learning opportunities, you need your members to know about these opportunities. Paid advertising is a fantastic way to amplify member perks and inspire people to engage.

For nonprofits with membership programs, here are a few paid advertising strategies to promote member engagement:

- Google Ads: Use Google Ads to promote your website and encourage members to explore online resources like webinars, educational materials, and discussion forums. You can also promote your events. Best of all, eligible 501(c)(3) organizations can leverage this paid advertising channel for free through the Google Ad Grant program.

- Social media ads: Show up in members’ news feeds by running ads for upcoming events, membership drives, and other initiatives to encourage participation. By using targeting features, you can reach current and potential members alike.

- Retargeted ads: Reconnect with users who have previously engaged with your website or social media content. Whether they abandoned your membership form or an event registration form, you can inspire them to complete specific actions personalized to their interests.

Paid ads can be immensely helpful in engaging current members and inspiring new prospects to sign up. With thoughtful strategies, you can increase visibility for your initiatives, deliver ads to the right audiences, and drive more traffic to your site and social media.

### 4. Improve your communication strategies.

Members signed up for your association because they want to engage with your content. To get a positive response, you need to communicate with them in a way that fits their preferences.

Improve your communication strategy by:

- Letting members choose their preferred mode of communication. Take a proactive approach by asking members for their preferences. This might be email, text message, or through your online community platform. After members share their preferences, only reach out to them through that channel.

- Leverage data. Explore previous engagement data to determine which channels a particular member responds best to. You may also check what times of day they tend to respond to messages and base your communication strategy off of that.

- Personalize messages. Segment your members and tailor each message based on their particular preferences and engagement histories. You can do this by customizing existing templates within your AMS platform to personally address each recipient.

If you’re not sure what types of messages members will respond positively to, take time to experiment. Change up your communication style, the types of messages you send, and what platforms you use. Then, look at the results of your tests and base future outreach strategies on that data.

### 5. Host engaging events.

One of the most appealing parts of joining an association is the events. In-person meetings help members build connections and form a community around your association.

Most associations host a handful of in-person events throughout the year and several virtual events. It can be challenging to make virtual events engaging, so try making your online meet-ups interactive by:

- Doing live polls. Let members influence your online events by launching polls and surveys members can respond to during the event. Gauge their opinion or familiarity on a topic, ask questions, prompt them to share ideas, or gather the topics they’d like the event to cover.

- Having active moderators. Your association should always have moderators in your events’ live chat. Direct these moderators to not just screen comments that don’t reflect your values but also to actively engage members by asking questions, highlighting insightful comments, and sparking conversations.

- Creating breakout groups. Ensure members don’t miss out on socialization just because they’re meeting online. Plan breakout group sessions in your virtual events to give members a chance to chat with one another about your event, bounce ideas off one another, or even engage collaboratively.

Ensure your association management software has adequate event hosting software to accommodate virtual events. Promote your event regularly in advance to drive attendance.

### 6. Make new members feel welcome and existing members feel valued.

Your member engagement strategy should start on day one. As soon as a member joins your association, focus on engaging them. Send a welcome packet containing relevant association information about how to access your association’s benefits, such as login information for your online portal and information on any upcoming events.

However, don’t forget about those who have stayed loyal to you over the years. Tenured members should still feel valued, as their continual contributions and engagement are vital to your association’s longevity. Maintain positive member engagement by continuously communicating your appreciation for their membership.

### 7. Offer many ways to engage.

Don’t focus on just one method of member engagement. While it’s wise to have a goal for your association to work toward, don’t let other engagement opportunities fall by the wayside.

To get started, here are some digital member engagement opportunities:

- Online member portal. Provide a space for members to connect with others in their community. This should be a social media-like platform where members can post content, comment on each other’s posts, and directly message one another.

- Community message board. Members can actively engage with each other through forums, collaborate on files, and comment on each other’s ideas.

- Learning management system. With an LMS, you can offer online courses for members to further their education and gain certifications.

Also, remember the value of face-to-face engagements. Consider these in-person member engagement opportunities:

- Events. Host conferences, presentations, and more to engage your members in person. This way, they can interact with each other throughout the event and make face-to-face connections with their fellow members.

- Learning opportunities. Offer in-person classes and learning events for members to further their education.

- Meetings. Oftentimes, your association will have committees and subsections. Encourage them to meet in person on a regular basis so that they can efficiently accomplish objectives.

### 8. Foster a sense of community.

Make networking easy by taking steps to foster a community. You can help members jumpstart their networking efforts by:

- Creating a mentorship program. New members may be overwhelmed when first joining your association and unsure about how to start networking. Help them overcome this hurdle by asking long-standing members to serve as mentors. Connect new members with these mentors to ensure they have someone they can ask questions to and who will be a friendly face at their first in-person events.

- Hosting an online community. Maintain a vibrant online community to ensure members can connect with each other outside of in-person events. Encourage members to make posts of their own and interact with other members’ content. This can spark conversations in a low-stakes environment that lead to meaningful professional connections.

- Recommending suggested connections. Help members find like-minded individuals by suggesting other members for them to connect with. For example, some associations even help facilitate member meet-ups by asking members to fill out a survey with questions about their interests and professional goals. Then, the association matches them with another member based on their responses and offers to set up a video call or invites them to chat with each other online.

Ultimately, your goal is to get members to engage one another. Your association’s job should be to set up events and create content that invites members to connect with each other and continue those connections long after your planned activities wrap up.

### 9. Encourage user-generated content.

How do casual online communities continue to operate for years without any formal organization running them? These casual groups understand the value of user-generated content and rely on their members’ own creativity and enthusiasm to spark engagement.

User-generated content is any type of content made by your members. It can take several forms, such as:

- Blog posts

- Research reports

- Video blogs

- Illustrations

- Photos

- Discussion-starting questions

Essentially, if your members create it and it’s related to your association, it’s user-generated content. By encouraging these activities, you also encourage your community to engage one another, sustaining your association long-term.

### 10. Make it easier with an association management system.

To compete with other organizations vying for your members’ time, money, and attention, relying on software has become more of a necessity than a suggestion.

As members flock to your growing association, ensure that each individual gets the same level of attention and continues engaging with and participating in your organization. But how can you effectively engage your members when you and your staff are bogged down by daily internal processes?

By investing in the right association management software solution, you can automate the upkeep of daily tasks, streamline communications, and closely monitor and analyze your various engagement activities.

## Member Engagement Ideas for 3 Types of Members

Your association’s members typically follow a distinct membership lifecycle. Generally, the cycle is made up of five components: awareness, recruitment, engagement, renewal, and reinstatement.

<!-- Unsupported block type: image -->

The five components of the membership lifecycle which can be used to inform your member engagement strategy.

Members will respond to your engagement strategies differently depending on which phase they are in—for example, you wouldn’t invite a member of three years to a welcome happy hour. Instead, associations should target different types of members with tailored engagement opportunities.

Here are ways you can engage three different types of members:

### New members

A new member is one that was recently recruited by the association. They are very new to the organization and likely still need help navigating your membership portal and getting to know fellow members. These members fall into the recruitment and/or early engagement stages of the membership lifecycle.

Here are some ways to engage new members:

- A welcome email series. Put together a set of emails that is sent to any new member, triggered by the new member completing the enrollment process. These emails should have clear and engaging subject lines and include instructions for setting up any necessary accounts, an onboarding checklist, contact information for members who can help them get acquainted, and links to important association resources.

- Onboarding webinars. In addition to an email series, you might create a webinar that walks through the basics of getting set up at your association. The webinar should also touch on the exclusive benefits offered by the association to spread awareness.

- Mentorship programs. Help members get to know their peers by pairing them with another member to mentor them. The program can last anywhere from six months to a year or more. Make sure the mentors you choose are knowledgeable about the association’s offerings.

At this stage, it’s key to make a positive impression on members, teach them to navigate the association, and help them make relationships with peers. Additionally, make sure to share all of the benefits and opportunities that they can take advantage of as a member, such as earning certifications.

### Current members

Current members are those who have passed the initial onboarding stage. This can include those who have already renewed their membership in previous years or first-year members who fall between onboarding and renewal. In the membership lifecycle, these members fall within the engagement phase.

To engage current members, leverage the following engagement strategies:

- Advanced learning opportunities. Promote any online courses, certifications, and/or interactive workshops your association has, and, if possible, create more based on members’ interests. To engage your more senior members, make sure these go above and beyond common knowledge in your industry.

- Member-generated content. Give members the chance to create and share content about their areas of expertise. For example, if a member of your restaurant association is passionate about preventing burnout and protecting the mental health of cooks and chefs, offer to have them create a blog post and host a special webinar about the issue.

- Leadership opportunities. Your most dedicated, involved members are the most likely to volunteer their time to your association by taking on leadership roles. Share about these opportunities in targeted emails and promote the importance of and benefits of holding these roles.

These members are often looking for ways to get more from your association, so make sure your engagement strategies go beyond the surface level. Additionally, remember to collect feedback from members about your association’s offerings, implementing suggestions that are feasible. This shows that you care about members’ opinions and want to create value that appeals to them.

### Members at risk of lapsing

Members who are at risk of lapsing are those who are nearing the renewal period. During this time, they’ll decide whether they want to pay for another year of membership. Renewals are like a vote of confidence in your association, and they make up an important part of your revenue.

While your association may already send out messages prompting members to renew, you can take it a step further by reminding members of the benefits associated with being a member. Consider engagement strategies such as:

- Providing a customized value proposition. Using your association management software, create a segment comprised of members who are approaching renewal. Then, further segment those members by interest and send customized value propositions that highlight the benefits related to their preferences.

- Offering exclusive discounts. To motivate members to renew as quickly as possible, offer early renewal discounts. For example, set a deadline one month before their renewal date and offer 10% off the next year’s membership if they renew in time.

- Extending member appreciation benefits. Show that you value current members’ investment in your association. You might send eCards for milestones or birthdays, acknowledge members who have been with your organization for long periods of time or offer digital badges displaying how many years they have been active.

- Allowing members to opt into auto-renewal. Using your association management system, you can give members the option to set up auto-renew. This way, they don’t have to worry about manually renewing their membership each year. Just make sure to send out a notification letting them know their membership is about to renew.

Keep in mind that you likely won’t retain every member, and that’s okay. For any members who cancel their membership, send a survey asking why they decided not to renew. These answers should give your association a solid starting point when making updates and improvements to its benefits and engagement tactics.
