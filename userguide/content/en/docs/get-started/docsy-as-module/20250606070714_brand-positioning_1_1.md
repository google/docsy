The aim of Brand Positioning is to place the brand at the forefront of a consumer’s preferences when they consider the answer to a specific requirement they may have. Effective brand positioning highlights the distinctive attributes of the product or service and the values you want to stand for to gain brand salience.

A brand positioning statement helps a business to recognise who the target market is, and allows the business to think about how it wants the target market to perceive the brand.  A business should write its brand positioning statement before starting to market its products or services.
