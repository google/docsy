As we maintain Zendesk, when an Personal Data Requests involves the deletion of an account, we will be notified by the team member working the issue.

When this occurs, you will need to delete the user's account in Zendesk. For information on doing that, please see [Deleting End-users](../docs/zendesk/end-users#deleting-an-end-user)

There is no need to "permanently delete" the user, as we have automated processes in place to do this for you.

After you have done so, ensure you update the issue in question to indicate this has been done.
