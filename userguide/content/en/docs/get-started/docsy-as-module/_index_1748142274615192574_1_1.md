## Summary

This blueprint proposes consolidating our evaluation tooling
[ELI5](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ai-powered/eli5) and
[Prompt Library](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/ai-model-validation-and-research/ai-evaluation/prompt-library)
to create a unified evaluation solution and an accessible way for teams to efficiently evaluate their
AI-powered features. As the main outcome, the blueprint presents the idea of merging ELI5 and Prompt Library
into the Prompt Library repository and ultimately transforming Prompt Library into an engine, retaining the
best features of both products.

## Motivation

Over time, GitLab developed two evaluation tools that address the same problem of evaluating AI features but
solve this problem differently: Prompt Library, focused on dealing with large scale evaluation, and ELI5,
focused on allowing developers to run quick evaluations.

### Overview of Prompt Library

Prompt Library is a feature-rich evaluation tool primarily designed for large-scale evaluations and managing
large datasets. It was built based on Apache Beam and can be run both locally or in a GCP project using the
Dataflow executor. The diagram below demonstrates the internal design of Prompt Library:

[Diagram source](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1qu2SwxCOmYYAk0wd3OWdg6R60pbq-jJrM_5Pzo_WIBM/edit?usp=sharing)

Prompt Library provides a CLI interface to run Apache Beam evaluation pipelines that read datasets from
BigQuery tables and output results back to BigQuery. Prompt Library supports a rich configuration system
through JSON configuration files that allow engineers to tune various parameters related to LLM judges and
other heuristics.

**Limitations:** Prompt Library components are tightly coupled to the Apache Beam API. Any evaluator requires
a deep understanding of the Apache Beam API and BigQuery. Please note that Apache Beam is initially designed
for scaled processing, and its programming logic may differ from pure Python development. For example, Apache
Beam doesn't support sorting in the classical sense. This complexity in extending and updating Prompt Library
components is currently causing confusion among teams and creating a barrier to adoption for simpler
evaluation tasks.

### Overview of ELI5

ELI5 is an evaluation tool built on top of LangSmith, primarily designed for fast prototyping and building
evaluation pipelines with less complex component interaction. ELI5 runs locally and requires developers to
clone the repository and install dependencies using `poetry`. If developers need to run ELI5 remotely, they
need to perform additional manual steps. The diagram below demonstrates the internal design of ELI5:

![ELI5 High Level](/images/handbook/engineering/architecture/design-documents/ai_evaluation_consolidation/eli5-high-level.png)

[Diagram source](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1LAYQP1eYF9Ibo0IRk3mu37prEHxUMIKilm1eqhHocqI/edit?usp=sharing)

Similar to Prompt Library, ELI5 provides a CLI interface to run evaluations, reading data from LangSmith and
outputting results back to LangSmith. LangSmith provides a rich UI that allows developers to effectively
analyze results and compare experiments to identify metric drift. The ELI5 CLI supports passing arguments to
configure evaluation pipelines. Most of the arguments have default values to reduce the burden on developers
and provide earlier results. To further help developers with prototyping evaluation pipelines, ELI5 provides
basic building blocks to build evaluators with a unified signature, that is, compare actual output with
expected. Depending on the developer's use case, these evaluators can be a pure Python function, LLM judge, or
another LangChain runnable.

**Limitations:** ELI5 solely relies on LangSmith and is limited by its capabilities. ELI5 helps developers
efficiently implement evaluators; however, the execution is out of our control, which may be required for
advanced use cases.

### Conclusion: Moving Towards a Unified Evaluation Approach

Developing both projects simultaneously is inefficient. It increases the need for maintainers, which is
already a bottleneck, and creates barriers for contributions. Additionally, it fosters unnecessary competition
and repetition between the tools.

Both projects have their own pros and cons. Prompt Library is a powerful tool for custom evaluation at scale
but is not flexible for company-wide contributions and adding new changes. On the other side, ELI5 is a
user-friendly solution focused on building the evaluation logic with LangSmith UI support to investigate
results. At the same time, ELI5 is limited to the LangSmith platform in terms of using it as an engine.
Therefore, consolidating our evaluation tooling is important to keep delivering high-quality results.

## Goal

Consolidate evaluation tooling to provide a user-friendly and transparent way for teams to evaluate their
AI-powered features.

## Objectives

Based on the goal and motivation, we define the following objectives:

1. Integrate ELI5 into Prompt Library by converting Prompt Library into an engine: This integration is crucial
   for creating a unified, powerful, and user-friendly Centralized Evaluation Framework (CEF). The goal is to
   create a flexible foundation that allows developers to focus on building pure Python function evaluators
   and running them on the Prompt Library engine, similar to LangSmith.

1. Enhance flexibility, extensibility, and user-friendliness: This objective ensures that the consolidated
   tool is adaptable to diverse needs and accessible to developers with different skill sets. The result is
   reducing barriers to entry but offering the power and flexibility to meet the diverse needs of different
   teams, from quick prototyping to extensive evaluations.

1. Improve documentation and user guidance: Clear documentation and user guidance are essential for successful
   adoption and effective use of the consolidated tool. This reduces the learning curve, minimizes user
   errors, and enables teams to leverage the full potential of the evaluation capabilities.

As an outcome, the consolidated tool after completing the defined objectives can be represented as follows:

## Non-goals

### Dataset management

Dataset management and creation are not considered primary objectives within the scope of this proposal. These
aspects are addressed in a separate issue:
<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/ai-model-validation-and-research/ai-evaluation/prompt-library/-/issues/349>.
In this proposal, we assume that the necessary data for running evaluations is already available in the
dataset Single Source of Truth (SSOT), which is accessible to the consolidated solution.

### AI Gateway integration

Centralizing model access through AI Gateway enhances consistency, reduces maintenance overhead, and minimizes
the risk of errors associated with managing multiple model access points. Connecting AI Gateway may improve
overall system reliability and efficiency. However, integrating AI Gateway into the consolidated tool doesn't
appear to be a strict requirement to achieve the main goal. We plan to explore this task further once ELI5 and
Prompt Library are successfully integrated.

### Apache Beam as Prompt Library executor

Prompt Library relies on Apache Beam to run the evaluation pipelines. Apache Beam was originally designed for
other tasks such as processing at scale and therefore is sometimes a bottleneck when implementing evaluation
logic. The Model Validation group has already been looking into replacing Apache Beam with another solution to
run the evaluation pipelines. However, to better manage technical debt at this stage and consolidate tooling
with fewer code base changes, we have decided to continue using Apache Beam. We are designing the consolidated
tool in a way that keeps evaluators simple and decoupled from the Prompt Library's internal logic. This
approach will allow us to revisit the rationale behind using Apache Beam once we complete the consolidation
work.

## Implementation steps

This section describes the implementation steps we need to perform to achieve the objectives defined in the
previous section. Please note that we define the implementation steps following
[GitLab Values](/handbook/values/) - Collaboration, Efficiency, Iteration, and Transparency. Every step can be
later converted into an epic or an individual issue depending on complexity.

### 1. Move ELI5 as a folder into the Prompt Library repository

This step consolidates code without immediate alterations, facilitating the identification of duplicate code
and reducing the number of required maintainers. It also increases the visibility of Prompt Library while
maintaining existing functionality for current users of both tools.

The process involves relocating the ELI5 folder structure into the Prompt Library repository and updating
documentation to reflect the new repository location.

**User Impact:**

- Existing functionality remains unchanged for both ELI5 and Prompt Library users.
- ELI5 users clone the Prompt Library repository instead of the separate ELI5 repository.
- The ELI5 repository is archived and no longer receives new updates.

**Estimated time:** < 1 milestone.

### 2. Convert Prompt Library into an engine

This step focuses on preparing the Prompt Library code base for integration with the existing ELI5 logic. The
goal is to convert Prompt Library into a basic engine that accepts ELI5-compatible evaluators.

The process involves updating the Prompt Library code base, providing a Python API similar to LangSmith used
by ELI5. This conversion allows developers to focus on pure evaluation logic without needing to interact
directly with Apache Beam. We aim to keep Prompt Library's key strength, that is, customization and running at
scale.

**User Impact:**

- Existing functionality remains unchanged for both ELI5 and Prompt Library users.
- Prompt Library maintainers need to support the previous old highly-coupled evaluation pipelines, fixing
  bugs only.
- If new evaluation logic needs to be implemented, developers implement ELI5-compatible evaluators and use
  them with the new Prompt Library engine.

**Estimated time:** 1-1.5 milestone.

### 3. Power existing ELI5 evaluators with the Prompt Library engine

This step adds an additional option for ELI5 developers to run their existing evaluators with the Prompt
Library engine. By completing this step, we connect the ELI5 codebase to Prompt Library, allowing developers
to prototype their evaluation pipelines quickly and also implement advanced custom logic if required.

This process involves updating the ELI5 codebase to include an option of triggering the Prompt Library engine.

**User Impact:**

- Existing functionality remains unchanged for both ELI5 and Prompt Library users.
- ELI5 users receive an additional option to run evaluators on the custom Prompt Library engine if they
  require.
- ELI5 users interact with Prompt Library as an engine using the Python API similar to LangSmith.

**Estimated time:** 1 milestone.

> Note: This step can be implemented in parallel with converting Prompt Library evaluators to be ELI5
> compatible.

### 4. Convert Prompt Library evaluators to be ELI5 compatible

This step converts the existing Prompt Library evaluators to be ELI5 compatible. The goal is to streamline
existing old logic, further merging code bases and mitigating any differences between the two approaches.

This process involves updating the Prompt Library code base. ELI5 already provides basic building blocks to
implement various evaluators, including pairwise evaluators or LLM judges. These building blocks can be reused
to make corresponding changes to the existing Prompt Library evaluators.

**User Impact:**

- Existing functionality remains unchanged for both ELI5 and Prompt Library users.
- Prompt Library maintainers support the previous old highly-coupled evaluation pipelines, fixing bugs only.
- If new evaluation logic needs to be implemented, developers implement ELI5-compatible evaluators and use
  them with the new Prompt Library engine.

**Estimated time:** 1-1.5 milestone.

> Note: This step can be implemented in parallel with powering existing ELI5 evaluators with the Prompt
> Library engine.

### 5. Merging CLI interface

Both ELI5 and Prompt Library provide CLI interfaces but with different configuration systems created for
different purposes. This step ensures that developers run a single CLI interface with a configuration system
that provides default values to run evaluations and is also flexible enough for advanced usage when developers
need to update evaluation settings.

This process involves updating the CLI interfaces of both ELI5 and Prompt Library and creating a new
configuration system based on YAML files with examples and default configurations to support most of the usual
developer needs.

**User Impact:**

- Existing functionality remains unchanged for both ELI5 and Prompt Library users.
- ELI5 and Prompt Library start providing a single CLI interface to run evaluations.
- ELI5 and Prompt Library maintainers support the old CLI interfaces, freezing any additions.

**Estimated time:** 1 milestone.

### 6. Deprecate old ELI5 and Prompt Library logic

This step focuses on deprecating and removing the old evaluation pipelines and related components the
maintainers had to support in the previous steps. The goal is to start using the consolidated tool that
includes ELI5-compatible evaluators running on the Prompt Library as an engine, the modified CLI, and enhanced
configuration system.

**User Impact:**

- Developers start using ELI5 and Prompt Library as a consolidated tool, that is CEF.
- Developers rely on the new documentation and guidelines for working with the consolidated tool.
- Deprecated dependencies coming from the original ELI5 and Prompt Library projects are successfully cleaned
  up.

**Estimated time:** < 1 milestone.

## Alternatives

This section presents alternatives that we explored but didn't pursue due to the reasons specified.

1. Build upon ELI5 and archive Prompt Library ELI5 has attracted more contributors and better supports the
   current needs of our teams. Instead of merging ELI5 into Prompt Library, we could shelve Prompt Library and
   expand ELI5 with additional features. However, taking the learnings from ELI5, making Prompt Library more
   user-friendly is an easier task than applying the scale of Prompt Library to ELI5.

1. Archive ELI5 and Prompt Library and start from scratch. This would allow us to take the learnings from ELI5
   and Prompt Library without inheriting their technical debt. However, starting a new solution would take
   longer to implement and might still lead to unforeseen issues. This approach wouldn't necessarily save us
   from technical debt in the long run.

## Future evolution

This section presents future ideas we are considering after achieving the main goal of this proposal.

- Merge Prompt Registry and evaluation repositories. Currently, prompts are being migrated from GitLab-rails
  into the AI Gateway repo. This is already an improvement over the current setup, but having prompts and
  evaluations in separate repos is like having GitLab and GitLab unit tests in different repos. Tests
  (Evaluations) should be run in the same place as the code (prompts). We suggest further moving them
  together.

- Evaluation through pipeline CI An alternative user-friendly solution for running evaluations is through
  GitLab pipelines, as showcased in this prototype:
  <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ai-powered/custom-models/evaluations/-/jobs/7518078099>. Having a
  consolidated evaluation repository will simplify the implementation of such a feature.
