## Team Mission

The executive search team is responsible for leading the talent acquisition process for director and above leadership positions across GitLab.

## Contact Us

<i class="fa-brands fa-slack"></i> [#executive-search](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C052DPP03E0) on Slack (GitLab Team Members only)

## Team Members

- Rich Kahn - Director, Executive Search
- Zach Choquette - Executive Recruiter
- Sruthy Menon - Senior Candidate Experience Specialist

## Executive Search DRIs

During an executive search process, it is imperative that the roles and responsibilities are defined upfront to ensure a positive process and outcome.

For executive level searches, we have a Talent DRI and Hiring DRI.

- Talent DRI: member of the talent acquisition team assigned to lead the search
- Hiring DRI: hiring manager

**Talent DRI Responsibilities**

- Organizes intake meeting
- Defines the core search group, including external partners, if necessary
- Leads all calls, partners with EBA to the Hiring DRI to ensure correct group and attendance
- Defines interview panel and associated competencies
- Ensures interview process is followed and feedback is documented
- Lead for all steps in the recruitment process, including sourcing strategy, candidate engagement, candidate screening, next steps, references, offer negotiation and approvals. These responsibilities may vary if an external search vendor is engaged.

**Hiring DRI Responsibilities**

- Attends intake meeting and approves of direction taken at intake meeting
- Approves list of core group
- Attends all search team calls
- Approves interview panel and associated competencies
- Provides feedback and collaborates with the Talent DRI to move the process forward
- Delegates to Talent DRI to run effective, efficient process as outlined

## Role Identification and Assignment

**Identification of Opportunity**

The Director, Executive Search will be made aware of a job opening in one of two ways:

- Net New Planned Headcount: The role will be defined in the headcount plan received from finance, which includes a target start date.
- Backfill Headcount: The PBP team will make TA leadership aware of the backfill. The Director, Executive Search will then be responsible for confirming headcount approval and target start date with finance.

No role should be assigned to a Talent DRI before headcount approval has been confirmed with finance.

**Role Assignment**

After the role is identified and headcount approval is confirmed, The Director, Executive Search will assign a Talent DRI. The Talent DRI assigned to lead the search will be chosen based on capacity, level of role and functional alignment.

If capacity on the executive search team is lacking, a senior recruiter with functional expertise may be selected as the Talent DRI in close partnership with the Director, Executive Search. Senior TA leadership may also be assigned as the Talent DRI in specific circumstances.

Based on the target start date, the Talent DRI will work backwards by estimating time to fill and determine when to start the recruiting process.

At this stage, The Talent DRI is also responsible for [creating the Greenhouse req]({{< ref "req-creation#requisition-creation-process" >}}).

## Role Qualification and Intake

**Role Qualification and Preparation**

As part of the role qualification process, the Talent DRI and Hiring DRI will:

- Confirm the job family is up to date and accurate
- Select the core search group
- Select the interview panel and associated competencies
- Decide which recruiting strategy is best suited for the open role

In most cases, the role qualification and preparation can be done async. However, in certain situations where an external vendor is involved, the Talent DRI and Hiring DRI may choose to connect in a sync to discuss.

The Talent DRI will then take the lead on next steps in the recruitment process. In the event that a vendor is required (see decision parameters below), the Talent DRI will lead the process. Read more about this in External Vendor Selection(#external-vendors).

**Intake Meeting**

The intake meeting will be subsequently scheduled between the Talent DRI, external search partner (if applicable) Hiring DRI and core search group. EBAs to the Hiring DRI and executive shadows may also be in attendance at the Hiring DRI’s discretion.

Ahead of the intake meeting, the Talent DRI will conduct baseline research, to include:

- Talent Insights Reports
- DIB data and directions
- Sample profiles for candidate calibration

The Talent DRI is responsible for generating an intake meeting agenda and driving the meeting. The Director, Executive Search will maintain a meeting intake template to be shared with the Talent DRI.

## External Vendors

**External Vendor Selection**

It may be necessary for GitLab to engage a recruiting/sourcing partner (vendor) for certain executive level searches. It is the responsibility of the Director, Executive Search to maintain a list of approved vendors and work with the Talent DRI and Hiring DRI to select an appropriate partner for the search.

**Criteria for External Vendor Selection**

Engagement of an external executive recruitment vendor can be considered if any of the following is true:

1. The talent pool is best addressed by search firm networks rather than our internal executive search team. Typically this applies to C-Level (E-Group) searches, but may apply elsewhere on occasion.
1. Search is director level or above AND:
    1. Search is not on track after the Hiring DRI spent a minimum of four weeks sourcing a broad diverse set of candidates in collaboration with the executive search team, OR
    1. Search is not on track after the Hiring DRI spent a minimum of two weeks sourcing a broad diverse set of candidates AND there is no internal executive search team capacity to manage the search
1. Search is in a specific geography where GitLab is lacking necessary in-house expertise
1. There is a need for additional confidentiality that will be best handled by an outside party.

**Budget for External Vendors**

If the business chooses to use an external recruitment vendor for an executive search, the expense will come out of their budget.

**Process for External Vendor Engagement**

Once a role has been identified as eligible for an external search vendor and budget has been secured, the process is:

1. The executive search team will obtain vendor references where necessary or applicable. The Hiring DRI should not engage any vendor directly prior to this step.
1. The Director, Executive Search submits the budget request to the VP, Talent and Engagement and VP, Finance for approval.
1. The Talent DRI engages the vendor and involves procurement in the contract discussion. No work should be completed by the vendor before we have a signed agreement.

**Decision Framework for New External Vendors**

If a hiring manager wishes to use an external executive search vendor that is not currently on our approved vendor list, the process is:

1. If after discussion between the Director, Executive Search, Talent DRI and Hiring DRI, it is determined that there is no suitable approved vendor available for the search, a new vendor may be considered.
1. The Director, Executive Search will set up an informational call with the potential vendor, Talent DRI and Hiring DRI to discuss the search and assess the vendor’s ability to partner and deliver.
1. If the vendor is chosen to move forward, the Director, Executive Search engages the vendor and involves procurement in the contract discussion. No work should be completed by the vendor before we have a signed agreement.

## Communication Cadences

**Slack Channels**

At the onset of a search, The Talent DRI will set up two Slack channels:

- Core search channel: (#search-job-title). This channel will be the SSoT and communications vehicle for the search and will include the core search group.
- Panel search channel: (#panel-job-title). This channel will be for communication with the interview panel and broader stakeholder group that may include:
  - Core search group
  - Interview panel
  - EBA group
  - CES
  - People Business Partner

**Progress Calls**

- The Talent DRI will recommend communication cadences to the Hiring DRI. After the intake call, it is common to allow the recruiting process 2-3 weeks head-start prior to the first progress call.
- Progress calls are normally weekly (unless otherwise planned) and have the core group in attendance.
  - During the progress calls, the core group will cover:
    - Longlist and shortlist summaries (prospect candidate lists)
    - Interview feedback
    - Next steps for candidates
    - Any special timeline requirements of candidates, if applicable
- In addition, the Talent DRI is also responsible for providing relevant async updates to the search team via Slack channels

**Coordination Work Between Progress Calls**

The Talent DRI (in partnership with CES and the EBA to the hiring manager) will take the lead on any coordination necessary between arranged call cadences. SLA for next steps to be actioned between calls is 24 hours.

**Agenda Maintenance and Progress Updates**

The Talent DRI (in partnership with the vendor) is responsible for maintaining the progress call agendas and surfacing any urgent requirements via email and Slack to the relevant parties when necessary.

**Feedback Calls**

During the final stages of an interview process, it may be necessary for the core search team to meet and discuss feedback in order to make a decision. These calls will be coordinated by the Talent DRI and EBA to the Hiring DRI. The Talent DRI will gather all feedback ahead of the feedback calls and organize an agenda to facilitate the discussion.

## Confidential Searches

Certain executive searches may have the need for additional confidentiality. These may include:

- E-Group level searches
- Strategic roles
- Confidential backfills

These roles will be marked as confidential when opened in Greenhouse, and will be excluded from standard reporting. Special care will be given to limit access permissions to only essential stakeholders.

In certain circumstances when a role is highly confidential, the Hiring DRI and Talent DRI may choose to run the process outside of Greenhouse.

## Interview Process
