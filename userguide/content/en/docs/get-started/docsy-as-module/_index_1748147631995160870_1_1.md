title: Laptop Hostnames and Usernames
---

## Overview

You can choose any username you wish for setting up the local account on the Mac. By default the format for the host name is `Firstname's MacBook Pro`. For example, John's MacBook Pro, Jane's MacBook Air, etc.

## Mac User Account

When you set up your laptop for the first time, it will ask you to set up the local account. You can use any name that you wish, for the **username** it is a best practice to use your `{firstname}` (ex. `kate`) or `{firstInitial}{lastName}` (ex. `klibby`) and for the **display name** it is best practice to use title case (ex. `Kate Libby`).  Based on filesystem case sensitivity, it is recommended to keep your username lowercase.

## Mac Endpoint Naming Standard

When your Mac first connects to our automated systems, it will run a script to change the default host name. For more information on GitLab endpoint naming standards, please see this internal [handbook page](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/security/corporate/tooling/jamf/endpoint_naming_convention)

## Additional help

When contacting Corporate Security Helpdesk, you may get asked to confirm the hostname of your computer to ensure that we are helping you with the correct machine in our inventory.

By default, the terminal prompt will be your hostname. If you wish to change the terminal prompt, please see the detailed guide below.
