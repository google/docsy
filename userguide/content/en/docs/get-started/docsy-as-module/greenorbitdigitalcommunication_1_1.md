# Green Orbit Digital Communication

[Unsupported block type: table]
[Unsupported block type: table]
1. Remember we are a global company with significant time-zone differences. Unless there is a reason to do otherwise, ensure any time-sensitive calls to action or announcements are made when the whole company has enough time to action. Consider different timezones, non-linear work days, and PTO. Announcements should be made ideally 72 hours (at minimum 24 hours) in advance of a due date. This is to prevent APAC/EMEA team members missing important announcements posted outside their normal working hours. Sometimes a late announcement is better than none at all, and acknowledging those who will miss it might be a kind gesture, such as “Apologies to our APAC/EMEA friends for the late notice”.
### Posting in #company-fyi
Our company-wide announcements channel is **#company-fyi**. It is an **announcement only** channel, meaning that communications need to be approved before they can be posted. To minimize noise, announcements made in `#company-fyi` should not be duplicated in `#whats-happening-at-gitlab`. Be mindful of the [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy).
In order to post or have a message posted in `#company-fyi`, please reach out to [the internal communications team](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/employment-branding/people-communications/) or your function’s executive who can approve the message and post it.
Examples of what **should not** go in **#company-fyi** (as per new group guidelines):
- Competition prize winner announcements
- Org change or new team member announcements (unless they are E-group)
- Promotion of an optional non-company-wide internal event
- Announcement that directly impacts less than 75% of team members
- Actions required from team members is not critical or timely
**The above should all go in the new #whats-happening-at-GitLab channel** (formerly the `#company-announcement` channel).
[Unsupported block type: code]
### Posting in #whats-happening-at-gitlab
Due to the volume of posts in the Slack channel, we recommend that you do not use #whats-happening-at-gitlab as a sole location for important announcements as information might get lost or muted. Examples of important items include but are not limited to:
- Anything involving GitLab team member policy, such as changes in benefits, laws, review cycles, etc.
- Urgent matters that can’t wait for #company-fyi but still need to be communicated to everyone such as service outages or last minute event changes
## Meetings
### Common meeting problems
Meetings are incredibly expensive since they require synchronous time. The most common meeting problems can all be addressed by following the above guidelines around scheduling meetings. Some of the most common meetings problems are outlined below:
[Unsupported block type: table]
### Everyone is responsible for notes
If folks are involved in a meeting and have capacity to do so, they should take notes using GitLab’s [Live Doc Meetings principles](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/live-doc-meetings/). This is important, because:
1. Meetings at GitLab should have notes (for a single source of truth and to enable async participation among other reasons)
1. In the absence of this joint commitment to note-taking, this is the type of work that is likely to fall disproportionately to [underrepresented groups](https://amp-theguardian-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/amp.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/they-feel-guilty-why-women-should-say-no-to-office-housework). This is not in line with our [diversity, inclusion, and belonging value](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/inclusion/).
It may look like a few people are already taking notes, do not see this as a deterrent for helping. Initial note takers may be first to show up and then see it as their responsibility to continue if no one else is stepping in.
While meetings recordings are helpful, written notes are more efficient to read and offer greater opportunities for async engagement. Takes notes even when a meeting is being recorded.
### Engaging EBAs in note-taking
[GitLab Executive Business Administrators](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/eba/) sometimes support teams by taking notes. Since note taking takes time away from their other activities and can often be done by other folks, consider the following before engaging an EBA in a meeting solely for note taking purposes.
1. Can the folks already in this meeting cover note taking responsibilities, or is there a reason to engage an EBA in this capacity?
1. Can other folks be identified ahead of time or at the start of the meeting to ensure adequate coverage?
1. How does this stack against the EBAs other priorities? You can check directly with the EBA or their manager.
### Smart note taking in meetings
Note taking helps us to work asynchronously. Team members can add thoughts to an agenda in advance of a meeting and understand what was discussed if they cannot attend. It also offers a record of discussion.
Consider the following best practice when taking notes in meetings:
1. If at the start of the meeting, it does not look like all team members will contribute to note-taking, identify a set of note-takers who will be responsible for this activity within the meeting
1. Note-taking can be a lot for a single person to stay on top of–especially when there is a fast moving conversation with many speakers. Team members should still feel empowered to contribute by helping with notes as needed, even if there is someone assigned. 
1. Ask others to scribe answers in real-time to allow the person who asked the question to focus on the answer. Touch up the answer when the conversation has moved on to something less relevant.
1. It can be hard to keep up with the dialog and capture quality notes when there’s fast back and forth conversation. Lead by example and write when you’re not talking, expect others will write when you’re talking.
1. Focus on noting speakers and their key points over capturing all words said. Extensive note-taking should not happen at the expense of correct note-taking.
1. [Write down your questions](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#write-things-down) in the agenda before vocalizing. Always ask people to vocalize their questions to provide the most detailed context and for audio-only playbacks.
1. Use discretion in taking notes if sensitive topics are being discussed. For example, do not takes notes on [not-public information](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/confidentiality-levels/#not-public) if the agenda may be available to an audience who should not be privy to this information.
1. If someone requests folks to stop taking notes, stop for the duration of the discussion unless there is verbal confirmation that note-taking should resume. Ask for the confirmation before typing before you resume note-taking.
1. At the end of the meeting, clearly capture key takeaways, next steps, and [DRIs](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#what-is-a-directly-responsible-individual).
If you have any questions about what may or may not be a sensitive topic, please refer to our SAFE Framework or reach out via the `#safe` Slack channel
### Few meetings with presentations
[Presenting](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#common-meeting-problems) during meetings requires valuable synchronous time. Instead, recorded presentations make content accessible, prevent confusion, and increase participation for team members that prefer consuming content [asynchronously](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#bias-towards-asynchronous-communication). Remember it is not required to have a presentation or have a pre-recorded presentation.
In the video below, GitLab co-founder, Sid Sijbrandij, explains why there are no presentations in most meetings.
[Unsupported block type: video]
**Pre-recorded presentations enable:**
- Allows time for Q&A (as seen in [Group Conversations](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/group-conversations/#presentation), which enables attendees to have their questions answered without running out of time.
- Reinforces GitLab’s [Bias Towards Asynchronous Communication](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#bias-towards-asynchronous-communication) because it allows a distributed team to consume the presentation asynchronously.
- Strengthens [self-service and self-learning](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#self-service-and-self-learning) by maximizing the meeting time’s efficiency to ensure that team members have their voices heard during the Q&A.
- Standardizes the approach to meetings across the organization.
- Includes transcripts that can boost content value, help team members focus, and increase accessibility.
- Flexibility in viewing using rewind and playback speed adjustments.
- Encourages and enables greater participation from [neurodiverse team members](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#embracing-neurodiversity) who might take added time to process and reflect before asking questions.
- Allows for selective watching of presentation material for a certain period.
There are times when presenting during a meeting is needed. This may occur when adding more context to a specific topic on slides. If this is the case, consider the following:
- A presentation, with optional attendance and mandatory recording. This will allow clarifying questions to be asked and answered efficiently and enables team members to watch async.
- Include an async Q&A doc for team members who did not attend the presentation.
- Ensure the async Q&A doc is linked in the YouTube description.
**Best Practices for Pre-Recorded Presentations**
1. Use Zoom to create a pre-recorded video presentation.
1. Post the recording to the GitLab [Unfiltered YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A) and attach it to the meeting agenda.
1. At least 24 hours in advance of the meeting, announce in Slack Channels that the meeting has a pre-recorded video, and all attendees are advised to watch beforehand.
### Framework for meetings with presentations
While most meetings should not have presentations, there are a few exceptions. Specifically, we may use synchronous touch points in meetings with large numbers of folks. These tend to be meetings used for building team cohesion and alignment. For example, [GitLab Assembly](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/gitlab-all-company-meetings/) or the [Functional Leaders Meeting](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/offsite/#functional-leaders-meetings).
GitLab has the following meeting framework for determining which meetings should have presentations:
[Unsupported block type: table]
### Meeting introduction guidelines
Introductions can be helpful during some external meetings, such as executive sales calls. In those meetings, use these guidelines:
1. Agree ahead of time to do introductions so everyone is prepared for it.
1. Create a list of people with their roles in a shared agenda and use that for the introduction sequence.
1. Each person should introduce themselves so that everyone can see that person on Zoom.
1. The person introducing themselves hands it over to the next person in the agenda. Make sure you’re never screen sharing when people are introducing themselves.
### Scheduling meetings
1. Every scheduled meeting should either have a Google Presentation (for example for functional updates that don’t require participation) or a Google Doc (for most meetings) linked. If it is a Google Doc it should have an [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eH-adpjfyo_RnlfbPvJ3i0e1Qb-aVoNc4yajnkZgJcU/edit#heading=h.6upuyp25d0wm), including any preparation materials (can be a presentation). For a step-by-step guide on GitLab meeting best practices, visit our [Live Doc Meetings page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/live-doc-meetings/). 
1. For team members working in AMER timezones who regularly collaborate with EMEA team members: 
1. For team members working in AMER timezones who regularly collaborate with APAC team members: 
1. If you want to ask GitLab team members if they are available for an event please send a calendar invite with Google Calendar using your Google GitLab account to their Google GitLab account. When you add a GitLab team member as a “Guest” in Google Calendar, you can click the See Guest Availability button to check availability and find a time on their calendar. These calendar invites will automatically show up on all parties calendars even when the email is not opened. It is an easier way to ensure everyone has visibility to the meeting and member’s status. Please respond quickly to invites so people can make necessary plans.
1. If you want to check if a team member is available for an outside meeting, create a calendar appointment and invite the team member only after they respond yes. Then invite outside people.
1. When scheduling a call with multiple people, invite them using a Google Calendar that is your own, or one specific to the people joining, so the calendar item doesn’t unnecessarily appear on other people’s calendars.
1. If you want to move a meeting just move the calendar appointment instead of reaching out via other channels. Note the change at the top of the description.
1. Please click ‘Guests can modify event’ so people can update the time in the calendar instead of having to reach out via other channels. You can configure this to be checked by default under [Event Settings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings).)
1. When scheduling a meeting we value people’s time and prefer the “speedy meetings” [setting in our Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings). This gives us meetings of, for example, 25 or 50 minutes leaving some time to: 
1. When scheduling a meeting, please try to have it start at :00 (hour) or :30 (mid-hour) to leave common start times available for other meetings on your attendees’ calendars. Meetings should be for the time needed, so if you need 15 minutes just book that.
1. When creating a calendar event that will be used company wide, [please place it on the GitLab Team Meetings Calendar](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/#gitlab-team-meetings-calendar). That way the event is easily located by all individuals.
1. When you need to cancel a meeting, make sure to delete/decline the meeting and choose the option **Delete & update guests** to make sure everyone knows you can’t attend and don’t wait for you.
1. If you want to schedule a meeting with a person not on the team please use [Calendly](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/other-apps/#calendly). Use Google Calendar directly if scheduling with a GitLab team member.
1. **Materials Review** are scheduled as all day not busy events as a reminder three days before the scheduled call.
1. When scheduling recurring meetings, consider using **(UTC+00:00) Coordinated Universal Time** as the meeting time zone, so that the meeting time does not change for others when your local time zone changes.
### Cross-regional Working Hours Recommendations
If you’re scheduling a meeting across multiple regions, consider using the time ranges below to respect common working hours.
The suggested times are organized by the regions that you’re trying to accommodate. Each suggested window is shown in the local time zone. For example, if your meeting includes team members in EMEA and AMER, you could consider scheduling from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM Pacific Time.
Note: Time zone offsets change throughout the year due to Daylight Savings Time, Summer Time, and similar time changes, so these suggested times may be less convenient at different times of year.
### EMEA/AMER
[Unsupported block type: table]
### APAC/AMER
[Unsupported block type: table]

### Multi-session meeting naming
When scheduling meetings with two or more sessions (usually when trying ensure worldwide coverage for all team members), name them after the topic, appended with a session number based on the order they show up in the calendar. Team members will see the meeting invites in their email or calendar in relation to their local time zone and can decide for themselves which session to attend, based on their working hours.
Avoid:
- Terms like `friendly` or `early` / `late`, as these terms are overly subjective. An early meeting for one team member might seem late for someone in a different time zone. Or a west coast AMER meeting might seem “APAC friendly”, but not to someone in western APAC who is still asleep when the meeting starts.
- Using `AMER`, `EMEA`, `APAC`, or `only` unless the meeting is specifically targeting members of that time zone. These terms give the impression that only team members from those timezones are welcome, when people from any timezone with any working style are welcome.
For example:
[Unsupported block type: table]
### Video calls
1. Use video calls if you find yourself going back and forth in an issue/via email or over chat. Guideline: if you have gone **back and forth 3 times**, it’s time for a video call.
1. Sometimes it’s better to *not* have a video call. Consider these tradeoffs: 
1. Try to have your video on at all times because it’s much more engaging for participants. 
1. Additional points for video calls with customers or partners: 
1. We prefer [Zoom](https://gitlab.zoom.us/).
1. Google Calendar also has a [Zoom plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zoom-scheduler/kgjfgplpablkjnlkjmjdecgdpfankdle?hl=en-US) where you can easily add a Zoom link for a video call to the invite.
1. For meetings that are scheduled with Zoom: 
1. Consider using a utility to easily mute/unmute yourself, see [Shush](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/other-apps/#shush) in the tools section.
1. [Hybrid calls are annoying](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#hybrid-calls-are-annoying).
1. Always be sure to advise participants to mute their mics if there is unnecessary background noise to ensure the speaker is able to be heard by all attendees.
1. We start on time and do not wait for people. People are expected to join no later than the scheduled minute of the meeting (before :01 if it is scheduled for :00). The question ‘is everyone here’ is not needed.
1. It feels rude in video calls to interrupt people. This is a situation where we have to do something counter intuitive to make all-remote meetings work. In GitLab, everyone is encouraged to interrupt the speaker in a video call to ask a question or offer context. We want everyone to contribute instead of a monologue. Interrupting can be done by clicking “Raise Hand” in Zoom, by physically raising your hand on video, or by interrupting verbally. As a speaker, allow yourself to be interrupted. As a listener, advocate (verbally if necessary) for those who have raised their hand. Just like in-person meetings be cognizant of when, who, and how you interrupt, we don’t want [manterrupting](https://time.com/3666135/sheryl-sandberg-talking-while-female-manterruptions/).
1. We end on the scheduled time. It might feel rude to end a meeting, but you’re actually allowing all attendees to be on time for their next meeting.
1. Do not use the chat of products like Zoom to communicate during the call, use the linked document instead. Zoom Chat has been configured for a 30 day retention. This allows everyone to contribute additional questions, answers, and links in the relevant place. It also makes it easier for people in conflicting timezones to contribute questions before the call and makes it easier to review questions and answers after the call, which can be before watching the recording.
1. You do not need to remind other people to vocalize their questions. Just say their name and a keyword of the question, e.g. ‘Jay about credit-cards’.
1. Every comment is document worthy, even small support comments such as `+1` or `Very Cool!`.
1. We encourage the recording and [sharing of everything to our YouTube Unfiltered channel](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/youtube/).
1. It is unusual to smoke in an open office or video conference, vaping is associated with this. For this reason we ask that you don’t vape during calls, and if you absolutely have to, kindly switch your camera off.
1. Speak up when you notice something is not working. If you notice someone’s microphone, web cam or latency is causing issues for them it is good to speak up. On a video call it can be harder for the speaker to notice that they aren’t being understood compared to a face to face conversation. As such you will be doing them a favour by speaking up early to let them know that they are having a problem. Also see [Hear nothing say something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ5spXU5HbU) for further explanation.
### You are the manager of your attention
You are the manager of your attention, and you decide when you do or don’t pay attention in a meeting.
You will always have more work than time in your life. If you get invited to a meeting you don’t think you should go to, you should decline the meeting. It is better to cancel than to show up and not pay attention. 
On the other hand, not every part of a meeting is relevant, but it can sometimes be helpful to have more people in a call. If you only have one discussion point, if possible, try to reorder the meeting agenda to have your point first and then drop from the call. If you get asked a question when you’re not paying attention, it is an okay use of time to repeat a question every now and then. If training is required for one’s role, team members should plan to give the training full attention–especially if engagement in discussions or breakout rooms is required. If training is ’nice to learn’ or ‘optional’ for team members, multi-tasking can be done at the team members discretion.
We don’t use the first 15 minutes of a meeting to read the materials like they [do at Amazon](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2019/06/18/how-the-first-15-minutes-of-amazons-leadership-meetings-sparks-great-ideas-and-better-conversations/#6be165bd54ca). You can use the start of a meeting to review the materials for the meeting if you need to, given you do not have to be paying attention, but that should not delay the start of the meeting for the people that already have questions based on the materials. [Meetings start on time at GitLab.](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#scheduling-meetings)
Do not use your camera to signal you’re not paying attention; [cameras should always be on](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#video-calls).
### Do not ask meeting attendees to pay attention
There are too few hours in a week, so we expect each team member to [manage their attention](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#you-are-the-manager-of-your-attention). If you’re hosting a meeting, don’t tell people to give you their attention or stop multi-tasking. Respect each team member’s agency over their time. Instead of demanding attention, earn participants’ attention by organizing and facilitating meetings so they are compelling to attendees.
### First post is a badge of honor
You should take pride in being the first person to add a question to a meeting agenda, however unlike [the First post](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/first) meme we do want the first post to be more than just “First!”. The meeting DRI will be happy to see there is a question ready before to kick off the meeting. The Meeting DRI should remember to thank the person for asking the first question.
### Do not do a countdown before ending a call
Never do a countdown or say something like. “I’ll give it x seconds”, people are very unlikely to ask a question if you do that. Either ask for a question, wait for a question, or end the call.
### Hybrid calls are annoying
In calls that have remote participants everyone should use their own equipment (camera, headset, screen).
When multiple people share equipment the following **problems arise for remote participants**:
- Can’t hear the sharing people well
- Background noise since the microphone of the sharing people is on all the time
- Can’t clearly see facial expressions since each face takes up only a small part of the screen
- Can’t easily see who is talking since the screen shows multiple people
- Hard getting a word in since their delay is longer than for the sharing people
The **people sharing equipment also have problems** because they don’t have their own equipment:
- Can’t easily screen share something themselves
- Trouble seeing details in screen sharing since the screen is further away from them
- Can’t scroll through a slide deck at their own pace
- Sharing people can’t easily participate (view or type) in a shared document with the agenda and meeting notes.
The disadvantages for remote people are much greater than for the sharing people and hard to notice for the sharing people. The disadvantages cause previously remote participants to travel to the meeting to be in person for a better experience. The extra travel is inefficient since it is time consuming, expensive, bad for the environment, and unhealthy.
Theoretically you can have multiple people in a room with their own equipment but in practice it is much better to be in separate rooms:
- It is annoying to first hear someone talk in the room and then hear it over audio with a delay.
- It is hard to consistently mute yourself when not talking to prevent someone else’s voice coming through your microphone as well.
### Types of meetings
### Ask Me Anything meetings
[Ask Me Anything meetings](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/ask-me-anything/) can be a useful opportunity for team members to meet a new leader, learn more about an existing team member, or gain clarity on a recent change.
1. Format: AMAs use the whole meeting time for questions from attendees, answered by the host.
### Fireside Chats
Fireside chats are informal conversations between a host and a guest. The guest is typically a new leader, board member, or guest speaker. They are a useful opportunity to learn specific information about these individuals and their professional careers and personal interests. Fireside chats allow the audience to learn more about the guests in a casual and approachable setting.
Format: In advance of the call, the host will prepare questions and share them with the guest. During the call, the host will moderate the conversation with the guest, by verbalizing the prepared questions. There is specific amount of time reserved at the end of the agenda for questions from attendees.
### Walk and Talk calls
A Walk and Talk call is when team members step away from their computers and get outside for a meeting. The difference between a [coffee chat](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#coffee-chats) and a Walk and Talk call is that a Walk and Talk call be held with people that you interact with frequently at GitLab. It could be social in nature or focused on a specific problem/topic that needs to be discussed. If it’s a problem-solving focused discussion, the outcome should be captured in a merge request. It should not be used if the problem being discussed requires screen sharing or detailed note taking. There are great physical and mental health benefits to a walk and talk call. There are also benefits with [increased focus and creativity](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-a-walking-1-1-meeting). A Walk and Talk can also help prevent [Zoom fatigue](https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/05/11/zoom-fatigue-is-real-heres-why-youre-feeling-it-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/).
The team members can use Zoom on their mobile device with the audio only function, or call one another from their preferred mobile device. A walk and talk call should be agreed to in advance to ensure that the local weather is compatible for a walk in both locations and that the walk and talk call fits into both team members’ schedules. We’ve created a Slack channel #walk-and-talk-meetings where, if you’d like, you can share pictures from your walking meetings.
### Release retrospectives and kickoffs
After GitLab releases a new version [every month](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/), we have a 30-minute call a few days later reflecting on what could have been better:
1. What went well this month?
1. What went wrong this month?
1. What could we have done better?
We spend the first part of the retrospective meeting reviewing the action items from the previous month.
On the 8th of each month (or the next business day), we have a kickoff meeting for the version that will be released in the following month. The product team and other leads will have already had discussions on what should be prioritized for that release. The purpose of this kickoff is to get everyone on the same page and to invite comments.
Both the retrospectives and kickoffs are [live streamed to our GitLab Unfiltered YouTube channel](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/youtube/) and posted to our [Unfiltered YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A).
### Deep Dives
As GitLab continues to grow, sharing knowledge across the community becomes even more important. The [Deep Dives page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/deep-dives/) describes initiatives we are trying to encourage. This aligns with how we work since everything at GitLab is [public by default](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#public-by-default).
### Daily Sync Escalation Process
GitLab has a specific process to follow in crisis situations to ensure effective communications. Details can be found in the [internal handbook](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/daily-sync-escalation-process/).
## Presentations
1. All presentations are made in Google Slides using [our templates](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/#google-slides).
1. Please allow anyone at GitLab to edit the presentation (preferred) or at least comment on the presentation.
1. If the content can be public use File > Publish to the web > Publish to get a URL and paste that in the speaker notes of the first slide (commonly the title slide).
1. The title of every slide should be the message you want the audience to take away, not the subject matter. So use ‘Our revenue more than doubled’ instead of ‘Revenue growth’.
1. Slide titles should not be more than one line. Be concise in highlighting the key point that you want to make.
1. Do not add a period at the end of a title.
1. During introductions, make sure that nobody is presenting. We remember people better and have more empathy when we clearly see peoples faces and expressions.
1. At the end of the presentation, when you go to Q&A, stop presenting in Zoom. This way the other people can see the person who is speaking much better.
1. All presentations at GitLab should be based on screenshots of the handbook, issues, merge requests, review apps, and data from GitLab Insights and Sisense charts. In most cases it shouldn’t be needed to make content uniquely for the presentation. If you need something that doesn’t exist yet add it to the place it belongs and then copy it into the presentation. This way we can have a [Single Source of Truth](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#single-source-of-truth) for everything we do. By using screenshots you indicate to people you did the right thing and they can find the canonical source in the appropriate place. Having to find information by digging through old presentations doesn’t scale. Consider linking the screenshot to the original source.
1. Do not use cumulative graphs internally. For example total ARR, total user, total contributors, or total Merge Requests. Instead use IACV per dollar spend, users added per month, contributions per month, or [MR rate](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/performance-indicators/#development-department-member-mr-rate). Cumulative graphs can [hide trends](https://www.heap.io/blog/how-to-lie-with-data-visualization) and are [far more likely to be misinterpreted](https://measuringu.com/cumulative-graphs/). The only acceptable use of cumulative graphs is for external presentations where they are expected by the audience and commonly used.
1. When your presentation includes graphs or other data, make sure your graphs have clear titles and dimensions. Make sure your data has significant figures and labels. For example, use ‘January: 1.95M projects’ instead of ‘January: 1.95M’. Keep in mind that your audience may not have the full context, especially if they are reading the presentation asynchronously.
1. When giving a presentation, your commentary should not be a regurgitation of the words in the slide. The audience can read the slide for themselves; your commentary should focus on the most important takeaways.
### Video and presentation tips with Lorraine Lee
On 2022-01-20, the L&D team hosted [Lorraine Lee](https://linkedin.com/in/lorraineklee) for a live speaker series on video and presentation techniques in an all-remote workspace.
Key points addressed in the training include:
- **Increase your confidence on video** using lighting, visuals, and curating your environment
- **Keep your audience engaged** with movement, power words, and the think/do/feel matrix
- **Stay connected with your audience** by smiling, making eye contact, and framing yourself in video
- **Insert energy** by standing up, projecting, and using hand gestures

As you’re creating external or business content for GitLab, please refer to the [GitLab Content Style Guide](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/content-style-guide/). For technical content, you can reference [this word list](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/word_list.html).
This list offers additional guidance for written communication at GitLab:
1. Do not use rich text, it makes it hard to copy/paste. Use [Markdown](https://handbook.gitlab.com/docs/markdown-guide/) to format text that is stored in a Git repository. In Google Docs, use “Normal text” using the style/heading/formatting dropdown and paste without formatting.
1. Read our [Markdown Style Guide](https://handbook.gitlab.com/docs/markdown-guide/) for more information when using Markdown.
1. Do not use ALL CAPS because it [feels like shouting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps#Association_with_shouting). However, there is the [`#all-caps`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01BC085AVB)[ Slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01BC085AVB) for your good-natured shouting needs.
1. We use Unix style (`lf`) line endings, not Windows style (`crlf`), please ensure `.md text eol=lf` is set in the repository’s `.gitattributes` and run `git config --global core.autocrlf input` on your client.
1. When specifying measurements, please include both Metric and Imperial equivalents.
1. When mentioning currency amounts that team members may need to convert to their local currency (e.g. benefits, expenses, or bonuses), link those amounts to our [Exchange Rates](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#exchange-rates) section (e.g. [500 USD](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#exchange-rates)).
1. Monetary amounts shouldn’t have one digit, so prefer $19.90 to $19.9.
1. GitLab is an internationally diverse company. US-based team members should not refer to team members outside the US as “international”. Instead, use “non-US”. Please also avoid the use of “offshore/overseas” to refer to non-American continents.
1. If you have multiple points in a comment or email, please number them. Numbered lists are easier to reference during a discussion over bulleted lists.
1. When you reference an issue, merge request, comment, commit, page, doc, etc. and you have the URL available, please include it.
1. In making URLs, always prefer hyphens to underscores, and always use lowercase.
1. The community includes users, contributors, core team members, customers, people working for GitLab Inc., and friends of GitLab. If you want to refer to “people not working for GitLab Inc.”, just say that, and don’t use the word “community”. If you want to refer to people working for GitLab Inc., you can also use “the GitLab Inc. team”, but don’t use “GitLab Inc. employees”.
1. When we refer to the GitLab community (excluding GitLab team members), please say “wider community” instead of “community”.
1. All people working for GitLab (the company) are the [GitLab team](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/team/). We also have the [Core team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/core-team/) that consists of volunteers.
1. Please always refer to GitLab Inc. people as GitLab team members, not employees.
1. Use [inclusive and gender-neutral language](https://techwhirl.com/gender-neutral-technical-writing/) in all writing.
1. Always write “GitLab” with “G” and “L” capitalized, even when writing “GitLab.com”, except within URLs. When “gitlab.com” is part of a URL, it should be lowercase.
1. Do not use a hyphen when writing the term “open source” except where doing so eliminates ambiguity or clumsiness.
1. If an email needs a response, write the answer at the top of it.
1. Use the future version of words, just like we don’t write internet with a capital letter anymore. We write frontend and webhook without a hyphen or space.
1. Our homepage is [https://about.gitlab.com/](https://about.gitlab.com/) (with the `about.` and with `https`).
1. If you use headers, properly format them (`##` in Markdown, “Heading 2” in Google Docs); start at the second header level because header level 1 is for titles. Do not end headers with a colon. Do not use emoji in headers as these cause links to have strange characters.
1. Do not use acronyms when you can avoid them. Acronyms have the effect of excluding people from the conversation if they are not familiar with a particular term. Example: instead of `MR`, write `merge request (MR)`.
1. If acronyms are used, expand them at least once in the conversation or document and define them in the document using [Kramdown abbreviation syntax](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#abbreviations). Alternatively, link to the definition.
1. If you don’t know the meaning of an acronym, ask. It’s always ok to [speak up](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#share).
### Communicating dates and time
1. For external content, refer to the guidance in the [GitLab Content Style Guide](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/content-style-guide/#dates-and-times).
1. For internal content, use ISO dates: `yyyy-mm-dd`
1. For months, use `yyyy-mm`, so 2018-01 for January.
1. Refer to a year with CY18 (never with 2018) and a quarter with CY18-Q1 to prevent confusion with fiscal years and quarters. If the year is obvious from the context it is OK to use Dec 4, but not 12/4.
1. GitLab operates on a [Fiscal Year](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/#fiscal-year) offset from the calendar year. When referring to a fiscal year or quarter, please use the following abbreviations: 
1. For time formatting guidelines, refer to the [GitLab Content Style Guide](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/content-style-guide/#time-formatting).
1. Please remember that not everyone is working in the same timezone; what may be morning for you is evening for someone else. Try to say 3 hours ago or 4 hours from now, or use a timestamp, including a timezone reference.
1. Don’t use “EOD” or “end of day” (“COB” or “close of business”, “EOB” or “end of business”), unless you are okay with a deliverable being due at the end of [anywhere on earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth#:~:text=World%20map%20of%20time%20zones,it%20ends%20on%20Howland%20Island). Team members communicate across timezones, where “end of day” does not specify the exact date and time. When you want something due at a specific time, [communicate the date and time](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#communicating-dates-and-time) by when the request should be done, for example: `Please review before 2023-06-10 5PM PT`.
### Visuals
Many times an explanation can be aided by a visual. Whenever presenting a diagram, we should still allow everyone to contribute. Where possible, take advantage of the handbook’s support for [Mermaid](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#mermaid). If you are new to using Mermaid or need help troubleshooting errors in your Mermaid code, the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/) can be a helpful tool. Where taking advantage of Mermaid isn’t possible, link to the original in our Google Drive so that the diagram can be edited by anyone.
### Ubiquitous language
At GitLab we use [ubiquitous language](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html) to increase communication efficiency.
This is defined in [Domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) as: “A language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software.”
We use it for activities in GitLab, even ones not implemented in software.
By having ubiquitous words to identify concepts we prevent confusion over what is meant, for example we refer to [parts of our organization](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/structure/) as a function, department, or group depending on exactly what is meant.
Make sure that domains don’t overlap, for example [organization size](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/) and [deal size](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/) don’t reuse words to prevent overlap.
If a term is ambiguous don’t use it, for example our hiring team uses the terms `roles` and `vacancies`, but avoid the ambiguous word `job`.
Make sure that projects and working groups have clear and direct names. Prefer “CI Spend Reduction Working Group” to “Project Raven Working Group”.
Make sure that people can infer as much as possible from the word, for example our [subscription options](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/tiers/) allow you to know if someone is using self-managed or GitLab.com.
Make sure terms don’t overlap without clearly defining how and why, for example see our [tier definitions](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/tiers/#definitions).
Keep terms to one or at most two words to prevent people from introducing ambiguity by shortening a term. When using two words make the first word unique because people tend to drop the second word more often.
### MECEFU terms
MECEFU is an acronym for Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive Few words Ubiquitous-language.
You pronounce it: MessiFu. Think of the great soccer player Lionel Messi and his [kung fu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_martial_arts) or soccer fu skills.
We want to use MECEFU terms to describe a domain to ensure efficient communication. MECEFU terms have 4 characteristics that help with efficiency:
1. Mutually Exclusive: nothing is referenced by more than one term
1. Collectively Exhaustive: everything is covered by one of the terms
1. Few words: the longer terms are the more likely it is people will not use all of them and cause confusion, therefore consider two words as the upper limit for a single term. Avoid acronyms because they are hard to remember (we’re open to a few words to replace MECEFU as an acronym :)
1. Ubiquitous language: [defined above](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#ubiquitous-language)
An example of a MECEFU term is our [sales segmentation](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/):
1. Mutually Exclusive: There is no overlap between the numbers and there is a single dimension.
1. Collectively Exhaustive: Everything for 0 to infinite employees is covered.
1. Few words: Mid-market is a natural combination and SMB is abbreviated.
1. Ubiquitous language: We’re not using the word ‘Enterprise’ which already can refer to our Enterprise Edition distribution.
One nit-pick is that the Medium of SMB and Mid of Mid-Market sound very similar.
### Simple language
Simple Language is meant to encourage everyone at GitLab to simplify the language we use. We should always use the most clear, straightforward, and meaningful words possible in every conversation. Avoid using “fluff” words, jargon, or “corporate-speak” phrases that don’t add value.
When you **don’t** use Simple Language, you:  
• Confuse people and create a barrier for participants of your conversation. 
• Cause others to not speak up in a meeting because they don’t understand what you’re saying. 
• Are not inclusive of those whose first language is not English. 
• Do not add value with your words.  
When you **do** use Simple Language, you:  
• Get work done more efficiently. 
• Build credibility with your audience (your team, coworker, customer, etc.). 
• Keep people’s attention while you’re speaking. 
• Come across more confident and knowledgeable.  
**Here’s an example:** 
*Original sentence*  We’re now launching an optimization of our approach leveraging key learnings from the project’s postmortem.  
*A Simple Language sentence*  We’re creating a new plan based on what we learned from this project.  
Simple Language is important both when we’re speaking to other team members and when we’re representing GitLab to people outside the company.
- • Confuse people and create a barrier for participants of your conversation.
- • Cause others to not speak up in a meeting because they don’t understand what you’re saying.
- • Are not inclusive of those whose first language is not English.
- • Do not add value with your words.
- • Get work done more efficiently.
- • Build credibility with your audience (your team, coworker, customer, etc.).
- • Keep people’s attention while you’re speaking.
- • Come across more confident and knowledgeable.
Be sure to use Simple Language in written communications as well. Our handbook, website, docs, marketing materials, and candidate or customer emails should be clear, concise, and effective. Corporate marketing maintains guidelines on [GitLab’s tone of voice](https://design.gitlab.com/brand/overview/#tone-of-voice).

### Inefficient things shouldn’t sound positive
For example, do not suggest that you’re “working in real-time” when a matter is in disarray. Convey that a lack of organization is hampering a result, and provide feedback and clear steps on resolving.
Do not use a cool term such as “tiger team” when the [existing term of “working group”](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/working-groups/) is more exact. While cool terms such as these may be useful for persuading colleagues to join you in working towards a solution, the right way isn’t to use flowery language.
The last example is when we used ‘Prioritizing for Global Optimization’ for what we renamed to headcount reset. When we [renamed it](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/31101/diffs) we saw a good reduction in the use of this disruptive practice of moving people around.
### Using additional languages
Using American English as our standard language supports our values such as efficiency, results, and transparency. Careful use of another person’s language can be a celebration of diversity and build an atmosphere of inclusion.
The guidance in this section applies to written one-to-one communication, for example, merge request comments between an author and reviewer, not merge request descriptions or commit messages. Also keep the following in mind:
- Use of an additional language is optional.
- Stick to the few simple phrases in the table below.
- Always include the language used and a translation to English.
- Team members can choose to indicate the languages they speak in their Slack profile.
- When in doubt, use American English.
**Here’s an example:**

### Avoid using Git in Project Names
Avoid using *Git* in the naming of internal and external company related programs (BagGit, GitFit, Gitty, GitIt, etc.). Referencing Git creates an inaccurate perception that GitLab has a narrow focus. While GitLab started as a source control platform, it has become [The DevOps Platform](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/devops-platform/).
## Email
We have a low internal email culture, as we see greater efficiency in other forms of communication (e.g. Slack). If you are emailing, please use the following guidelines:
1. Send one email per subject as multiple items in one email will cause delays (have to respond to everything) or misses (forgot one of the items).
1. Always reply to emails by replying to all, even when no action is needed. This lets the other person know that you received it. A thread is done when there is a single word reply, such as OK, thanks, or done.
1. If you’re sending an email to a large group of people (or a distribution list), put those recipients in BCC (rather than in the “To” field) so that a reply all won’t ping hundreds of people.
1. If you forward an email without other comments please add FYI (for your information), FYA (for your action), or FYC (for your consideration). If you forward an external request with FYC it just means the person who forwarded it will not follow up on the request and expects you to decide if you should follow up or not, the terms comes from [movie promotion to voters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Your_Consideration_%28advertising%29).
1. Email forwarding rules are specified in the shared [*Email, Slack, and GitLab Groups and Aliases*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rrVgD2QVixuAf07roYws7Z8rUF2gJKrrmTE4Z3vtENo/) Google Doc accessible only to people in the company. If you want to be added or removed from an internal alias, change a rule, or add a forwarding email alias, please [suggest an edit](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6033474?hl=en) in the doc and [submit a new access request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Individual_Bulk_Access_Request).
1. Only Google Workspace domain admins are allowed to provision Google Groups and email distributions.
1. Emails are asynchronous, for example, if your manager emails you on a weekend it is fine to reply during the workweek.
1. If an email is or has become **urgent** feel free to ping people via chat referencing the subject of the email.
1. If you or your team needs to send an email to a group of team members, not grouped in a current [Google email group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/security-tools/report-gsuite-group-members), and specifically related to personally identifiable information (location, state, country, etc.) please contact a Total Rewards Analyst at total-rewards@gitlab who can create an email list from Workday data, with approval.
1. Where appropriate, consider using professional salutations including Hi or Hello and avoid colloquial expressions such as Hey, Oh, or Sup. Sometimes only the person’s name is suitable. The level of formality should often mirror the formality from previous messages when communicating with internal team members as well as external persons.
1. Try to always use a person’s name when starting or responding to a message, especially if there are multiple persons cc’d, so that the addressee knows you are addressing them.
1. Make sure all relevant letters and words that need capitalization are capitalized, such as the start of sentences or the word “I”.
1. Proofread your messages so that sentences are punctuated correctly, typos are fixed, and grammar is corrected. Consider using the really helpful [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) tool - this tool is great for both native English speakers and for those who use English as an additional language.
1. All messages and replies are signed with a professional send-off (ex. Best regards), your name, and your signature block.
## Slack
Slack is used for:
- Internal-only communication and announcements impacting all team members
- Company newsletters and team updates
- Asynchronous team standups, questions, and quick collaboration
- Informal communication
Use a [bias for action](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#operate-with-a-bias-for-action) to quickly move conversations that require collaboration and action out of Slack and into an issue.
Only 90 days of Slack activity will be retained, so Slack should specifically NOT be used for:
- Obtaining approvals
- Documenting decisions
- Storing official company records or documents
- Sharing personal or sensitive information regarding any individuals
Internal Slack messages between team members are still considered professional communication. Please do not use or add emoji’s to Slack that are of a political, religious or of a sexual nature. You can refer to the [Religion and politics at work](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#religion-and-politics-at-work) section of the handbook. When in doubt do not use or add the emoji. If you have any concerns about an emoji that was used, please reach out to the author or if you are not comfortable doing so please reach out to your [People Business Partner](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/people-business-partners/#people-business-partner-alignments).
There is a lot of information pertaining to Slack, as it is a critical part of GitLab’s communication. See the [Slack tools and tips page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/slack/).
### General guidelines
1. Everyone can contribute, and while opinions are important to provide perspective, we value [proposals](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#make-a-proposal) and [iteration](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration). If the subject is of value to the wider community, consider commenting on an existing issue or opening a new [merge request](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#start-with-a-merge-request) instead.
1. Use the `:white_check_mark:` emoji or similar to indicate an inquiry has been answered. Anyone can add the emoji. If you’re not sure, then feel free to leave it up to the person who asked. An emoji indicator is particularly helpful in channels where lots of questions are posted, such as `#questions`, and `#git-help`.
1. In general, you can think of emoji reactions as equivalent to body-language responses we use in real-life conversations, such as nodding your head as encouragement when a verbal (or in Slack, written) response might be too much. However, please be aware that use and understanding of emoji, like body-language, is not universal. Others may not communicate via those means the same way that you do, particularly those who are Autistic or otherwise neurodivergent. If in doubt, you can use text to clarify.
1. In both public and private channels, [threads](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organise-discussions-) are valuable for keeping conversations together. If you want to respond to a question or comment in a channel, please start a thread instead of responding below them in the channel. This helps to keep the discussion in one place where it is easy to follow, and reduces noise as each message in a thread does not result in an unread message for everyone in the channel.
1. Unless you’re in an active chat, don’t break up a topic into multiple messages as each one will result in a notification which can be disruptive. Use [threads](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organise-discussions-) if you want to provide extra info to the question/comment you posted.
1. If you are having a hard time keeping up with messages, you can update your preferences to have Slack email you all notifications. To change the setting, go to `Preferences > Notifications > When I'm not active on desktop...` and “send me email notifications.”
1. If you agree in a message to start a video call (typically by asking “Call?”) the person that didn’t leave the last comment starts the call. So either respond to the “Call?” request with a video link or say “Yes” and let the other person start it. Do not say “Yes” and start a call 5 seconds later since it is likely you’ll both be creating a video call link at the same time.
1. As an admin of the Slack workspace, if given the option to *“Disable future attachments from this website”* when removing an attachment from a message **this will block the link/domain from **[**unfurling**](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/slack/#unfurling-links-in-messages)** in the entire Slack workspace**. Be careful and deliberate when choosing this option as it will impact every user in the workspace.
1. When referencing a Slack thread in a GitLab.com issue, don’t *only* link to the thread. Not only will people outside of the GitLab organization be unable to access the content, but the link will expire after the Slack retention period expires. Instead: 
1. When selecting your Slack display name, please do not have your name in all capital letters as this is often [associated as shouting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps#Association_with_shouting) in written communications.
### Avoid direct messages
**Note:** We don’t use the term *private message*, because these *direct messages* are not inherently *private* like a phone call or private letter. The messages are potentially accessible by Workspace admins or via Backups. Slack refers to these types of messages as [direct messages themselves](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/212281468-What-is-a-direct-message).
When using Slack for work-related purposes, please avoid direct messages. [Direct messages discourage collaboration](https://web.archive.org/web/20140603034414/https://blog.flowdock.com/2014/04/30/beware-of-private-conversations/). You might actually be contacting the wrong person, and they cannot easily redirect you to the right person. If the person is unavailable at the moment, it is less efficient because other people cannot jump in and help. Use a public channel and mention the person or group you want to reach. This ensures it is easy for other people to chime in, involve other people if needed, and learn from whatever is discussed.
If someone sends you a work-related direct message, it is okay to let them know you’d like to take the conversation to a public channel, linking to this section of the handbook. The process might look something like:
- In the direct message: `Thanks for reaching out, that's a great question/idea I think the rest of the team could benefit from. I'm going to move this to #public-channel based on [our desire to avoid direct messages](/handbook/communication/#avoid-direct-messages)`
- In the appropriate public channel: `@Person asked "question" in a DM, pulling that out here if anyone else has input.`
- Answer the question in a thread on that channel message, allowing others to benefit.
If you find yourself getting a lot of direct messages that should go in a public channel, consider changing your Slack status to an attention grabbing emoji and set it to something like:
- `Please consider posting in a public channel before direct messaging`
- `Why direct message me when you can post in a public channel?`
If you must send a work-related direct message, don’t start a conversation with “Hi” or “Hey” as that interrupts their work without communicating anything. If you have a quick question, just ask the question directly, and the person will respond asynchronously. If you truly need to have a synchronous communication, then start by asking for that explicitly, while mentioning the subject. e.g., “I’m having trouble understanding issue #x, can we talk about it quickly?”.
### Do not use group direct messages
Use private channels instead of group direct messages. Group direct messages are very hard to maintain, track, and respond to. They also have a key limitation in that you can’t add people to the conversation. This is a hindrance to collaboration and transparency.
Consider whether the conversation can take place in a public channel. If not, please use a private channel instead. This channel may have a short-term purpose. It is acceptable to leave the channel and/or archive it if you are no longer an active participant or the channel is no longer in use.
### Why we track % of messages that are not DMs
For all the same reasons that we want to [avoid direct messages](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#avoid-direct-messages), [use public channels](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#use-public-channels), and be [handbook-first](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first/), we track the % of messages that are not DMs. As we grow headcount, we exponentially increase the lines of communication- 3 people have 3 communication lines, 4 have 6, and 41 have 820. As a result, there is a natural tendency for people to prefer private channels of communication. The intentions are good, as people are looking to reduce noise for others, but this can lead to the same problems as described elsewhere on this page, notably:
- Communication is siloed.
- As we grow, people may be reaching out to the wrong person.
- If you have a question, other people might have it too.
Slack is our primary source of chat communication and is where many personal interactions happen. We want to continue to encourage folks to build personal relationships with one another which will often happen over DMs.
We know that DMs will always exist. We don’t want to eliminate them. We set a target of Slack messages that are not DMs being at least 25% of messages. At the time that we set this target, it was <20% of communications.
Everything at GitLab is a work in progress, so if we see a culture shift where Slack is *not* where work is occurring, thus inflating the amount of communication that is personal that is occurring, we can always change this KPI, but the steady growth of Slack messages paralleling the number of team members does not seem to suggest that is the case.
The previous KPI (% of messages sent in public channels) was about public channels but since some necessary parts of the business occur in private channels (discussions around comp, hiring, talent acquisition- and we do A LOT of hiring), this version of the KPI makes more sense. Earlier in our history, 50% of all communication *was* in public channels.
**Note:** Some of these charts require data from a sheetload file that needs to be manually updated. To self-serve data for a chart with missing data, please visit Slack’s [workspace administration page](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/218407447-View-your-Slack-analytics-dashboard#pro-and-business+-1). It provides guidance on how to access Slack’s analytics dashboard for a particular workspace. If this data is required in the charts below, you can ping the #data channel for a refresh. If this becomes a common request, we may choose for the manual step to become regularly scheduled.
### Use public channels
- If you use Slack and plan to message 3 or more people, we recommend a channel for customer/issue/project/problem/partnership.
- Learn about [common channels and channel-naming conventions](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/chat/).
- If something is important but not urgent - like complimenting or encouraging the entire team - use email or post in the channel without `@`mentioning the team.
- It’s not rude to leave a channel. When you’ve had your questions answered or are no longer interested, feel free to leave the channel so it won’t distract you anymore.
- The usage of ChatBots for integrations can sometimes depend upon the name of the channel. You should consult the channel about such integrations before changing the name of commonly used/popular channels to avoid inadvertently breaking integrations.
### Be respectful of others’ time
Start by understanding what we mean by respecting time. We should err toward putting material into channels over DMs and public channels over private channels even though we understand that this will generate more messages that can be read by more people. Respecting time is not about reducing the overall volume of channel messages that team members receive. It’s about making sure that messages are targeted, expectations for asynchronous responses are clear, and we are communicating with consideration.
The following tips provide ways to work respectfully with others given this context, though is not an exhaustive list:
- If you’re only referring to someone, but don’t actually need their attention, and want to spare them from getting notified, spell out their name normally without `@` mentioning them.
- You also do not need to `@` mention someone if they are part of a Slack thread unless you need their attention (for them to review, respond, etc.), since Slack has a dedicated view for threads.
- Slack messages should be considered asynchronous communication, and you should not expect an instantaneous response; you have no idea what the other person is doing.
- Do not feel obligated to respond to Slack messages when you are not working.
- Feel free to send a colleague a link to these guidelines if the communication in Slack should be done **asynchronously**.
- **Please avoid using @here or @channel unless this is about something urgent and important.** In chat, try to keep the use of keywords that mention the whole channel to a minimum. They should only be used for pings that are both urgent and important, not just important. By overusing channel mentions, you make it harder to respond to personal mentions promptly since people get pinged too frequently. Additionally, if you are planning to `@mention` a specific team ([Slack User Group](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/212906697-Create-a-user-group#browse-user-groups-and-view-members)), consider the size of the group you are mentioning ([see group membership](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/security-tools/report-slack-group-members)) and the impact of pinging all of these people for the particular situation. If something is urgent and important: 
- If you are aware that your teammate is on vacation, avoid mentioning them in a high volume channel. It will be difficult to find the information or question when they return. If you need to ensure they refer back to the thread, ensure to send them a link to the relevant Slack message through a direct message.
### Questions
If you have a question that you can’t find the answer to in our handbook (or you need help finding something in the handbook) team members across the company are here to help. Go directly to the subject matter experts/source in the [designated slack channel](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/chat/) to ensure your question is addressed.
If your question doesn’t relate to any of the existing topics:
- Ask it in the `#questions` Slack channel
- Once you receive an answer, document it in the handbook and post the MR link in your question thread
- ✔️ once you’ve been helped
### When would GitLab use Corporate Export?
The times this feature would be used would be to comply with certain obligations. Corporate Export must be enabled by Slack in accordance with Slack’s policy, which can be found [here](https://slack.com/help/articles/204897248-Guide-to-Slack-import-and-export-tools).
Examples of instances where GitLab may need to use this feature may include, but are not limited to, those situations listed in [Slack’s documentation](https://slack.com/help/articles/204897248-Guide-to-Slack-import-and-export-tools).
### Are my direct messages and private channel conversations completely private?
No. The Slack Workspace Owner has the ability to export data from all direct messages and private channel conversations for the maximum retention period set by GitLab, which is currently set for 90-days. All messages that are older than 90-days cannot be exported by the Workspace Owner or any other Team Member at GitLab. While messages are not actively monitored, GitLab reserves the right to monitor its software for the reasons stated in its [Employee Privacy Policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/privacy/employee-privacy-policy/), including, but not limited to, the safety and protection of our Team Members, the protection of our intellectual property, and the exercise or defense of legal claims.
Please keep [GitLab values](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) in mind when communicating directly with other team members. If you have a confidential personal issue that you do not feel comfortable discussing via a business-provided internal communications tool, it is recommended to use a personal form of communication such as a text message or phone call. For additional questions, please address in the [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-ops/change-management/issues/3).

## Types of documents
### Google Docs
Never use a Google Doc / Presentations for something non-confidential that has to end up on the website or the **handbook**. Work on these edits via commits to a merge request. Then link to the merge request or diff to present the change to people. This prevents a duplication of effort and/or an out of date handbook.
Google Docs can be useful when rapidly [iterating](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration)/commenting/suggesting on the content, but if the content is meant to be long lived it should be moved to the handbook as an SSOT and deprecated with a link to the handbook page. If the content is short lived, e.g. one-time report that won’t be referred to beyond 2-3 weeks, it can remain in a Google Doc or [presentation](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#presentations).
### Pageless is the GitLab preferred format
Google Docs [Pageless format](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/11528737?hl=en) is the preferred format for company documents that won’t be printed. If you set your [default to Pageless](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/11528737?hl=en) then this will be applied to all future documents as well. If a document is likely going to be printed (for example, a contract) the older paged style is acceptable. See [Good practices and helpful tips](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#good-practices--helpful-tips) for help navigating the pageless format.
### Link sharing
If you *do* need a Google Doc, create one with your company Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) account and set the visibility, access controls and searchable flag according to the following guidelines.
The recommended defaults when sharing a document for GitLab internal purposes is setting visibility to **GitLab**, access to **Editor** and searchable **Can find in search results** to ensure everyone can contribute!
**Note:** To our knowledge, it is not possible to set the default to **Can Edit** and you have to change the permissions from **View** manually. We hope that Google adds this capability in the future.

Reference Google’s [documentation](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822?visit_id=637102981721473693-3129607436&p=link_sharing_options&hl=en&rd=1#link_sharing) on Link Sharing to learn more.
### Good practices & helpful tips
1. If you have content in a Google Doc that is later moved to the website or handbook, [deprecate the Google Doc](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#how-to-deprecate-a-google-doc).
1. When referring to a Google Doc or folder on the Google Drive in the handbook, refrain from directly linking it. Instead, indicate the name of the doc. If you link the URL people from outside the organization can request access, creating workload and the potential for mistakes. (In the past, linking a Google Doc has led to inadvertently opening the sharing settings beyond what was intended.) This also helps prevent spam from people outside GitLab requesting access to a doc when clicking its link. To save people time you can also [link to the search results page](https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=%22this%20is%20a%20link%20to%20the%20search%20results%20page%22) which allows people to quickly get to the doc without anyone being able to request access. If there are multiple documents showing up in the search, you may filter your [search link by adding the owner.](https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=%22this%20is%20a%20link%20to%20the%20search%20results%20page%22%20owner%3Aemail%40gitlab.com)
1. If you are having trouble finding a shared Google Doc, make sure you [Search <your domain>](https://support.google.com/a/answer/3187967?hl=en) in Google Drive.
1. In our handbook, if you find yourself wondering whether it is better to provide a public link to a Google Doc vs. writing out the content on the website, use the following guideline: Is this document frequently adapted / customized? If yes, then provide a link, making sure that the document can be *commented on* by *anyone* with the link. For instance, this is how we share our employment [contracts](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/). If the document is rarely customized, then provide the content directly on the site and deprecate the Google Doc.
1. If you want to quickly find where a team member’s cursor is in a Google Doc, click their icon at the top of the document and the app will jump you to the current location. This works in Sheets and Presentations as well.
1. You can set the notifications on a Google Doc so you only get emailed when someone tags you directly instead of getting emails for every comment. Click on “notifications” and select “Only yours”. By the way, when you create the doc, it defaults to All, but when you are just shared with it, it defaults to Only yours. There is [no global default](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/docs/1C3PZX1AY7Q/6EXXQKQSPCMJ).
1. You can find a template of the [GitLab letterhead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gN1Z2FHPIfPk7QLIey1KF9dR1yTl0R7QrMSb5_Iqfh4/edit) on the shared Google Drive. Please be sure to make a copy of the document to your Google Drive before customizing the template for your use.
1. If you want to have the Google Doc be readable to the public, do not change the sharing settings from ‘Editable by Everyone at GitLab’, [publish the document](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/183965) instead.
1. In all cases, the sharing settings (who a document is shared with, if it is visible to the whole company, etc.) on a Google Doc should be the single source of truth for the confidentiality of the document.
1. Avoid using your initials when adding content to Google Docs or referring to someone else. Use your full name, as Google Docs [Smart Compose](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9643962?hl=en) will auto-complete names for you, and display information about the GitLab team member on hover. It makes documents more readable and consumable, especially for people outside your team/department.
1. When there is a synchronous discussion about an issue or MR captured in a Google Doc, be sure to summarize the discussion into the issue or MR and link to the agenda item where it was discussed with a [bookmark](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/45893?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop). If the notes are [limited access](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/confidentiality-levels/#limited-access) or no notes were taken, please say so. This will ensure that interested GitLab Team Members can see both the summary and context of the discussion.
1. In the [pageless format](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#pageless-is-the-gitlab-preferred-format) you can use COMMAND+OPTION+SHIFT+J or **View–>Hide Comments** to quickly hide comments that reduce document width.
1. When using Google Docs, paste full URLs rather than linking text. [Chips](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/10710316?hl=en) are the one acceptable alternative when linking to another Google document. Advantages for using URLs rather than hyperlinks include: 
### How to deprecate a Google Doc
1. Add ‘Deprecated: ’ to the start of the title.
1. Remove the content you moved.
1. Add a link to the new location at the beginning of the doc/first slide/first tab.
1. Add a link to the merge request or commit that moved it (if applicable).
### Handbook page
Pages like this are part of the [handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/). The GitLab handbook is the central repository for how we run the company.
### Product documentation
[GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/) - `docs.gitlab.com` is where you can find documentation on GitLab, the product.
### GitLab repositories
`repository`/`repositories` are where files are kept under [source code management](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/source-code-management/). In most cases, requires MRs to merge. The Handbooks are in a repository, our code is in a repository, etc.
### READMEs
`README` - `README.md` files are what are shown by default when you browse a repository. Contains useful information to give context on what the project/repository are for. These can also be used for [user profiles](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/#add-details-to-your-profile-with-a-readme) as personal READMEs.
## Google Calendar
We recommend you set your Google Calendar access permissions to ‘Make available for GitLab - See all event details’. Consider marking the following appointments as ‘Private’:
- Personal appointments
- Confidential & sensitive meetings with third-parties outside of GitLab
- 1-1 performance or evaluation meetings
- Meetings on organizational changes
There are several benefits and reasons to sharing your calendar with everyone at GitLab:
- Transparency is one of our values and sharing what you work on is in line with our message of “be open about as many things as possible”.
- Due to our timezone differences, there are small windows of time when our availabilities overlap. If other members need to schedule a new meeting, seeing the details of recurring meetings (such as 1-1s) will allow for more flexibility in scheduling without needing to wait for a confirmation from the team member. This speaks to our value to be more efficient.
[Unsupported block type: image]
Google Calendar - make calendar available setting
If you add blocks of time spent on recurring tasks to your Google Calendar to remind yourself to do things (e.g. “Check Google Analytics”), consider marking yourself “Free” for those events so that coworkers know they may schedule a meeting during that time if they can’t find another convenient time.
### Google Calendar Appointment Scheduling
This feature allows you to create a link to an availability schedule that you can send to your customers or coworkers for them to schedule a call according to your availability.
This allows you to only show available spots while keeping your other calls private. This also avoids having to go back and forth between you and other person figuring out what day and time works best for both of you. Since this is a native Google Calendar functionality, there is no need to set up integrations with your calendar like other scheduling tools.
A member of our Customer Success team created a [demo video of how to use this feature](https://youtu.be/NqJu_tg4aLs).
## External communication
Key practices to consider during any meeting are listed below.
1. Video Calls - If this is your first time meeting a customer/prospect/partner/etc., turn on your camera when you login to Zoom. This will help to make the customer/prospect feel more comfortable as they are certain your undivided attention is geared towards them.
1. “No agenda, no attenda” - Always have an [agenda prepped and ready to go](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/live-doc-meetings/), with the exception of [coffee chats](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#coffee-chats). Share this with your audience. Make sure that everything on the agenda is accurate and ask if there’s anything missing that needs to be addressed during this call or for the future. When there is no agenda, it translates to you not caring. When sharing agendas with customers and partners it should be called “GitLab + Name Shared Collaboration & Agenda”, not “External Agenda” as that implies there is something the parties are not seeing.
1. 70/30 Rule - Ask open ended questions that leave the audience talking 70% of the time, while you are talking 30% of the time. Please note that this varies based on the type of meeting that you are conducting. Be conscious of what questions need to be asked and to capture those items.
1. Take Notes - Effective note-taking is a valuable skill that will help you retain and recall any important details. Be the person who remembers all the details of your audience’s needs.
1. Adapt to Audience Tone - Before going into the business portion of your meeting, evaluate first the tone of the audience. Adapt your tone accordingly in order to appeal to various types of personalities.
1. Mid-call - Half-way through the meeting, check in with your audience. Ask them what their thoughts are on the progression of this meeting and if what you’re presenting is on the right track. This helps both you and the audience by re-aligning expectations and making sure the meeting is going the right direction.
1. Pre-Close Summary - 10 Minutes (1-hour meetings) or 5 minutes (30 minute meetings) prior to ending the call, ask the audience to build out an agenda for the next step or meeting. This helps to secure next steps and to ensure there are no balls dropped.
1. Post Meeting Action - Immediately write down notes and next steps and input into the proper directory (Google Drive, Salesforce, etc.).
1. Two Block Rule - For in person meetings with external parties you should wait until you’re more than two blocks from the meeting before discussing the results of the meeting. Nobody wants to hear themselves being discussed in the bathroom.
### Communicating with media and industry analysts
GitLab team members are not authorized to speak with the media or analysts on behalf of our company unless authorized by our Marketing department. Unless authorized, do not give the impression that you are speaking on behalf of GitLab in any communication that may become public. This includes posts to online forums, social media sites, blogs, chat rooms, and bulletin boards. This policy also applies to comments to journalists about specific matters that relate to our businesses, as well as letters to the editor and endorsements of products or services.
For more, please visit the [Corporate Communications handbook section](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/corporate-communications/).
### Paid external speaking requests
GitLab as the leader in all remote work creates opportunities for our team members to receive requests from external 3rd parties to participate on panels, blogs or news publication or articles. Recently our team members have been approached by external 3rd parties looking to pay or compensate GitLab team members for their time to discuss GitLab remote practice to help them guide a client. Other third parties may contact GitLab team members to provide subject matter expertise that they may have by virtue of their role at GitLab. As in any request we ask that team members verify who they are speaking with to make sure the source is indeed a valid and legitimate request. Always remember that you represent GitLab and if any question makes you uncomfortable or gives you a pause on whether you should answer then we recommend that you do not answer. A third party’s questions regarding GitLab financials, sales, compliance, executives or specifically where the company is heading should be treated with the most caution. We want and encourage all team members to be remote evangelists and this can be done without giving very specific information about GitLab. If you have any concern about a request please reach out on slack to [#external-comms](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CB274TZRR)
### Social media
Please see our [team member social media policy](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/team-member-social-media-policy/).
### Posting or streaming to YouTube
See the [YouTube page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/youtube/) for options and instructions for posting recordings and live streaming to our YouTube channels.
### Guidelines for vendor meetings
1. We request external vendor meetings to use our video conferencing tool so we can quickly join the call and record the session if we need to. Confirm with vendor that they agree we can record the call. The DRI for the vendor meeting will generate the zoom link and share with the vendor.
1. Decide ahead of the meeting who should be invited, i.e. those likely to get the most out of it.
1. Ahead of the meeting, we should agree internal agenda items/requirements/priorities and provide to the external provider.
1. In order to make the best use of time, we wish to avoid team introductions on the call, particularly where there are a number of us attending. We can include a list of attendees with the agenda and give it to the vendor before or after the meeting. Introductions can be helpful in some external calls. In those meetings, use [these guidelines](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#meeting-introduction-guidelines).
1. When a question or issue is raised on the agenda, if the person who raised it is present they will verbalize it live on the call; or if they are not present, then someone will raise it for them. This is a common GitLab practice.
1. Where possible, we request that the vendor provides their slides / presentation materials and any other related information after the meeting.
1. Do not demo your tool live, create a pre-recorded walk-through of the tool and make it available to GitLab before the meeting so we can ask questions if needed.
1. Be cognizant of using inclusive language.
1. We respectfully request that everyone is mindful of the time available, to help manage the call objectives effectively.
### User communication guidelines
- Keep conversations positive, friendly, real, and productive while adding value.
- If you make a mistake, admit it. Be upfront and be quick with your correction. If you’re posting to a blog, you may choose to modify an earlier post. Just make it clear that you have done so.
- There can be a fine line between healthy debate and incendiary reaction. Try to frame what you write to invite differing points of view without inflaming others. You don’t need to respond to every criticism or barb. Be careful and considerate.
- [Assume positive intent](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#assume-positive-intent) and explicitly state the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says before you respond, not a weaker one that’s easier to criticize. [Rapoport’s Rules](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rapoport%27s_Rules) also implores you to list points of agreement and mention anything you learned.
- Answer questions, thank people even if it’s just a few words. Make it a two way conversation.
- Appreciate suggestions and feedback.
- Do not make promises that you can’t keep.
- Do not offer [platitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platitude). Be direct and respectful. For [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/105891) - we don’t need to suggest that our actions are because we “heard feedback” when they are really done for other reasons.
- Guide users who ask for help or give a suggestion and share links. [Improving Open Development for Everyone](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2015/12/16/improving-open-development-for-everyone/), [Types of requests](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2014/12/08/explaining-gitlab-bugs/).
- When facing negative comments, respond patiently and treat every user as an individual, people with the strongest opinions can turn into [the strongest supporters](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2015/05/20/gitlab-gitorious-free-software/).
- By default, discussions in issues and MRs are public and could include participation of wider community members. It is important to make the wider community members feel welcome participating in discussions and sharing their view. Wider community members also submit [MRs to help improve our website/handbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged&label_name%5B%5D=Community%20Contribution) and this is often their first contribution to GitLab. We want to make sure that we are responsive to their contributions and thank them for helping improve GitLab.
- Adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contribute/code-of-conduct/) in all communication. Similarly, expect users to adhere to the same code when communicating with the GitLab team and the rest of the GitLab community. No one should accept being mistreated.
### Company phone number
If you need to provide the details of GitLab’s contact information you can take the [address from the visiting page](https://about.gitlab.com/company/visiting/) for reference; or the [mailing address](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/#addresses) of the office in the Netherlands if that is more applicable.
If a phone number is required, leave this field empty by default. If that is not possible, then use the general number (+1-415-761-1791), but be aware that this number simply guides to a voice message that refers the caller back to contacting us via email.
## Effective communication competency
[Competencies](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/competencies/) are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn.
In an all-remote organization effective communication is key to exchanging knowledge, ideas, and information. Effective communication at GitLab:
- Uses [asynchronous](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/) communication as the starting point and stays as open and transparent as we can by [communicating via text](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#writing-style-guidelines) through public issues, merge requests, and Slack channels (over DMs).
- Places an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down ensuring a [single source of truth](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/documentation/styleguide/#documentation-is-the-single-source-of-truth-ssot).
- [Produces video](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/youtube/) when necessary.

- Recognises when synchronous communication is the more appropriate option.
- Directs all decisions and discussions to the Handbook as a single source of truth.
- Records videos to communicate information when that is the most efficient and effective way to consume the content.
- Employs multimodal communication to broadcast important decisions.
- Practices low context communication and provides as much background as possible when communicating via text to avoid confusion.
**Skills and behavior of applying effective communication as a People Manager**:
- Implements working asynchronously across teams, departments or across the company. Drives communication where possible to asynchronous channels.
- Holds team members accountable for effectively communicating via text.
- Fosters an environment across teams, departments or divisions where asynchronous communication is the starting point.
- Guides team members on when producing video is appropriate. Implements interactive communication tools across their team, department or the company depending on level.
- Drives and funnels conversations to the right channels across teams, divisions and the company.
