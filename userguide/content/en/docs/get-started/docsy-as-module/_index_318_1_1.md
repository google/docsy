title: "Architecture Design Documents"
no_list: true

Design documents are the primary artifact that the [architecture design workflow](../workflow/)
revolves around. A design document describes a technical vision and a set of principles
that will guide feature implementation, as we move forward. It acts as guardrails
to keep team aligned.

They are version controlled documents that are constantly updated with new insights and knowledge,
after every iteration, to become even more useful with time.
