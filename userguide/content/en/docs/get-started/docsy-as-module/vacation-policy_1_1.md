### Introduction

At Green Orbit Digital, we recognize the importance of work-life balance and the value of taking time off to rest, recharge, and spend quality time with loved ones. Our vacation policy is designed to support the well-being and productivity of our employees by providing them with ample opportunities to take time off for vacation.

### Eligibility
