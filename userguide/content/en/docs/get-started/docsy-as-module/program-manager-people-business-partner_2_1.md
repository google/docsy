title: People Business Partner Program Manager
---

The People Business Partner (PBP) Program Manager is an integral part of the PBP team. This function supports and drives program execution and project management across the People Business Partner group for programs where PBPs are DRIs or stakeholders and serves as a critical liaison cross-functionally within the People Group division, collaborating regularly across other departments in the function to drive program excellence.

This function has two core focus areas:

1. Cross-company Talent Programs where People Business Partners are either [DRIs](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) or stakeholders, including but not limited to: [Annual Compensation Review](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/), [360 Feedback](/handbook/people-group/360-feedback/), [Talent Assessment](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/), [Succession Planning](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#succession-planning), [Key Talent Program](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#key-talent-program), [Organizational Design](/handbook/people-group/organizational-design/), and our [Promotion Process](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/). Program Management scope will differ depending on whether PBP is the DRI or stakeholder for the program at hand.
    - For programs where PBPs are DRIs, the PBP Program Manager will be expected to manage end-to-end program management for the entire program. In the People Group when multiple Program Managers are involved, the Program Manager aligned to the team that is the program DRI assumes the responsibility of full program management.
    - For programs where PBPs are stakeholders (the majority of the aforementioned programs), the PBP Program Manager approaches the program as a partner from a PBP lens, collaborating closely with the DRI Program Manager. Approaching program management from a PBP lens includes: identifying timeline and actions for PBPs throughout the program, attending program meetings and ensuring the wider PBP team remains aware of program status, advocating for the PBP team and helping the wider project team understand conflicting priorities PBPs have to ensure ability to balance and deliver results, providing perspective and insight into how the program fits into the wider PBP role and talent strategy, partnering with the team in drafting communication back to business leaders, surfacing questions we anticipate from the business early on to get ahead of change management, and helping determine what PBP success looks like as stakeholders and contributors to the project.

1. Division-specific People projects that require program management partnership and support

In addition to Talent Program execution, this role focuses on providing structure, alignment, and insight within the PBP team. The function is uniquely positioned to drive impact across the organization through working closely with PBPs supporting leaders across the company and opportunity to delve deeper within specific divisions.
