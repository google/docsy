Teleport is an Access Management Platform allowing users to gain read or write access to various resources.

The [infrastructure runbook docs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/tree/master/docs/teleport) contain a variety of detailed topics on using and interacting with teleport.

Until CorpSec is staffed to provide technical ownership, [Foundations](../../../../engineering/infrastructure-platforms/production-engineering/foundations/_index.md) providing maintenance of the underlying infrastructure. All non-maintenance related feature requests and improvements are managed by CorpSec.
