## Tips to promote a healthy mindset

- Start small – Give yourself small achievable targets to get yourself back into the swing of things. Whether it be work, a workout or just a general errand. Phone a friend – Sometimes debriefing about your day is all you need to put you back into a positive mindset\

- Try something New/Fun – Give yourself a new burst of motivation by doing something you’ve never done before

- Keep a journal – Getting the thoughts that are bothering you down on a page can help to clear them from your mind. Also writing down the things that we are grateful for in a day is important to see that not the whole day has been a bad day.

- Exercise regularly – Exercise releases endorphins. Endorphins are naturally produced by your nervous system and helps your deal with pain and stress.

- Eat Healthy – Research supports a diet of highly processed foods, with little nutrients, play a significant impact on not only your body but also your mind. Good nutrition allows you to feel good from the inside out.|

- Reflect – Making time to reflect is a powerful thing. Take time to reflect on the past day or week and reflect on how you resolved problems and how it felt. Reflection is a great way to stay in tune with yourself, learn and maintain a fresh mind.
