When modifications are being made to any Licensing and Renewals workflows, consider the following:

- Will this change impact teams outside of Support?
- What is the urgency of this update?
- ??

## Notifications

- Regional DRIs to mention at the L&R sync session
- Add the announcement to [Support Week-In-Review (SWIR)](/handbook/support/#support-week-in-review)
- Schedule posts in [#support_licensing-subscription](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C018C623KBJ) Slack channel
in each region to notify changes the week of deployment (at least 72 hours prior)
- Schedule a general reminder on the day of deployment in [#support_team-chat](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CCBJYEWAW) and [#support_licensing-subscription](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C018C623KBJ)

### Internal Stakeholders

If this change will have an impact on how Field Team members collaborate with L&R
Support Team members, follow the steps outlined in the [Field Communications Playbook](/handbook/sales/field-communications/#field-communications-playbook)
to announce the change to the Field Team. Generally, a workflow-related update will qualify as a [Tier 2 update](/handbook/sales/field-communications/#tier-2-update).

L&R team members generally work with Sales and CSMs in the following Slack channels, so you might also
consider posting an update to these channels:

- [#support_to_sales_escalation](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C011JT165J5)
- [#csm-updates](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01QETPR7B6)
