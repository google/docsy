## Introduction

At Green Orbit Digital, our mission is to empower change through sustainability, innovation, and inclusivity. In that spirit, we acknowledge the importance of recognising and addressing unconscious bias — subtle yet powerful mental shortcuts that can impact how we work, collaborate, and build an inclusive culture.

Unconscious bias isn't a sign of bad intent. It’s a human trait developed through socialisation and lived experience. What matters is our willingness to explore, unlearn, and grow beyond those automatic patterns — making space for diverse perspectives and fairer practices.

## What is Unconscious Bias?

Unconscious (or implicit) bias refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. These biases are automatic, deeply ingrained, and often run counter to our conscious beliefs.

They’re shaped by our background, culture, personal experiences, media consumption, and social environments. While bias can sometimes act as a mental shortcut to aid decision-making, it can also result in unfair judgements, exclusion, and inequality — especially in the workplace.

At Green Orbit Digital, we believe that recognising and confronting our biases helps build a culture of empathy, creativity, and social responsibility — both internally and across our wider networks.

## How Can We Recognise It?

1. Cultivate Self-Awareness

- Reflect on your initial impressions — are they based on facts or assumptions?

- Monitor your internal dialogue and body language.

- Notice discomfort or quick judgements — they can be entry points for bias.

2. Embrace Curiosity and Active Listening

- Ask open-ended questions instead of assuming.

- Take time to understand perspectives different from your own.

- Listen for understanding, not just to respond.

3. Challenge Assumptions

- Avoid defaulting to “gut feelings” — slow down your decision-making process.

- Use structured criteria to guide actions and evaluations.

- Seek multiple viewpoints before making key decisions.

4. Welcome Feedback

- Create a feedback-positive environment.

- Invite honest feedback on your behaviour and biases.

- Reflect without defensiveness — learning is part of leadership.

5. Stay Accountable

- Revisit your actions, language, and decisions.

- Diversify your networks, reading lists, teams, and influences.

- Commit to continuous personal and collective growth.

## Common Types of Unconscious Bias

## How Can We Test Our Biases?

One of the most widely used tools for identifying unconscious bias is the Implicit Association Test (IAT), developed by researchers from Harvard, Virginia, and Washington universities. It assesses the strength of associations between concepts (e.g., race, gender) and evaluations (e.g., good, bad).

The IAT can help you reflect on:

- Where your biases come from

- How they may be shaping your behaviours

- How you can begin to interrupt them

## Tips for Recognising and Avoiding Bias

1. Accept that everyone has biases — it's part of being human.

1. Identify your personal biases through reflection or testing.

1. Intervene when you notice bias in yourself or others.

1. Be mindful of how bias influences hiring, reviews, and collaborations.

1. Stay informed — understand how stereotypes are created and maintained.

1. Seek diversity of thought when making decisions.

1. Consider cultural perspectives — especially in global partnerships.

1. Avoid over-relying on first impressions.

1. Use structured criteria to reduce bias in recruitment or evaluation processes.

## Managing Bias: The SPACE2 Model of Inclusion

Green Orbit Digital encourages using the SPACE2 Model — six evidence-based techniques to reduce bias:

- Slowing Down: Pause before you judge or act.

- Perspective Taking: Consider the world through another’s lens.

- Asking Yourself: “What assumptions am I making?”

- Cultural Intelligence: Appreciate and adapt to cultural differences.

- Exemplars: Seek out and amplify diverse role models.

- Expand: Broaden your circle and challenge comfort zones.

## Practical Actions in the Workplace

- During Recruitment: Use structured interview formats, anonymise CVs, involve diverse interviewers.

- In Project Planning: Test assumptions. Are you including all voices? Who might be excluded?

- For Performance Reviews: Use standardised criteria, and review your last few evaluations to check for inconsistencies or trends.

- Across Teams: Foster psychological safety so team members can speak up when bias is observed.

## Our Commitment

At Green Orbit Digital, we are committed to:

- Ongoing unconscious bias training and awareness for team members.

- Embedding inclusive practices in our hiring, project management, and leadership development.

- Creating space for open dialogue, feedback, and learning.

- Measuring and evolving our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts over time.

We believe that diversity fuels innovation, and inclusion ensures everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Confronting unconscious bias isn’t just a responsibility — it’s an opportunity to lead with integrity and empathy in everything we do.
