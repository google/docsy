We refer to "our services" throughout â€“ this means all services (including related websites) owned or operated by GitLab.

We reserve the right to take any action we feel is appropriate to enforce this policy. We may take action to prevent use of our services which goes against the spirit of this policy, even if that use is not expressly forbidden.

By using our services, you agree to abide by the latest version of this policy, which we may modify at any time.
