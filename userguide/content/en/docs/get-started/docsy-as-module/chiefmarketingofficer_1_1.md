# Chief Marketing Officer

GitLab CMO Handbook: Review requests and communication guidelines
Welcome to the GitLab CMO Handbook
This page details processes for the Chief Marketing Officer at GitLab, including review and approval requests, communication guidelines, and information-sharing best practices.
Learn more about GitLab’s Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer [Ashley Kramer](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/team/#akramer) in [her README](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/readmes/ashley-kramer/).
## Communication guidelines
In an effort to create more efficiency in how we collaborate, please utilize the [#cmo Slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C04C38T1KQV) for items that require CMO **review**, **feedback**, **approval**, to **share updates**, or if you have **questions** directly to the CMO.
*Note this is a public Slack channel, so please consider it is *[*SAFE*](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/)* before sharing.*
## Review and Approvals
Follow the steps and details for workflows that involve different types of review requests for efficient reviews.
- Join the [#cmo Slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C04C38T1KQV) to create a new review request 
- Ensure that direct reports to the CMO have reviewed and approved before asking the CMO to review 
- Please add [CMO’s EBA](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/eba/) as CC into the message and include a [due date](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#communicating-dates-and-time) until when the review is required. 
Example review request:
[Unsupported block type: code]
### Merge Requests
Before assigning the CMO for review and approval, please ensure that the following applies:
- The MR is mergeable: [All comment threads resolved](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#resolve-a-thread), [MR is marked as ready](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/drafts.html#mark-merge-requests-as-ready) and not a draft, and [CI/CD pipelines ran successfully](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/widgets.html#pipeline-information) and deployed the latest [review app](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/).
- Add [@akramer](https://gitlab.com/akramer) as a `Reviewer` to the MR. You can use `/assign_reviewer @akramer` as a [quick action](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html) in the comment (press `r` as keyboard shortcut)
- Optional: Share a Review App URL for direct access to relevant changes and pages, or add a screenshot/summary in the request for more efficient reviews.
Follow the best practices for merge request reviews in the [CEO handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/#communicating-merge-requests).
## Sharing content to read
If you have an interesting article or news item to read and learn, feel free to share it in the [#cmo Slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C04C38T1KQV) too.
- Add `FYI,` without @-tagging the CMO in the beginning of the Slack message. This avoids notification distractions and enables async reading.
- Create a summary of 1-3 sentences with key talking points and take aways.
- Add screenshots, or source URLs for better context
- Optional: `Suggested actions:` that suggest a follow-up task for the CMO.
