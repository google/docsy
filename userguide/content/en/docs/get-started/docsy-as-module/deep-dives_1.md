The groups in the [Create stage](/handbook/product/categories/#create-stage) organize regular [Deep Dive sessions](/handbook/communication/deep-dives/)
to share our domain specific knowledge with others in the stage, the organization,
and the wider community. All existing Deep Dives can be found on [GitLab Unfiltered](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KqsiWzD0YZYp9xSxgTRoWxH)
with slides and recordings in the descriptions. For Create specific Deep Dives, there is a
[different playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFGfElNsQthYqXzKeq9l-ujLiChPAZag4). To find more information on upcoming sessions,
or to propose a new topic, please see the [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2410).
