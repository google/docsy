ESG Policy - October 2023

Introduction
At Green Orbit Digital, we are a sustainability-driven marketing agency, dedicated to providing eco-conscious marketing solutions for the space industry. Our commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles is at the core of our operations. This ESG Policy outlines our aproach to integrating these principles into our company's culture, activities, and client services.

Our Commitment
We are dedicated to operating responsibly and contributing to a sustainable future for our planet. Our marketing services are designed to promote responsible space initiatives while delivering value to our clients.

Environmental Stewardship
We understand the importance of protecting the environment. Our marketing strategies aim to promote sustainable practices within the space industry and contribute positively to environmental goals. We align our services with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to the environment.

Social Responsibility
We recognise our social responsibilities and the role our marketing plays in shaping societal values. Our services prioritise diversity, inclusion, and ethical practices. We are committed to fostering an inclusive work culture and respecting human rights.

Governance and Ethics
Ethics and governance are fundamental to our operations. We maintain transparency and ethical practices in all our activities. We strive to uphold governance standards and adhere to industry regulations.

ESG Integration
Green Orbit Digital actively integrates ESG principles into our marketing services. We assess our clients' objectives, ensuring alignment with the SDGs, and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. Our approach includes:

Evaluating Clients' ESG Alignment
Before entering into any marketing partnership, we assess potential clients to ensure their business values align with our ESG principles. We do not engage with companies associated with controversial practices or those that violate human rights.

ESG Due Diligence
Our marketing campaigns undergo rigorous ESG due diligence, conducted in parallel with commercial assessments. This evaluation helps us identify and manage ESG risks in our marketing strategies, ensuring they align with the sustainability goals of our clients.

Stakeholder Engagement
We engage with clients, employees, and partners to promote a culture of responsibility, emphasising the ESG impact of our marketing campaigns. We value stakeholder feedback, which informs our ESG strategy.

Policy Implementation and Review
This policy is effective as of October 2023 and will be reviewed annually to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness in guiding our commitment to ESG principles.

Green Orbit Digital is committed to responsible marketing practices in the space industry. Our ESG Policy reflects our dedication to integrating sustainability and ethical values into every facet of our company, from our internal culture to the marketing solutions we provide to our clients. We believe that aligning our marketing efforts with ESG principles enables us to make a positive impact on both the industry and our planet.
