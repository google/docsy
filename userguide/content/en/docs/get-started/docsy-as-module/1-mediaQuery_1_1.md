### media query
Websites are often displayed on screens but CSS can also be used to style websites for other outputs too. You might want your web pages to look one way on a screen but different when printed out. Querying media types makes this possible.

In this example, the background color is set to grey. But if the page is printed, the background color should be transparent. This saves the user's printer ink.

```css
body {
  color: black;
  background-color: grey;
}

@media print {
  body {
    background-color: transparent;
  }
}
```
you can make a separate stylesheet and use the media attribute on a link element:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" media="print">
```
If you don't specify any media type for your CSS, it will automatically have a media type value of all. These two blocks of CSS are equivalent:
```css
body {
  color: black;
  background-color: white;
}
@media all {
   body {
     color: black;
     background-color: white;
   }
}
```
These two lines of HTML are also equivalent:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="global.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="global.css" media="all">
```

### practical
to apply styles when the browser window is wider than a certain width, use min-width.
```css
@media (min-width: 400px) {
  // Styles for viewports wider than 400 pixels.
}
```
Use the max-width media feature to apply styles below a certain width:
```css
@media (max-width: 400px) {
  // Styles for viewports narrower than 400 pixels.
}
```
combination using `and` keyword
```css
@media (min-width: 50em) and (max-width: 60em) {
  // Styles for viewports wider than 50em and narrower than 60em.
}
```
You can use lots of different CSS units in your media queries. If your content is mostly image-based, pixels might make the most sense. If your content is mostly text-based, it probably makes more sense to use a unit thatâ€™s based on text size, like `rem` or `em`

The point at which a media feature condition becomes true is called a breakpoint. It's best to choose your breakpoints based on your content rather than popular device sizes, as those are subject to change with every technology release cycle

You can use media queries based on the height of the viewport, not just the width. This could be useful for optimizing interface content "above the fold"

```css
@media (min-width: 50em) and (min-height: 60em) {
  article {
    column-count: 2;
  }
}
```

If you write CSS, you may have used **directional properties** like "left", "right", "top", and "bottom." Those keywords refer to the physical layout of the user's device.
