### My Role and Responsibilities

**As your manager, I will do all I can to make it possible for you to succeed professionally. That means I will strive to do at least the following...**

- Provide you with the tools to do your job
- Coach and mentor you in career development
- Bring you information from the rest of GitLab
- Shield you from outside pressures
- Set clear expectations for you & give clear feedback
- Be available for you to lean on me
- Give you many opportunities to stand on your own two feet

### I Expect

- **honesty, integrity and professionalism**
- that you share and will act in accordance with [GitLab's Values](/handbook/values/)
- understanding of GitLab's business and goals

- **in time off**

### Working with Me

- Need something from me? No need to schedule a meeting in advance. Just contact me on Slack or send me an email.
- I appreciate when people get to the point quickly instead of working around to it slowly. It's not that I'm in a hurry; I just like to get to the heart of the matter.
- Similarly, I tend to be pretty direct and straightforward. If it's too much for you, please just let me know and I'll do my best to adjust.
- I seek only useful, beneficial change - pretty much never change for the sake of change.
- I want to be the most helpful, useful, supportive manager I can be for each person on my team. So please tell me:
  - what I'm doing well, and should therefore keep doing
  - what I can do better
  - what I should start doing
  - what I should stop doing
- I try very hard to write or say exactly what I mean, with no hidden agenda or secrets. If there's information you want but that I can't give you, I'll let you know. But I won't make stuff up, and I won't make you guess. So you shouldn't need to read between the lines.
