## Promotional Games

### Engaging legal for approval

From time to time, GitLab sponsors promotional games. While these seem simple enough and may be an effective marketing tactic, there are quite a few factors for Legal to consider when planning such an event. Because of this, requests for Official Rules should be submitted at least 2 weeks prior to the date you need a decision.

If you are planning a promotional game, you will need legal approval for the proposed promotional game. Please use the Promotional Games Legal Template housed in the Marketing Ops repo.

The following explanations will help you fill out the template completely. This is essential, as all of the questions were developed based on legal requirements. Issues that do not answer all the questions will not be approved and the due date may be impacted.

Once your issue description is completely filled out, Legal will review all the details in light of the applicable laws and make recommendations to tailor the promotional game. Legal will also provide the Official Rules and the Abbreviated Rules. Depending on the locale, you may be required to obtain a translation of the rules to local languages. Legal does not provide this, so you will need to ensure that you have the ability to procure this through Marketing vendors. Some rules can be translated through automated services, but others may require human translation depending on the prize amounts and jurisdiction.

### Hosting the Promotional Game Rules

Any promotional game sponsored by GitLab must be accompanied by Official Rules. Once legal has drafted and provided these to you, you will need to create a new page under the GitLab Sweepstakes page and add a link to the list of Current promotional games. Once you have added the rules for your promotional game, link to these from the landing page of your entry form or promotion.

Abbreviated Rules, with a link to the full Official Rules, must be present wherever there’s a mention of the promotion or prizes. Abbreviated Rules will be provided by legal.

Note: Remember to move your page from the Current to the Past lists once your promotional game is complete.

Official Rules for internal GitLab team member only sweepstakes, contests and giveaways, should be placed on the Legal - Internal Sweepstakes, Contests and Giveaways page of the internal handbook. Instructions for uploading Official Rules for internal promotions can be found there.

## Publicity Waiver and Release

For requests related to the use of an individual’s image or voice in print or digital media, for team members and non-team members, refer to the Publicity Waiver and Release Guidelines and Process.
