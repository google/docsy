### How to Write Your Personal “How to Work with Me” Manual
This guide will help you create your own manual to communicate how you work best. The key is to provide clear insights into your preferences and habits, allowing team members to collaborate more effectively with you. 
### Step 1: Know Thyself
Take some time to reflect on how you operate within a team. Ask yourself the following:
- **Communication Preferences**:   - Do you prefer to start conversations with small talk or go straight to the point?  - Do you like informal communication (e.g., emojis, gifs), or do you prefer keeping it formal?  - What channels work best for you (email, chat, calls)?  - **Work Style**:   - How do you make decisions? Do you need time to think things through, or do you prefer quick decisions?  - What does great work look like to you? Do you thrive in structured environments or more creative, free-flowing ones?  - **Feedback**:   - How do you want to receive feedback (direct, with suggestions, in person, in writing)?  - How often would you like feedback (after tasks, during projects, only in reviews)?  - **Blind Spots**:   - What things do you tend to miss or overlook? Are there tasks or behaviours your team should help remind you about?
- **Strengths**:   - What are you great at? Where do you add the most value to the team?
### Step 2: Explain Your Perspective
The next step is explaining why you work the way you do. Understanding how your preferences impact your work helps the team align better.
- **Examples**:   - "I like to get straight to the point because I believe it saves time and helps with efficiency."  - "I enjoy using emojis in chat because they help me express tone and emotion."
- **Be Honest**:   - "I might get frustrated with long meetings without clear outcomes."  - "I tend to over-apologise, but I don’t need reassurance when I do."
- **Explain Your Strengths**:   - "I thrive when tackling big-picture challenges and enjoy thinking long-term."  - "I love detail-oriented work and tend to spot errors others might miss."
### Step 3: Organise for Clarity
When writing your manual, group your thoughts into key sections:
1. **Introduction**: Start with a quick summary of who you are and how you like to work.   - Example: “Hi, I’m [Your Name]. I prefer direct communication and structured tasks, but I’m also flexible and happy to brainstorm when needed.”
2. **Communication**: Outline how you prefer to interact.   - Example: “I like to use email for detailed conversations and chat for quick updates. I respond best to messages in the morning and prefer not to have meetings after 3pm.”
3. **Feedback**: Let others know how you’d like to hear from them.   - Example: “Please be clear and constructive in your feedback. I appreciate knowing both what I did well and what could be improved.”
4. **Decision-Making**: Explain how you approach decisions.   - Example: “I make decisions based on data, but I also value intuition. I like to think things through, so I don’t rush decisions without reviewing all the information.”
5. **Strengths & Weaknesses**: Be open about your skills and areas where you need support.   - Example: “I’m great at keeping projects organised and running smoothly, but I sometimes miss smaller details. Feel free to point out anything I might have overlooked.”
### Step 4: If You’re a Manager
If you’re a manager, be sure to answer these specific questions:
- **Task Involvement**: What level of involvement do you want in team tasks?  - “I want to be looped in for major decisions, but I trust my team to handle day-to-day operations.”
- **Communication Frequency**: How often do you want updates?  - “I prefer weekly updates, but I don’t need to be contacted unless there’s an urgent issue.”
- **Decision-Making**: How should your team handle decision-making?  - “You can make most decisions independently, but for anything that impacts the larger project, check in with me first.”


### Example “How to Work with Me” Manual
**Introduction**Hi, I’m [Your Name]. I work best when there’s a balance between structure and flexibility. I enjoy collaborating with teams, but I also like having time to focus on individual tasks.
**Communication**- Please feel free to message me via chat for quick questions. For more detailed discussions, email is best.- I prefer direct communication, but I appreciate politeness.- I’m fine with emojis in informal chats, but I keep emails more formal.
**Feedback**- I value honest, constructive feedback. Please tell me what I can improve, but also let me know what I did well!- I prefer written feedback after a task is completed.
**Decision-Making**- I like to weigh pros and cons before making decisions. I’m methodical but open to quick calls if needed.
**Strengths & Weaknesses**- I’m great at planning and organising, but I can sometimes overlook small details. If something seems off, please let me know.- I love tackling complex problems and brainstorming creative solutions.
**As a Manager**- I want to be involved in major project decisions, but I trust the team to handle day-to-day operations.- If there’s an issue, I expect to hear from you sooner rather than later, but I don’t need constant updates.
