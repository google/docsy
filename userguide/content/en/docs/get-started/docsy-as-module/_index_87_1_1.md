## Zendesk view

A zendesk view was created to see all Authentication and Authorization tickets. To have access to the view, in the [Support Team data](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-support-readiness/support-team/-/tree/master/data/agents?ref_type=heads), add `- 'Support Focus: Authentication and Authorization` under `zendesk:` section.

For example

```yaml
 zendesk:
    main:
      id: xxxxxxxxxx
      groups:
      - 'Support Focus: Authentication and Authorization'
```
