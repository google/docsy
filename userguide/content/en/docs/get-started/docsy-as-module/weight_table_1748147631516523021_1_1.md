| Weight | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| 0: Very Trivial | Reserved for tasks that are very straightforward and ideally will not take more than an hour. For such tasks, it is not worth counting their weight for capacity planning.<br><br>Examples include flipping feature flags on GitLab.com, creating an MR to flip feature flags for self-managed, or issues slipped from the previous milestone that are in final review stages and aren't expected to require more work. |
| 1: Trivial | The problem is very well understood, no extra investigation is required, the exact solution is already known and just needs to be implemented, no surprises are expected, and no coordination with other teams or people is required.<br><br>Examples are documentation updates, simple regressions, and other bugs that have already been investigated and discussed and can be fixed with a few lines of code, or technical debt that we know exactly how to address, but just haven't found time for yet. |
| 2: Small | The problem is well understood and a solution is outlined, but a little bit of extra investigation will probably still be required to realize the solution. Few surprises are expected, if any, and no coordination with other teams or people is required.<br><br>Examples are simple features, like a new API endpoint to expose existing data or functionality, or regular bugs or performance issues where some investigation has already taken place. |
| 3: Medium | Features that are well understood and relatively straightforward. A solution will be outlined, and most edge cases will be considered, but some extra investigation will be required to realize the solution. Some surprises are expected, and coordination with other teams or people may be required.<br><br>Bugs that are relatively poorly understood and may not yet have a suggested solution. Significant investigation will definitely be required, but the expectation is that once the problem is found, a solution should be relatively straightforward.<br><br>Examples are regular features, potentially with a backend and frontend component, or most bugs or performance issues. |
| 4: Large | Features that are well understood, but known to be hard. A solution will be outlined, and major edge cases will be considered, but extra investigation will definitely be required to realize the solution. Many surprises are expected, and coordination with other teams or people is likely required.<br><br>Bugs that are very poorly understood, and will not have a suggested solution. Significant investigation will be required, and once the problem is found, a solution may not be straightforward.<br><br>Examples are large features with a backend and frontend component, or bugs or performance issues that have seen some initial investigation but have not yet been reproduced or otherwise "figured out". |
| 5: Unknown | A feature that is weight 5 will not be scheduled and instead should be broken down or a spike scheduled |
