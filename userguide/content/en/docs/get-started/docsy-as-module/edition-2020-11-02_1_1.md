### Did You Know? üî¢

**On 2020-11-01, GitLab released the first MVC of allowing users to purchase additional storage**. When additional storage is purchased and applied to a GitLab.com namespace, the system will automatically apply the storage to blocked project and open them for use. Additional unused storage will remain available for use dynamically as projects near the 10GB limit. The Fulfillment team is still working on customer-facing docs, but you can [get a sense for how it works on the subscription FAQs page](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/licensing-faq/#can-i-buy-more-storage).

The CS team is **deprecating the old CSM customer tracking process and incorporating Stage Technology Tracking into Gainsight** with a bi-directional sync. This will help closer align the Sales and CS orgs and make the customer tracking process more collaborative for CSMs, SAs, and SAEs/AEs.

[Check out this video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OBFEHs4D_8&feature=youtu.be) for more information and reach out to #sales-support with any questions.

In an effort to increase customer satisfaction and speed time to adoption, the **Professional Services Education team recently redesigned the [GitLab System Administration course](https://about.gitlab.com/services/education/admin/)**. Here are the main changes:

1. **New Ordering Process - Admin Training Only:** Use the custom SOW process rather than the standard SKU process to ensure alignment with your customer's specific deployment.
1. **New Flexible Format:** Pick from a list of common deployment variables to quickly build a customized topic list for a basic administration training SOW.
1. **New "Advanced" Option:** Add on the [new advanced administration course](https://about.gitlab.com/services/education/admin/) dedicated to monitoring and de-bugging, for customers with Tier 2 admin team members.

---
Marketing has created **[two new target lists for both Large and Mid Market accounts](/handbook/marketing/account-based-marketing/) - GL4300 and MM4000 - that DemandGen, Field Marketing and Account Based Marketing will align efforts around**. The account lists are identified in Salesforce by the `GTM strategy Field` = `Account Centric` and `Account Based- Net New` tags. Both lists will be refreshed at the end of each quarter with the updated target account list available on day 1 of the new quarter.

Please [see this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/account-based-marketing/-/issues/308) for more information on the GL4300 and MM4000 lists and [add any questions to the Internal FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MK7imzvvcYBgylXzlyIFV5soE4qTJBG6tHLc2HT_DjI/edit?usp=sharing) doc that is updated daily.

### What's New in GitLab üöÄ

The GitLab 13.5 release is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:

- **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk:** Teams can take advantage of a valuable security testing solution for mobile apps with our new Mobile SAST language coverage, combined with our existing fuzz testing for Swift and Java projects. **This feature was contributed by GitLab customer H-E-B** that saw the need for Mobile Application Security Scanning and brought MobSF into the merge request pipeline to deliver this new capability.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** 13.5 offers a few more ways to help groups collaborate. This includes the launch of Group Wikis ‚Äì our most sought-after feature with the most upvotes ever ‚Äì which offer a central point of collaboration at the group level with a deep-level wiki navigation side bar for ease of use. This also includes a new timeline view for discussions in incidents, which provides clarity around the sequence of events in threaded discussions, as well as the Generic Package Registry, which enables release and build teams to effectively work in GitLab no matter what type of binary they are building in CI/CD.
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** The ability to create Snippets with multiple files allows teams to create and share complex Snippets. Furthermore, new templates, including a template for deploying to AWS EC2, a new GitLab CI/CD template for Terraform, and the new SAST configuration UI that enables the GitLab CI/CD SAST template for users without CI/CD experience, promotes best practices and consistency across teams.

### Team Member Spotlight üî¶

#### [Rob Nalen ‚Äì Director, Contracts & Legal Operations](https://gitlab.com/rnalen)

![Rob-Nalen-TMS-Thumb](/handbook/sales/field-communications/field-flash-newsletter/images/Rob_Nalen_Thumb.png)

**Where did you grow up, and where are you based now?**

I grew up in Upstate New York (Syracuse area) and have been in the Raleigh area since 2008.

**What is your favorite thing about your job?**

First, my team. I am so happy to have such a great group of people that I work with, whether it's the Contract Managers, or other Legal folks. Second is the opportunity to be creative. GitLab is my second start-up and I really enjoy building things and discovering how to address problems in new ways.

**Which of GitLab's Values resonates most with you?**

Results. Building a team and being a part of the sales / revenue side of GitLab, it is extremely important to focus on Results.

**Do you have a helpful tip for working at GitLab to share?**

As with any start-up, learn to be flexible. G&A groups are trying their best to address a growing team, new regulations & responsibilities, and scaling the company to meet the demands that our sellers bring.

**What is a hobby or skill you have that the team might not know about?**

I was a collegiate hockey goalie and I still play to this day.

**Icebreaker: What‚Äôs the craziest fashion trend you ever rocked?**

At my first start-up I made a bet with the Sales organization to help them motivate the team... I lost and a handlebar mustache was earned.
