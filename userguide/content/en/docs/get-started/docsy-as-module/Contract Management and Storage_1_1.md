# Contract Management and Storage

[Unsupported block type: image]
These instructions provide a step-by-step guide for GitLab Team Members on properly filing fully executed contracts and vendor-related documents in our designated storage systems.
## Execution & Storage
The GitLab Procurement team manages the execution and archiving of all vendor contracts in Zip under the appropriate vendor account for comprehensive tracking and accessibility. For inquiries regarding specific agreements, please tag the relevant Procurement team member in your existing request. Detailed information regarding the full vendor contract review and approval process can be found on the [Procurement Handbook Page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/).
## Legacy Repository
Please note that some vendor agreements executed prior to 2023 may be stored in our legacy repository, ContractWorks. Users with ContractWorks access can search for these documents within ContractWorks by the vendor name. If you require access to historical contracts but donâ€™t have ContractWorks credentials, please contact the GitLab Procurement team for assistance in retrieving these documents.
