### Giving / receiving feedback

It can be hard to understand how you're doing in your role, because feedback can come off as formal (annual reviews, 360 surveys, career development conversations, goal check-ins) or casual (in Slack channels, 1-1's, MR reviews, team meetings.) We receive various kinds of feedback regularly and through different formats, so the type of feedback you're receiving is not always clear. In order to be more intentional about the types of feedback given, here is a classification chart based on [three types of feedback](https://forimpact.org/three-types-feedback/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFeedback%20comes%20in%20three%20forms,about%20relationship%20and%20human%20connection.):

| Label | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **(appreciation)** | I want to thank you for doing this, and please do more of it in the future | "I did not expect that you would have created a working group, because you've done so, our whole team will benefit from the results." |
| **(coaching)** | I'm trying to help you improve a behavior you are already exhibiting or change a behavior that you currently have | "The reports that you give me are very helpful, and in the future we can schedule them for the first of the month to be more consistent." |
| **(evaluation)** | Tells you where you stand according to existing standards or expectations | "My expectation was that our decision would be transparent. Since it was not, our team has forgotten the decision, so we must be sure and meet that expectation next time." |
