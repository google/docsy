## What is fundamental for a successful inclusive environment

We are **all responsible** for creating and maintaining an inclusive environment at GitLab.

We all need to feel **empowered** to contribute and collaborate.

## Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging at GitLab

Diversity includes all the differences we each have, whether it be where we grew up, where we went to school, experiences, how we react, age, race, gender, national origin, things we can and can not see, the list goes on.

Inclusion is understanding or recognizing all these differences and inviting someone to be a part of things and collaborate, etc.

Belonging is when you feel your insights and contributions are valued. It goes back to team members feeling they can bring their full selves to work.

See the [Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging page]({{< ref "inclusion" >}}) page for more information.

## What inclusive behaviors look like

1. Include and seek input from team members across a wide variety of backgrounds.
1. Active listening - listen carefully to the person speaking and playback what they have said in an effort to show understanding.
1. Make a habit of asking questions.
1. If you have a strong reaction to someone, ask yourself why. Look inward.
1. Address misunderstandings and quickly resolve disagreements.
1. Make a point to understand each team member's contribution efforts and leverage them as much as possible.
1. Ensure all voices are heard. Include everyone as much as possible in discussions.
1. Assume positive intent and examine your assumptions/judgements.
