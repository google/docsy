### Introduction

At Green Orbit Digital, we value attendance and punctuality as essential components of a productive and cohesive work environment. Our Attendance Management Policy outlines our expectations regarding attendance, tardiness, and leave procedures to ensure the smooth operation of our business and the fair treatment of all employees.

1. Punctuality: Employees are expected to arrive at work and return from breaks and lunch within the designated times outlined in their work schedules. Habitual tardiness or unauthorized absences may result in disciplinary action.
