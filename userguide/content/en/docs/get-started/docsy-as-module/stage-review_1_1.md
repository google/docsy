The Engineering Stage Review is a monthly Engineering Manager meeting designed to evaluate team productivity, technical progress, and key metrics across the stage groups. In this meeting, we assess team productivity metrics and trends at a stage-wide level, review technical roadmap progress and align initiatives across teams, identify areas for improvement and discuss action plans, and connect related technical work across different teams.

**Format:**
- 50-minute monthly sessions, split into two parts:
	- Data Science Session (covering AI Framework, Custom Models, MLOps, Duo Chat)
	- AI Powered & Foundations Session (covering Duo Workflow, Global Search, Design System, Personal Productivity, Import & Integrate)
- Each team has approximately 10 minutes for review
- Metrics and updates are submitted 24 hours before the meeting for async review
