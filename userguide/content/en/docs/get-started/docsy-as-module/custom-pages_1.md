### How to Edit/Create pages using "Custom Pages"

To configure the page's routing, it is essential to declare the `slug` field. The page routes can extend up to three levels, for example, `/level-1/level-2/level-3/`.
It is crucial to include both a trailing slash and a leading slash to ensure proper functionality within Buyer Experience.

#### Hero Configuration

To personalize the hero section, use the fields in the [üõ†Ô∏è Custom Page](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/xz1dnu24egyd/environments/master/content_types/customPage/fields) Content Type.
