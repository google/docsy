## Overview

This Earth Month, GitLab is advancing our climate action program through an inaugural campaign designed to engage team members in sustainability initiatives. As a key pillar of [GitLab's climate action plan](/handbook/legal/esg/#climate-action), team member sustainability is increasingly important to our stakeholders and customers.

We're excited to announce our new partnership with [Mammoth Climate](https://www.mammothclimate.io/en), a climate literacy and challenges platform available to all full-time team members starting 2025-04-01. We also invite you to join our GiveLab virtual volunteer opportunity supporting Citizens of the Reef, where you can directly contribute to marine conservation efforts utilizing AI while connecting with fellow team members.

## The Impact of Our Participation In Earth Month

- **Customer Impact**: Sustainability has become a priority in vendor selection processes. GitLab received 120+ sustainability-related RFPs and questionnaires from customers and prospective customers in FY25. Understanding our sustainability programs enables team members to better serve customers with their growing sustainability expectations.

- **Innovation Opportunity**: Climate education can spark new ideas for sustainability features within GitLab's product and operations, supporting our goal of customer-focused innovation.

- **Team Member Engagement**: Studies show that sustainability programs boost team member morale and engagement. "Green perks" are emerging as an effective way to attract and retain environmentally conscious talent while fostering cross-functional collaboration.

### Volunteer with GiveLab

GitLab encourages team members to take part in volunteer initiatives such as supporting their local communities, participating in virtual volunteer activities, and organizing volunteer activities as part of team events. Corporate volunteerism has been proven to be an effective strategy for [boosting engagement](https://bc-ccc.uberflip.com/i/1510320-community-involvement-study-2023-executive-summary/0?_gl=1%2An3v02c%2A_ga%2ANzYwODcyNTg5LjE3Mjc3MTEzNzY.%2A_ga_50520H9ZLC%2AMTcyOTA1NTM1MC4yLjEuMTcyOTA1NTQyNS4wLjAuMA..), improving employee retention, and [strengthening relationships at work](https://blog.catchafire.org/5-corporate-volunteering-stats-you-should-know#:~:text=Studies%20show%20that%2080%25%20of,enhances%20the%20overall%20work%20culture). Volunteering with GiveLab supports team members in fostering connections, building trust among one another and embodying our CREDIT values while positively impacting our communities.

**Virtual Volunteering**

Celebrate Earth Month by [joining our 1-hour virtual event](https://forms.gle/A6jzg87yA3mnLyzdA) in support of [Citizens of the Reef](https://citizensgbr.org/) on 2025-04-09. This Australian organization combines people-power, AI, and science to protect marine ecosystems around the world threatened by climate change. Volunteers will analyze underwater photographs to identify priority coral reefs for conservation efforts. No experience required; event hosted by Goodera, a GitLab volunteer partner.

**Local Volunteering**

Connect with local team members by signing up for an environmental [volunteer event in your area](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TrOD4zIW83Vi3fKRFIgmJHKHcB4qIl6hniAcHbxNfQ4/edit?usp=sharing), and share the opportunity in your local Slack channel to organize a group outing.

This is a fun opportunity to spend the day outside while making a positive impact on the planet and building relationships with team members.

Team members who volunteer are eligible to expense local travel (mileage, train, taxi/rideshare), parking for the event, and meals during the event (up to $25 limit). All expenses must comply with [GitLab's Travel & Expense Policy](/handbook/finance/expenses/#1-policy).

## About GitLab Climate Action

GitLab is committed to doing our part to minimize our environmental footprint, including working to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with our operations. GitLab's stakeholders, including customers, investors, regulators, and team members expect the company to operate sustainably and to do our part to reduce our environmental footprint.

Many of GitLab's customers have GHG reduction targets and as a vendor, GitLab's carbon emissions contribute to our customers' emissions footprints. To remain easy to transact with, GitLab needs to meet the expectations of our customers by taking action on climate change.
