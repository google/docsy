## What is the Zendesk satisfaction survey?

As per [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408886194202-Customizing-your-customer-satisfaction-survey)

> One of Zendesk Support's most popular features is our built-in customer satisfaction survey. Customer satisfaction allows you to track how well your agents and customer service organization as a whole are performing on a ticket by ticket basis. Because of our simplified approach, on average our customers see a roughly 21% response rate - which is fantastic! Zendesk Support provides some great defaults for the survey, but we get a lot of questions about how to further customize the customer satisfaction experience.

We shorthand the overall setup (survey and ticket ratings) as SSAT
