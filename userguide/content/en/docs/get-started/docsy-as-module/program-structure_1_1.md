### Virtual Showcase

#### What will be presented in the Showcase?

At the end of the program, the Mentor / Mentee pair will [present](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kottit7eEl2iDf9zC5fHvTsgPQSHZ_VUyik5tB14kFc/edit?usp=sharing)  an overview of their Independent Project. Some examples of Independent Projects by mentees include:

- Leading a presentation
- Exhibiting commitment to a GitLab value by a specific action
- Developing a plan or project
- Contribution of improvements to a particular area of project
- Participation in a GitLab Working Group

There will be two Virtual Showcases to accommodate the various timezones. The Showcase will be held at the end of the mentoring program. All program participants will be required to attend the showcase.

### Post Program Evaluation

#### Mentee Survey

This survey would be given to Mentees and Mentors to:

- Measure their experience in the program
- Solicit suggestions for improvements
- Highlight aspects of the program that stood out in a positive manner
- Ask if they would recommend the program to their peers

#### Mentee / Mentor Supervisor Survey

- Measure participant behavior during the program
- Measure whether the Mentor and/or Mentee have begun to illustrate new behaviors following the experience

### Recognition

Mentor / Mentees should be recognized for their participation. Here are a some possible ways participants would be recognized for their work in the MIT Mentoring Program:

- Slack channel announcements
- Company announcements
- Diversity value consideration during annual reviews
- Being interviewed for a GitLab blog post or video
