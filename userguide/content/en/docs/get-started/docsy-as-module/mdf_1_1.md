### MDF Approval

- You will be notified via email.
- You must get formal approval before proceeding with your activity.

### Timeframe for Completing Activity

You may be able to reallocate your funds to another activity that is equal to or less than the original approved activity that takes place within the same time frame, but this must be approved by your Channel Marketing Manager.

### Receiving leads post MDF activity

This list is considered confidential and the property of both GitLab and the authorized GitLab partner, and will be used for the sole purpose of tracking lead progress and calculating the activities return on investment. By submitting your MDF request, you agree to these terms and conditions.

Upon your submission of the lead list, GitLab will pass those leads back to you directly within the GitLab Partner portal, making it seamless to connect your deals you'd like to deal reg back to the MDF request.

### GitLab's internal MDF Process Workflow

#### Phase 1: Pre-planning

- Budget is established by the year, allocated by each quarter, then region, and should be planned in a 6 month cycle.
- Channel Marketing Managers work on creating a strategic marketing plan on a 6 month rolling calendar.
- Internal approvals are needed. Plans are reviewed by Channel Marketing Manager's Team Managers and MDF Program Owner.
- If an MDF activity requires a contract signed or has a specific contract for that particular event, such as sponsorships or conferences, contracts need to be **reviewed and approved by Legal** before the approval is communicated to the Partner.
  - In this case, CMMs are to submit contract to the MDF Program Owner and they will open a Zip request to get approval done.
- Once internal approvals have been completed, CMMs communicate to Partners activities that are approved.
- If the MDF activity is a sponsorship and it does not have a specific contract from the partner legal will create one once communcated to them within the Zip approval process. This will then follow the same legal process as listed above.
- Partners are responsible for submitting an MDF request through the Partner Portal.

#### Phase 2: Processing MDF

- When a MDF fund request is received, MDF Program Owner and the Channel Marketing Manager receive an email alert.
- The Channel Marketing Managers have the ability to approve first, by confirming that all of the information input by the Partner was correct.
- Once they approve, the MDF Program Owner will do a final approval, also known as a level 2 approval.
- MDF Program Owner will link the fund request to the regional issues, mentioning its fund request number.
- At this point, all the MDFs that were approved and are ready to be processed.

- Processing an MDF consists of:
- Adding the MDF line in Allocadia, with all of its information.
*We don’t add this in the pre-planning phase because sometimes fund requests may get canceled or the Marketing Activity/event moves to a different date.*
- From Allocadia we open an MDF Epic and two sub-issues List Upload and POP (Proof of Performance).
- Marketo and Salesforce Campaign are created.

- POP Tracking board:
To better track the POP we have created a [MDF Operations Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/partner-marketing/-/boards/5415585?label_name[]=MDF-POP).
- POP Label description can be found [in this section](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#requesting-mdf-funds) of the handbook.
- Channel Marketing Managers are also tagged to create their own activity tracking issue.
- A Zip requisition request is opened.
- Zip will now have an MDF approver (MDF Program Owner) to make sure we have all of the correct information updated and to make sure that payment is not process for partner before receiving the POP.
- After that Zip approval will take 4 business days.

#### Phase 3: Payment

- Three automated emails are sent to partners notifying them to submit their claims.
- Email 1: sent a day after the activity end date
- Email 2: 14-day after the activity end date has passed
- Email 3: 28 days after the activity end date has passed, alerting them once the 30-day deadline has been reached, GitLab can contractually  decline to pay if the MDF Claim is not submitted. For new partners that need to be onboarded in Coupa we are allowing a 35 day deadline.
- A communication will be made to the Channel Marketing Managers if claim has not yet been made and Channel Marketing Managers will reach out to Partners.

Once a claim is submitted MDF Program Owner receives an automated email.

- All of the files received by the partner are checked. If any documentation is missing or does not fulfill the MDF Guidelines we will reach out to partner.
- All of the documentation gets uploaded to the POP issue and the label for MDF Program Owner to review and approve.
- MDF Program Owner checks every POP issue, looking at lead list, invoice and supporting images/pdfs and approves it or tags Channel Marketing Managers if there’s a concern.
- Once approved, Teri will upload the lead list to the Lead Upload Issue.
- She will email the invoice to AP.
- She will note in Zip/Coupa - MDF Reimbursement payment is clear to pay.
- Payment can take up to 45 days once invoice is submitted to Accounts Payable.

## Canceling MDF Activities

### Channel Marketing Manager Tasks

- CMM to update Allocadia showing the MDF activity as canceled by going to the mdf sub-category panel and selecting `Yes` to the `Campaign Canceled?` dropdown. CMM to also add in `CANCELED` to the event sub-category title and to the `Official Event/Campaign Name` field so the title in the main issue stays updated.
- CMM to remove any planned/forecasted costs in Allocadia accordingly.
- CMM to ping the Channel Marketing Programs Manager (CMPM) and staff/DRI's in the main MDF epic to communicate the cancelation and close out the issue.

### Channel Marketing Programs Manager Tasks

- The CMPM will comment regarding the cancelation in all open sub-issues and close out the issues.
- If applicable, CMPM to delete the Zip req and comment that the MDF has been canceled.
- If applicable, CMPM to ping procurement and finance in the Coupa req to notify them that the MDF has been canceled.
- Once all sub-issues are closed, the CMPM will also note the cancellation in the epic and close the epic.
- The CMPM will change the MDF Request status in SFDC from `Approved` to `Cancelled` or `denied` (where applicable) if request has been submitted by the partner. By doing so the Partner will receive an automated email informing the Funds Request initially submitted has been cancelled or denied.
- SFDC: CMPM to add `[CANCELED]` to the campaign name and select `Aborted` in the `Campaign Status` dropdown. Also, unlink the `Partner Account` and unsync to `Vartopia`.
- Marketo: CMPM to delete Marketo program.

## FY25 Q2 GitLab Biz Development team to prospect leads from MDF Campaigns

- Exciting offering for our partners who are running MDF campaigns with us in FY25 Q2 (May 1, 2024 - July 31, 2024).
- At the partners election, GitLab’s in-house prospecting experts(the GitLab BDR team) will work on your behalf to surface joint opportunities from agreed MDF campaigns, allowing you and your teams to focus on the deal progression and beyond.
- Even though the GitLab BDR team will be working to surface the opportunity for you, you will still be entitled to your pricing and discounts as listed in the [partner portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/English/).

### The fine print

1. The GitLab BDR team will only work the leads from qualified MDF campaigns based on the following criteria:
   1. Leads which have scored enough points to be considered a GitLab marketing qualified lead (MQL).
   1. Are from an actively working account - regardless of how many points they have gathered [and/or] are from a group of accounts called `Actively Working Accounts` which is a set of accounts the BDR team has a specific outbound prospecting strategy for.
1. The GitLab BDR team will inform you on the records we have worked & send back to you the leads which did not meet the above criteria for your own nurturing.
