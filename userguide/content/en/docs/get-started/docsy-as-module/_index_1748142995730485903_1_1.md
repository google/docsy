## Operational Data Vision

## Vision

Our aim is to utilize operational data, encompassing license utilization, active user metrics, use cases, and feature utilization, to achieve the following objectives:

1. Facilitate Customers' Value Realization:
Enhance customers' ability to realize value from the GitLab platform swiftly, ensuring a seamless journey towards their desired business outcomes. We are committed to providing a world-class customer experience by leveraging insights derived from product usage data.

2. Enhance Value, Quality, and Usability:
Utilize data-driven insights into customer interactions with GitLab to continually improve the value proposition, quality standards, and usability of our platform. By closely analyzing how customers engage with GitLab features, we strive to enhance their experience and satisfaction.

3. Drive Net Dollar Retention and Account Expansion:
Strengthen customer relationships by efficiently retaining existing customers and supporting account expansion initiatives. Through proactive analysis of usage patterns and identifying opportunities for value addition, we aim to increase net dollar retention while facilitating organic growth within customer accounts.

By aligning our efforts with these objectives, we endeavor to optimize customer adoption, satisfaction, and overall success with the GitLab platform.

## Benefits

### Customer

Understanding a customer's use of the GitLab platform enables GitLab to:

- Ensure expected value is delivered through the adoption of the GitLab platform
- Monitor the customer's usage to ensure they are adopting licenses, use cases, and features to support their business objectives and goals
- Provide data to support delivery to a customer's return-on-investment (ROI) proposal and/or justify additional investments
- Continuously improve product value, quality, and usability by monitoring and understanding customer usage (for example, high and low usage of stages or features, user experience measurements, etc.)
- Recommend best practices and enablement content that would help customers adoption and/or operationalize the platform capabilities
- Identify and recommend additional features or use cases that would add additional value to the customer
- Identify adoption issues, delays, or barriers to trigger assistance by GitLab team members or digital content
- Proactively provide system-level support to help maintain uptime, resolve any system performance issues, and monitor for security issues

### GitLab

The benefit to GitLab is based on the premise that customers will renew and expand if they realize continuous value with a positive experience and are able to achieve their business outcomes and goals with the platform. Additionally, the data can be used to:

- Provide adoption insights to monitor and manage customer health and experiences
- Measure quality of processes and methods like onboarding, enablement content, and adoption playbooks
- Leverage customer health to manage account plans and assist planning and forecasting
- Provide efficiency through automation in both CSM-led and digitally-led engagement throughout the customer journey
- Identify customers who are at risk of attrition or churn, as well as identify potential expansion opportunities (i.e., license and/or subscription tier)

## Use Cases

*Note: The use cases, approaches, and metrics below include current and planned use cases. The following are some examples of how GitLab may use operational data. Use cases may also be dependent on customer settings or consents the customer has provided to GitLab.*

### Identifying Expansion Opportunities

1. Triggered CTA (call to action) and associated playbook for a CSM when a customer begins to adopt a new use case such as scanning. Often the central DevOps teams are not up to speed on how all of their users are using the platform. These these playbooks will guide the CSM in exploring the expansion with the customer and optimizing for this additional use case across the customer's broader user base.

### Identifying Enablement Opportunities

1. Each customer's use case adoption will be measured against a maturity matrix/score, enabling customized enablement roadmaps per use case per customer based on areas of potential improvement

### Identifying & Mitigating Risk

1. Triggered alerts in Gainsight to notify a CSM to take action when there are concerning patterns within the month over month operational data.
1. Reporting and alerts when adoption across a use case goes from 'Green' to 'Yellow' or 'Red', indicating potential movement from a team off of the platform

### Success Planning and Outcome Delivery

- When a CSM is engaged, the usage data will be a key measure for the [customer success plan](/handbook/customer-success/csm/success-plans/) to ensure the customer is successfully adopting the use cases and features to deliver to their goals and objectives. Data and metrics will be leveraged and shared throughout the engagement and in customer [Executive Business Reviews](/handbook/customer-success/csm/ebr/).
- In a digital-only engagement, the usage data will serve as a measure to ensure the customer adopts the [desired customer use cases](/handbook/customer-success/csm/success-plans/). The digital journey will be developed to serve key content to help customers adopt these use cases and progress through their customer journey.

### Onboarding

- A measure of successful onboarding includes the activation and active use of licenses and potentially use case adoption.

### Adoption and Expansion

- In alignment with a customer's goals, the adoption of the customer's desired use cases will be monitored and used to drive engagement activities based on operational data. Depending on the adoption progress, resulting actions could be:
  - CSM may provide enablement content (product documentation, educational videos, etc.), guidance on best practices and approaches, key capabilities to adopt, and/or services to ensure successful adoption.
  - CSM engages with customers to understand if there are any issues or blockers with the customer (for example, training or enablement gaps, change management delays, technical issues, configuration problems, etc.). Depending on the issue, support and/or product may be engaged to assist the customer.
  - In a digital-only engagement, relevant content could be delivered to the customer (for example, best practices, configuration guides, education/enablement videos) based on the customer's usage data.
  - When mature adoption of desired use case(s) is complete, we may recommend additional use cases or capabilities that would provide added value to the customer.
- The customer's services usage may indicate there are capabilities in a higher subscription tier that may provide additional value to the customer. This would be proposed by the CSM, sales representative, or digitally.

### Process and Playbooks

- The quality of key engagement processes and playbooks like onboarding, adoption, and expansion will be measured by usage stats to determine if changes drive desired improvements with customer adoption. Some objects may include:
  - Accelerating time-to-value and time to mature adoption of use cases
  - Improving speed or sequence of adopting features and capabilities
  - Improving customer experience and satisfaction
  - Improving the success rates at expanding into new use cases

### Product

- Measure usage of features, stages, and use cases for Product Team key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Understand usage of the product to identify and/or validate product investments to improve the product and customer experience
- Identify customers who are using certain GitLab stages or use cases for feedback (through surveys, interviews, etc.)

### Marketing

- Identify and market to community users who could get additional value from paid subscription tiers
- Utilize usage stats from customers to provide contextually relevant content and lifecycle marketing campaigns

### Metrics

- [Operationalized Usage Metrics in Gainsight/Tableau](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EhSXqx6YXcpqHg2TpS0ZN5Rk_d2hhrTPrW5FTbmuZjw/edit#gid=0)
- [License Utilization](/handbook/customer-success/product-usage-data/use-case-adoption/): Assist the customer in determining how well utilized licenses are, how they could be used, and assess their future needs
- [xMAU](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/performance-indicators/product/#three-versions-of-xmau) leverages usage stats and is a key performance indicator (KPI) for the Product Team
- Use case expansion playbook success will be measured by customer use case adoption
- Use case health score will leverage use case adoption (scored as minimum to advanced). This is used to understand which use cases have been adopted and what is the progress on adopting those use cases.
- Customer health scores (planned) will leverage use case health scores. This is used to analyze and understand the customer's overall health through engagement and depth of deployment. This will also leverage other inputs like support cases and NPS/customer sentiment surveys.
