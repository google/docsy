# Module 1 - Password Policy and Management

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Module Overview

This module will guide you through the importance of a strong password policy, how to create and manage secure passwords, and best practices to follow to ensure the safety of your personal and company data.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Why is Password Security Important?

Passwords are often the first line of defense against unauthorized access to our digital systems and sensitive information. Weak or predictable passwords make it easier for attackers to compromise accounts and data. The impact of a breached account can be severe, leading to data loss, financial loss, and damage to the company's reputation.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Understanding the Risks of Weak Passwords

Weak passwords are often a significant vulnerability in any cyber security strategy. They can be easily guessed by attackers using techniques like:

- Brute force attacks: Where software tries every possible combination to crack a password.

- Dictionary attacks: Using a list of common words and phrases to guess passwords.

- Phishing: Trickery that encourages you to give away your password willingly.

Inadequate password security can lead to:

- Data breaches where sensitive personal, financial, or business data is exposed.

- Account compromise, which can lead to financial loss or operational disruption.

- Loss of trust from clients, partners, or stakeholders.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Creating a Strong Password:

A strong password must be:

1. At least 12 characters long: The longer the password, the harder it is to crack.

1. A mixture of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters: This adds complexity.

1. Unpredictable and unique: Avoid using easily guessable personal information like your name, birthday, or simple patterns.

Guidelines to Follow When Creating a Strong Password:

1. Avoid Personal Information: Don’t use names, birthdays, or common words.

1. Use Random Combinations: Incorporate a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols in random order.

1. Create Passphrases: Use a string of unrelated words mixed with numbers and symbols, such as "BlueFish!43Coffee$".

1. No Common Sequences: Avoid predictable patterns like abc123 or password1.

Example of a weak password: password123Example of a strong password: gT!z9F@2pW6$kV1m

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Password Management Tools

Given the increasing number of accounts we use, it can be difficult to remember all our passwords. A password manager can help you store and manage your passwords securely. Password managers can generate strong passwords, store them in an encrypted vault, and automatically fill in login forms for you.

Benefits of a Password Manager:

- Secure Storage: Passwords are encrypted and stored safely.

- Password Generation: They can generate strong, unique passwords.

- Convenience: They automatically fill in login forms, so you don’t need to remember all your passwords.

How to Use a Password Manager:

- Choose a reputable password manager (e.g., LastPass, Dashlane, 1Password).

- Set up an account and use a strong master password (the one password you need to remember).

- Store all your passwords in the manager, and let it handle password generation and retrieval.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Changing Your Password Regularly

It is important to change your passwords regularly, especially if you suspect that they might have been compromised or after a security breach.

Password Change Best Practices:

- Change your passwords every 90 days.

- If you suspect that your password has been compromised, change it immediately.

- Use different passwords for different accounts (don’t use the same password across multiple sites or systems).

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

While a strong password is important, it’s not enough on its own. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring something you know (your password) and something you have (such as a mobile device for a code or app).

Why MFA is Important:

- MFA provides an additional layer of security. Even if an attacker manages to obtain your password, they cannot access your account without the second factor.

- Common methods of MFA include:

How to Set Up MFA:

1. Enable MFA in your online accounts (e.g., email, banking, company systems).

1. Download an authentication app if necessary (for example, Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator).

1. Follow the steps to link your account to the app or phone number.

1. Whenever you log in, you’ll be asked to provide a second verification factor.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Password Management Policy (Green Orbit Digital)

At Green Orbit Digital, we have a Password Management Policy that all staff must follow to ensure the security of company data and systems.

1. Use Strong Passwords: All passwords must meet the requirements outlined in this module.

1. Unique Passwords for Different Accounts: Use different passwords for work-related systems and personal accounts.

1. Password Sharing: Never share passwords via email or text. Use the password manager for sharing passwords securely.

1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): MFA must be enabled on all critical accounts.

1. Change Passwords Regularly: Update your password every 90 days or immediately if you believe it’s compromised.

1. Reporting Compromised Passwords: If you suspect that your password has been exposed or compromised, notify IT immediately.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Practical Exercise: Creating and Managing Strong Passwords

# Module 2 - Recognising and Responding to Phishing

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Module Overview

This module will help you understand what phishing is, how to recognise phishing attempts, and what steps to take if you suspect a phishing attack. By the end of this module, you will be better equipped to protect yourself and our organisation from these common cyber threats.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers attempt to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal data. This is usually done through fraudulent emails, websites, or phone calls that appear to come from a trusted source.

Phishing attacks can take many forms, but the goal is always the same: to steal your personal information or compromise security.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## How Phishing Attacks Work

Phishing attacks often follow these steps:

1. The attacker sends a fraudulent message: This could be an email, SMS (smishing), phone call (vishing), or social media message.

1. The message is designed to look legitimate: It may appear to come from someone you trust, such as your bank, a colleague, a vendor, or a reputable organisation.

1. The message creates a sense of urgency or fear: This could involve messages like "Your account has been compromised," "You need to update your password immediately," or "Click here to claim your prize."

1. The victim is tricked into clicking a link or opening an attachment: The link may lead to a fake website designed to capture sensitive data or to download malware onto the victim's device.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Types of Phishing Attacks

1. Email Phishing: The most common form. The attacker pretends to be someone you know (such as a colleague or your bank) and asks for sensitive information or directs you to a fake website.

1. Spear Phishing: A more targeted form of phishing where the attacker customizes the message to a specific individual or organisation. The attacker may gather information about you from social media or company websites to make the message seem more credible.

1. Whaling: A type of spear phishing that targets high-level executives or important figures within an organisation. The attacker might impersonate a trusted business partner or a senior executive to gain sensitive company data.

1. Smishing (SMS Phishing): A phishing attack conducted via SMS. The attacker may send a text message that appears to come from a legitimate organisation, asking you to click on a link or provide personal information.

1. Vishing (Voice Phishing): A phishing attempt made over the phone. The attacker may pose as a legitimate institution, like a bank or a government agency, to extract personal information or payment details.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## How to Spot the Signs of Phishing

Phishing emails often have several common indicators. Here’s what to look for:

### 1. Suspicious Sender Information

- The email address might look similar to a legitimate one but with small, subtle differences (e.g., "support@amaz0n.com" instead of "support@amazon.com").

- Be cautious if the sender's address looks odd or unfamiliar.

### 2. Urgent or Threatening Language

- Phishing emails often use urgent language to get you to act quickly, such as "Immediate action required!" or "Your account has been compromised!"

- Legitimate companies typically do not send threatening emails without prior communication.

### 3. Spelling and Grammar Mistakes

- Many phishing emails contain spelling errors, awkward phrasing, or poor grammar.

- Professional communications from trusted companies are typically well-written and polished.

### 4. Unsolicited Attachments or Links

- Never open attachments or click on links in an unsolicited email.

- Phishing messages often have links that lead to fake websites designed to steal your information.

### 5. Suspicious Requests for Sensitive Information

- Legitimate companies will never ask you to provide sensitive information (like your password or bank details) via email.

- Be wary of requests for information you would typically never share via email.

### 6. Too Good to Be True Offers

- Emails promising large sums of money, free gifts, or deals that sound too good to be true are often phishing attempts.

### 7. Unusual Mismatched URLs

- Hover over any link (without clicking) to see where it really leads. If the URL doesn't match the sender’s website or looks suspicious, it's likely a phishing attempt.

- Look for small alterations in domain names (e.g., "secure-apple.com" instead of "apple.com").

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Steps to Take if You Suspect Phishing

If you suspect you’ve received a phishing attempt, it’s important to take immediate action:

### Step 1: Do Not Click Links or Open Attachments

- If you suspect the email is a phishing attempt, do not click any links or open any attachments. These may contain malware or lead you to fraudulent websites.

### Step 2: Verify the Email or Message

- If the email appears to come from a trusted source, contact the sender through a different communication method (e.g., phone or official website) to verify the request.

- Do not reply directly to the email or use the contact details provided in the message.

### Step 3: Report the Suspicious Message

- If you believe you’ve received a phishing email, report it immediately to your IT or security team, or follow your organisation's internal reporting process (see below).

- Forward the email to your designated internal phishing reporting address (e.g., phishing@greenorbitdigital.com) for further investigation.

### Step 4: Delete the Suspicious Email

- After reporting, delete the email from your inbox. If you opened any attachments, run a security scan on your device.

# Module 3 - Protecting Your Data on Public Wi-Fi

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Module Overview:

This module focuses on the risks associated with using public Wi-Fi networks and offers strategies to protect your data when you’re connected to these networks. Public Wi-Fi is convenient but can also expose you to significant security threats. By the end of this module, you will understand the vulnerabilities of public Wi-Fi hotspots and learn how to mitigate those risks using various tools and practices.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## What is Public Wi-Fi?

Public Wi-Fi refers to any Wi-Fi network that is freely available for public use. You can often find these networks in places like cafes, airports, libraries, shopping centres, and hotels. While convenient, public Wi-Fi networks can pose a significant security risk because they are typically unsecured and may be monitored by cybercriminals.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Vulnerabilities of Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks are often not protected by the encryption standards that secure private Wi-Fi networks. This means that data transmitted over these networks can be intercepted by malicious individuals. Here are the key risks associated with public Wi-Fi:

1. Eavesdropping (Man-in-the-Middle Attacks):

1. Fake Wi-Fi Networks (Evil Twin Attacks):

1. Session Hijacking:

1. Malware Distribution:

1. No Encryption:

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Risks of Public Wi-Fi in Business Environments

When using public Wi-Fi for work-related tasks, these risks can extend to your company’s sensitive data, potentially leading to a breach of internal security policies. The exposure of company emails, client data, financial information, and proprietary business details can be disastrous. For this reason, it’s crucial that business-sensitive activities are never conducted over unsecured Wi-Fi without proper protection.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## How to Protect Your Data on Public Wi-Fi

There are several ways to safeguard your data when using public Wi-Fi networks. Here’s what you can do:

### 1. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network)

A VPN encrypts your internet connection, making it secure even on public Wi-Fi. It routes your internet traffic through a private server, hiding your IP address and encrypting your data to prevent it from being intercepted. This is the most effective way to protect your online activities.

Steps to Use a VPN:

- Install a reliable VPN app on your device.

- Before connecting to public Wi-Fi, turn on the VPN to ensure that your data is encrypted.

- Keep the VPN connected while using public networks.

### 2. Enable HTTPS Everywhere

Whenever possible, always connect to websites that use HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) rather than HTTP. HTTPS encrypts the data exchanged between your browser and the website, providing a secure connection.

How to Enable HTTPS:

- Ensure that any website you visit has a secure connection by checking for the padlock symbol next to the URL.

- You can install a browser extension like “HTTPS Everywhere” to automatically force HTTPS on websites that support it.

### 3. Turn Off Sharing and Public File Access

When you connect to a public Wi-Fi network, it’s a good idea to disable sharing settings on your device. This will prevent unauthorized access to your files and sensitive data.

How to Turn Off File Sharing:

- On Windows, go to Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change advanced sharing settings and disable file and printer sharing.

- On macOS, go to System Preferences > Sharing and uncheck any services (e.g., File Sharing, AirDrop).

### 4. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

For added security, enable two-factor authentication on any accounts that support it. Even if an attacker intercepts your login credentials, they will not be able to access your account without the second layer of security (usually a code sent to your phone or email).

Steps to Enable 2FA:

- Check if the services you use offer 2FA (e.g., email, banking, cloud services).

- Follow the service’s instructions to set up 2FA using your phone or an authentication app (e.g., Google Authenticator).

### 5. Disable Auto-Connect to Wi-Fi

Many devices automatically connect to available Wi-Fi networks. This can be risky if your device connects to a fake hotspot without your knowledge. Always turn off the auto-connect feature on your device.

How to Disable Auto-Connect:

- On iOS: Go to Settings > Wi-Fi and turn off Auto-Join.

- On Android: Go to Settings > Wi-Fi > Advanced and disable Connect to open networks.

### 6. Avoid Accessing Sensitive Accounts

Avoid logging into sensitive accounts, such as banking, email, or company systems, while on public Wi-Fi unless you are using a VPN. If possible, reserve sensitive activities for a more secure network (such as your home or office Wi-Fi).

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Alternative Options to Public Wi-Fi

If you don’t want to risk using public Wi-Fi, here are some safer alternatives:

### 1. Mobile Data Connection

Using your mobile phone’s data connection is a safer option than public Wi-Fi. Mobile data is encrypted and generally offers better security than unsecured Wi-Fi.

How to Use Mobile Data:

- Enable your phone’s hotspot feature and connect your device directly to the mobile network, bypassing public Wi-Fi.

- Ensure that you have a data plan that can support your usage while connected to the mobile network.

### 2. Personal Hotspot (Mi-Fi)

If you need a portable connection, consider using a personal hotspot device (Mi-Fi). This device creates a private and secure Wi-Fi network using your mobile data. It’s more secure than using public Wi-Fi, and you can control who connects to it.

Benefits of Personal Hotspots:

- Provides a secure, private network.

- No risk of connecting to fake or malicious Wi-Fi hotspots.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## How Green Orbit Digital Handles Public Wi-Fi Use

At Green Orbit Digital, we take the security of our data seriously. For employees who need to work while on the go or when using public Wi-Fi, the following guidelines are in place:

1. VPN Usage is Mandatory: Always use the company-approved VPN when connecting to public Wi-Fi or unsecured networks. This ensures that your internet traffic is encrypted.

1. Restricted Access: Do not access company systems, databases, or sensitive client information unless absolutely necessary while on public Wi-Fi.

1. Report Security Concerns: If you suspect that your device has been compromised or if you notice suspicious activity while connected to public Wi-Fi, immediately report it to the IT team.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Practical Exercise: Securing Your Device on Public Wi-Fi

### Exercise 1: VPN Setup

- Install and configure a VPN on your device if you haven’t already done so.

- Practice connecting to public Wi-Fi with the VPN enabled, and check that your traffic is encrypted.

## What is an Incident Response Plan (IRP)?

An Incident Response Plan (IRP) is a set of documented procedures that your organisation follows to handle cyber security incidents, data breaches, or other security events. The goal of an IRP is to respond quickly to minimise damage and recover operations as efficiently as possible.

Key stages of an Incident Response Plan:

1. Preparation: Creating an incident response team and defining roles and responsibilities.

1. Identification: Recognising and detecting the incident as quickly as possible.

1. Containment: Preventing further damage by isolating the affected systems or data.

1. Eradication: Removing the root cause of the incident (e.g., malware, vulnerabilities).

1. Recovery: Restoring affected systems and data to normal operation.

1. Lessons Learned: Conducting a post-incident review to identify improvements in response processes.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### Recognising a Cyber Incident or Data Breach

It’s crucial to identify when an incident occurs so that it can be properly contained and addressed. Here are some common indicators of a data breach or cyber incident:

### Signs of a Cyber Incident or Data Breach:

- Suspicious Account Activity: Unexplained logins, password changes, or failed login attempts.

- Unusual Network Activity: A sudden spike in network traffic or unfamiliar devices connecting to the network.

- System Slowdowns or Crashes: If your system becomes sluggish or crashes unexpectedly, it could be a sign of an ongoing attack.

- Missing or Altered Data: Files or data being altered, deleted, or becoming inaccessible without explanation.

- Phishing Attempts: A sudden increase in suspicious emails, especially those that attempt to trick users into providing sensitive information.

- Security Alerts: Notifications from antivirus software, firewalls, or intrusion detection systems indicating suspicious activity.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Internal Reporting Process

If you suspect or identify an incident or breach, it’s important to report it through the correct channels immediately. Delays in reporting can lead to prolonged exposure to threats and damage.

### Steps to Take When Suspecting an Incident

1. Do Not Attempt to Resolve It Yourself: Avoid taking steps that could make the situation worse (e.g., trying to fix malware without expertise).

1. Report the Incident Immediately:

1. Preserve Evidence: Do not delete, alter, or interact with the affected system beyond reporting the incident. Preserving evidence is critical for forensic investigations and legal compliance.

1. Isolate the Affected Systems: If possible, disconnect the compromised system from the network to limit further damage. Ensure you have approval from the incident response team before taking such actions.

# Module 8 - Advanced Security Practices for Critical Systems and Data

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Module Overview

In this module, we will focus on the protection of critical business systems and sensitive data. Securing these assets is vital for business continuity, as any compromise could have significant financial, reputational, and legal consequences. We will also discuss Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity planning to ensure your organisation can recover quickly from incidents and continue operations with minimal disruption.

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the importance of securing business-critical systems and sensitive data.

- Implement best practices for securing data storage, transmission, and access.

- Learn how to plan and implement Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity (BC) strategies.

- Identify and mitigate risks to critical systems.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Securing Critical Business Systems

Critical business systems are the backbone of your organisation. They include the systems that handle core operations, financial transactions, customer data, intellectual property, and communications. If these systems are compromised, it can severely impact business operations and reputation.

### Best Practices for Securing Critical Systems

1. Network Segmentation: Dividing the network into segments can limit the spread of any attack. For example, separating sensitive data systems from general employee workstations helps contain potential breaches.

1. Access Control: Use least privilege principles. Only allow employees access to the systems and data they need to perform their job roles. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and enforce strong authentication methods like multi-factor authentication (MFA).

1. Regular Patching and Updates: Ensure that all critical systems have the latest security patches installed. Unpatched systems are a primary target for cybercriminals exploiting known vulnerabilities.

1. End-to-End Encryption: All sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit (while being sent over the network) and at rest (while stored in databases or cloud environments). Use strong encryption algorithms, such as AES-256, to ensure data is protected.

1. Monitoring and Logging: Continuously monitor your critical systems for any unusual or unauthorised activity. Ensure logging is enabled on key systems and that logs are regularly reviewed for signs of potential breaches or attacks.

### Identifying and Mitigating Risks

- Risk Assessment: Conduct regular risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in your critical systems. This could include conducting vulnerability scans, penetration testing, and assessing both internal and external threats.

- Third-Party Risk: Assess the security posture of third-party vendors who have access to your critical systems. Ensure they comply with your security requirements and have their own robust security measures in place.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Securing Sensitive Data

Sensitive data includes personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, intellectual property, trade secrets, and customer information. Any exposure of this data could lead to financial loss, legal action, and reputational damage.

### Best Practices for Data Security

1. Data Encryption: As mentioned earlier, encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest. Ensure that encryption keys are managed securely, and implement strong password policies for accessing encrypted data.

1. Data Minimisation: Only collect the data you need and retain it for the minimum time necessary. Implement automatic deletion procedures for data that is no longer needed to reduce your data exposure risk.

1. Data Masking: When working with sensitive data in non-production environments (e.g., during development or testing), use data masking to obfuscate actual data. This helps ensure that even if a breach occurs, the data exposed is not usable.

1. Regular Backups: Regularly back up sensitive data and critical systems. Store backups in a secure location, ideally offsite or in the cloud with strong encryption. Ensure backup integrity by periodically testing backup restoration processes.

1. Access Controls for Data: Implement strict access controls and audit trails for who can view, edit, or delete sensitive data. Only authorised personnel should be allowed access, and access should be revoked immediately when no longer needed.

1. Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Implement DLP tools to monitor for and prevent the unauthorized sharing, movement, or storage of sensitive data outside of approved locations.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Disaster Recovery (DR) Planning

Disaster Recovery (DR) refers to the strategies and processes used to recover and restore critical business systems, applications, and data in the event of a disaster, whether that’s a natural disaster, cyberattack, or system failure.

### Key Elements of a DR Plan

1. Business Impact Analysis (BIA): Determine which systems and data are essential for business continuity. Assess the potential financial, operational, and reputational impact of losing access to these systems.

1. Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Define the maximum acceptable downtime for each critical system. RTO helps determine the resources required for recovery and how quickly systems need to be restored.

1. Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Define the maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time (e.g., 24 hours). RPO helps define how frequently backups should occur and how much data can be lost without significant impact.

1. Redundancy: Implement system redundancy, such as using mirrored servers or cloud backups, to ensure that critical systems remain available in case of failure.

1. Testing the Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan : Regularly test your DR plan with simulated exercises to ensure that your team is prepared and the plan is effective. These tests should cover different disaster scenarios, including cyberattacks, system failures, and natural disasters.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Business Continuity (BC) Planning

Business Continuity (BC) is the ability of an organisation to continue operations despite significant disruptions. A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) ensures that critical business functions can continue during and after an incident.

### Key Elements of a BC Plan

1. Critical Business Functions: Identify and prioritise the key business processes that must continue during a disruption (e.g., sales, customer support, supply chain management).

1. Alternative Facilities: If your primary location becomes unavailable, consider having a secondary site or working from remote locations. Cloud-based services can also provide access to critical business functions from anywhere.

1. Communication Plan: Ensure there is a clear communication strategy in place to keep employees, customers, and stakeholders informed. This includes phone trees, internal messaging systems, and external communications.

1. Employee Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of employees during a business disruption. Ensure everyone knows their role in both the DR and BC processes.

1. Documentation and Access: Maintain all critical business documents, contacts, and instructions in a secure, accessible location. This can include moving to cloud-based solutions for easier access during a disaster.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Practical Exercise: Developing a Disaster Recovery Plan

Your organisation experiences a major data breach that affects several critical systems. Customer data has been stolen, and you are unable to access key business applications.

Exercise Steps:

1. Identify the Impacted Systems: List which systems and applications are impacted and assess the severity of the breach.

1. Activate the DR Plan: Begin the recovery process by prioritising the systems based on the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO).

1. Communicate with Stakeholders: Alert internal and external stakeholders about the incident and your recovery efforts.

1. Restore Critical Systems: Recover from backups, and ensure that systems are secure before bringing them back online.

1. Test the Systems: After restoration, test the systems to ensure they are functioning properly and securely.
