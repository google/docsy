## What are Zendesk views?

As per [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408888828570-Creating-views-to-build-customized-lists-of-tickets):

> Views are a way to organize your tickets by grouping them into lists based on certain criteria. For example, you can create a view for unsolved tickets that are assigned to you, a view for new tickets that need to be triaged, or a view for pending tickets that are awaiting response. Using views can help you determine what tickets need attention from you or your team and plan accordingly.

Currently, Zendesk has 3 view types:

- Default: Pre-defined views created by Zendesk
- Shared: Views created by the Zendesk Administrator(s) (ie. Customer Support Operations)
- Personal: Views created by you and usable only by you

Currently, Zendesk views have some limitations:

- Views cannot use criteria that is not "defined", meaning it must be selectable data (text fields will not work, as an example).
- You can only display up to 100 shared views
- You can only display up to 10 personal views
- Views will not include [archived tickets](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408887617050-About-ticket-archiving) (i.e. Closed tickets after 120 days.)
