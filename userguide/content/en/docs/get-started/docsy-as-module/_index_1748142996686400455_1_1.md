## Summary

The AI-gateway is a standalone-service that will give access to AI
features to all users of GitLab, no matter which instance they are
using: self-managed, dedicated or GitLab.com.

Initially, all AI-gateway deployments will be managed by GitLab (the
organization), and GitLab.com and all GitLab self-managed instances
will use the same gateway. However, in the future we could also deploy
regional gateways, or even customer-specific gateways if the need
arises.

The AI-Gateway is an API-Gateway that handles traffic steered to it from a
globally reachable `cloud.gitlab.com/ai/*` route. IDEs currently use `cloud.gitlab.com/ai/*`
indirectly through a GitLab Rails instance. In
future we plan to allow network endpoints such as IDEs to connect directly to
`cloud.gitlab.com` (for more information, see [directly connected clients](#directly-connected-clients)).
The AI-Gateway then directs this traffic to other services, in this case
AI-providers and their models. This north/south traffic pattern allows us to
control what requests go where and to translate the content of the redirected
request where needed.

**Currently, multi-region deployment is not supported; it's a feature under consideration. The existing diagram illustrates a potential architecture for deploying across multiple regions.**

[Diagram source](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1xhGElN4rGvCY-SOvSkRpSdZ_MZ3IgVQiiTlKQpkPyLE/edit)

By using a hosted service under the control of GitLab we can ensure
that we provide all GitLab instances with AI features in a scalable
way. It is easier to scale this small stateless service, than scaling
GitLab Rails with its dependencies (database, Redis).

It allows users of self-managed installations to have access to
features using AI without them having to host their own models or
connect to 3rd party providers.

## Language: Python

The AI-Gateway was originally started as the "model-gateway" that
handled requests from IDEs to provide Code Suggestions. It was written
in Python.

Python is an object oriented language that is familiar enough for
Rubyists to pick up through in the younger codebase that is the
AI-gateway. It also makes it easy for data- and ML-engineers that
already have Python experience to contribute.

## Directly connected clients

Direct connections are not supported yet and this work is tracked in
[this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/12224#proposed-solution).

Decision: [ADR-001: Allow direct connections](decisions/001_direct_connections.md)

Code completion requests will be sent directly from a client to AI Gateway to
improve latency of these requests. It will be up to the client to decide if a
request can be sent directly to AI Gateway or to GitLab Rails for additional
enrichment. Usage of direct connections will be optional and backward
compatible. If a client will not support detection of completion requests, it
can still send these requests through GitLab Rails (as is now) without
specifying the type of code suggestion request.

## API

### Basic stable API for the AI-gateway

Because the API of the AI-gateway will be consumed by a wide variety
of clients, it is important that we design a stable, yet flexible API.

To do this, we can implement an API-endpoint per use-case we
build. This means that the interface between client and the AI-gateway
is one that we build and own. This ensures future scalability,
composability and security.

The API is not versioned, but is backward compatible. See [cross version compatibility](#cross-version-compatibility)
for details. The AI-gateway will support the last 2 major
versions. For example when working on GitLab 17.2, we would support
both GitLab 17 and GitLab 16.

Because clients can connect directly to AI Gateway, common functionality like
rate-limiting, circuit-breakers and secret redaction should be added both at
this level of the stack as well as in GitLab Rails.

#### Protocol

The communication between the AI-Gateway service and its clients (including the GitLab Rails application) shall use a JSON-based API.

The AI-Gateway API shall expose single-purpose endpoints responsible for providing access to different AI features. [A later section](#single-purpose-endpoints) of this document provides detailed guidelines for building specific endpoints.

The AI Gateway communication protocol shall only expect a rudimentary envelope that wraps all feature-specific dynamic information. The proposed architecture of the protocol allows the API endpoints to be version agnostic, and the AI-Gateway APIs compatible with multiple versions of GitLab(or other clients that use the gateway).

 **This means
that all clients regardless of their versions use the same set of AI-Gateway API feature endpoints. The AI-gateway feature endpoints have to support different client versions, instead of creating multiple feature endpoints per different supported client versions**.

We can however add a version to the path in case we do want to evolve
a certain endpoint. It's not expected that we'll need to do this
often, but having a version in the path keeps the option open. The
benefit of this is that individual GitLab milestone releases will
continue pointing to the endpoint version it was tested against at the
time of release, while allowing us to iterate quickly by introducing
new endpoint versions.

We also considered gRPC as a protocol for communication between
GitLab instances, JSON API, and gRPC differ on these items:

| gRPC                                                                                                                                                                    | REST + JSON                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| + Strict protocol definition that is easier to evolve versionless                                                                                                       | - No strict schema, so the implementation needs to take good care of supporting multiple versions |
| + A new Ruby-gRPC server for vscode: likely faster because we can limit dependencies to load ([modular monolith](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/365293)) | - Existing Grape API for vscode: meaning slow boot time and unneeded resources loaded             |
| + Bi-directional streaming                                                                                                                                              | - Straight forward way to stream requests and responses (could still be added)                    |
| - A new Python-gRPC server: we don't have experience running gRPC-Python servers                                                                                        | + Existing Python fastapi server, already running for Code Suggestions to extend                  |
| - Hard to pass on unknown messages from vscode through GitLab to ai-gateway                                                                                             | + Easier support for newer VS Code + newer AI-gateway, through old GitLab instance                  |
| - Unknown support for gRPC in other clients (vscode, jetbrains, other editors)                                                                                          | + Support in all external clients                                                                 |
| - Possible protocol mismatch (VSCode --REST--> Rails --gRPC--> AI gateway)                                                                                              | + Same protocol across the stack                                                                  |

**Discussion:** Because we chose REST+JSON in this iteration to port
features that already partially exist does not mean we need to exclude
new features using gRPC or Websockets. For example: Chat features
might be better served by streaming requests and responses. Since we
are suggesting an endpoint per use-case, different features could also
opt for different protocols, as long as we keep cross-version
compatibility in mind.

#### Single purpose endpoints

For features using AI, we prefer building a single purpose endpoint
with a stable API over the [provider API we expose](#exposing-ai-providers)
as a direct proxy.

Some features will have specific endpoints, while others can share
endpoints. For example, Code Suggestions or chat could have their own
endpoint, while several features that summarize issues or merge
requests could use the same endpoint but make the distinction on what
information is provided in the payload.

Our goal is to minimize code that we can't update on a customer's behalf, which means avoiding hard-coding AI-related logic in the GitLab monolith codebase:

- We want to minimize the time required for customers to adopt our latest features, and
- We want to retain the flexibility to make changes in our product without breaking support for a long-tail of older instances.
- We want to be able to serve all GitLab distributions (.com SaaS, Self-managed, and Dedicated) with minimal complexity.
- We want to isolate AI capabilities to reduce risk and have a unified control plane.
- We want to provide a unified implementation that can support our "best-in-class" multi-model ensemble approach allowing us to easily support many AI models and AI vendors.
- We want a single point for controlling and measuring cost.
- As much as possible, we want to track metrics (usage statistics, failures to respond, usage pattern, question categories, etc.) in the gateway rather than distributed across many points. (Of course some metrics can only be captured on the client side.)

Having the business logic in GitLab Rails requires customers to upgrade their GitLab instances, which affects the first point. Some of the on-premises users cannot upgrade their instances immediately due to their company policy.
For example, if we had a bug in a prompt template in GitLab Rails and fixed it in 16.6, and customers are using 16.5 and the next upgrade is scheduled in 3 months, they have to use the buggy feature for 3 months.

**This does not mean that prompts need to be built inside the
AI-gateway.** But if prompts are part of the payload to a single
purpose endpoint, the payload needs to specify which model they were
built for along with other metadata about the prompts. By doing this,
we can gracefully degrade or otherwise try to support the request if
one of the prompt payloads is no longer supported by the AI
gateway. It allows us to potentially avoid breaking features in older
GitLab installations as the AI landscape changes.

### The AI-Gateway API protocol

It is important to build each single-purpose endpoint, in a version-agnostic way so it can be used by different GitLab instances and by external clients. To achieve this goal:

**The AI-Gateway protocol shall rely on a simple JSON envelope wrapping all feature-specific information.** The AI-Gateway protocol can be seen as a transport layer protocol from [the OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) (eg: TCP, UDP) which defines how to transport information between nodes, without being aware of what information is being transported.

The AI-Gateway protocol does not specify which information received by single-purpose endpoint should be processed and in which way. Providing endpoint with the freedom to decide if they will use data coming from each protocol envelope or ignore it.

The AI-Gateway protocol defines each request in the following way:

1. Each single-purpose endpoint shall accept requests containing a single JSON object with a single key: `prompt_components`.
1. The `prompt_components` key shall contain an array of JSON envelopes that are built according to the following rules:

Each JSON envelope contains 3 elements:

1. `type`: A string identifier specifying a type of information that is being presented in the envelopes
   `payload`. The AI-gateway single-purpose endpoint may ignore any types it does not know about.
1. `payload`: The actual information that can be used by the AI-Gateway single-purpose endpoint to send requests to 3rd party AI services providers. The data inside the `payload` element can differ depending on the `type`, and the version of
   the client providing the `payload`. This means that the AI-Gateway
   single-purpose endpoint must consider the structure and the type of data present inside the `payload` optional, and gracefully handle missing or malformed information.
1. `metadata`: This field contains information about a client that built this `prompt_components` envelope. Information from the `metadata` field may, or may not be used by GitLab for
   telemetry. The same as with the `payload` all fields inside the `metadata` shall be considered optional.

The only envelope field that is expected to likely change often is the
`payload` one. There we need to make sure that all fields are
optional and avoid renaming, removing, or repurposing fields.

To document and validate the content of `payload` we can specify their
format using [JSON-schema](https://json-schema.org/).

An example request according to the AI-Gateway component looks as follows:

```json
{
  "prompt_components": [
    {
      "type": "prompt",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "GitLab EE",
        "version": "16.7.0-pre",
      },
      "payload": {
        "content": "...",
        "params": {
          "temperature": 0.2,
          "maxOutputTokens": 1024
        },
        "model": "code-gecko",
        "provider": "vertex-ai"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "editor_content",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "vscode",
        "version": "1.1.1"
      },
       "payload": {
        "filename": "application.rb",
        "before_cursor": "require 'active_record/railtie'",
        "after_cursor": "\nrequire 'action_controller/railtie'",
        "open_files": [
          {
            "filename": "app/controllers/application_controller.rb",
            "content": "class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base..."
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Another example use case includes 2 versions of a prompt passed in the `prompt_components` payload. Where each version is tailored for different 3rd party AI model provider:

```json
{
  prompt_components: [
    {
      "type": "prompt",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "GitLab EE",
        "version": "16.7.0-pre",
      },
      "payload": {
        "content": "You can fetch information about a resource called an issue...",
        "params": {
          "temperature": 0.2,
          "maxOutputTokens": 1024
        },
        "model": "text-bison",
        "provider": "vertex-ai"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "prompt",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "GitLab EE",
        "version": "16.7.0-pre",
      },
      "payload": {
        "content": "System: You can fetch information about a resource called an issue...\n\nHuman:",
        "params": {
          "temperature": 0.2,
        },
        "model": "claude-2",
        "provider": "anthropic"
      }
    }

  ]
}
```

#### Cross-version compatibility

**When renaming, removing, or repurposing fields inside `payload` is needed, a single-purpose endpoint that uses the affected envelope type must build support for the old versions of
a field in the gateway, and keep them around for at least 2 major
versions of GitLab.**

A good practice that might help support backward compatibility: provide building blocks for the prompt inside the `prompt_components`, rather then a complete prompt. By moving responsibility of compiling the prompt out of building blocks and into the AI-Gateway, more flexible prompt adjustments are possible in the future.

#### Example feature: Code Suggestions

For example, a rough Code Suggestions service could look like this:

```plaintext
POST /v3/code/completions
```

```json
{
  "prompt_components": [
    {
      "type": "prompt",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "GitLab EE",
        "version": "16.7.0-pre",
      },
      "payload": {
        "content": "...",
        "params": {
          "temperature": 0.2,
          "maxOutputTokens": 1024
        },
        "model": "code-gecko",
        "provider": "vertex-ai"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "editor_content",
      "metadata": {
        "source": "vscode",
        "version": "1.1.1"
      },
       "payload": {
        "filename": "application.rb",
        "before_cursor": "require 'active_record/railtie'",
        "after_cursor": "\nrequire 'action_controller/railtie'",
        "open_files": [
          {
            "filename": "app/controllers/application_controller.rb",
            "content": "class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base..."
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

A response could look like this:

```json
{
  "response": "require 'something/else'",
  "metadata": {
    "identifier": "deadbeef",
    "model": "code-gecko",
    "timestamp": 1688118443
  }
}
```

The `metadata` field contains information that could be used in a
telemetry endpoint on the AI-gateway where we could count
suggestion-acceptance rates among other things.

The way we will receive telemetry for Code Suggestions is being
discussed in [#415745](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415745).
We will try to come up with an architecture for all AI-related features.

#### Exposing AI providers

A lot of AI functionality has already been built into GitLab Rails
that currently builds prompts and submits this directly to different
AI providers. At the time of writing, GitLab has API-clients for the
following providers:

- [Anthropic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/4344729240496a5018e19a82030d6d4b227e9c79/ee/lib/gitlab/llm/anthropic/client.rb#L6)
- [Vertex](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/4344729240496a5018e19a82030d6d4b227e9c79/ee/lib/gitlab/llm/vertex_ai/client.rb#L6)

To make these features available to self-managed instances, we should
provide endpoints for each of these that GitLab.com, self-managed or
dedicated installations can use to give these customers to these
features.

In a first iteration we could build endpoints that proxy the request
to the AI provider. This should make it easier to migrate to routing
these requests through the AI-Gateway. As an example, the endpoint for
Anthropic could look like this:

```plaintext
POST /internal/proxy/anthropic/(*endpoint)
```

The `*endpoint` means that the client specifies what is going to be
called, for example `/v1/complete`. The request body is entirely
forwarded to the AI provider. The AI-gateway makes sure the request is
correctly authenticated.

Having the proxy in between GitLab and the AI provider means that we
still have control over what goes through to the AI provider and if
the need arises, we can manipulate or reroute the request to a
different provider. Doing this means that we could keep supporting
the features of older GitLab installations even if the provider's API
changes or we decide not to work with a certain provider anymore.

I think there is value in moving features that use API providers
directly to a feature-specific purpose built API. Doing this means
that we can improve these features as AI providers evolve by changing
the AI-gateway that is under our control. Customers using self-managed
or dedicated installations could then start getting better
AI-supported features without having to upgrade their GitLab instance.

Features that are currently
[experimental](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/development_stages_support.html#experiment)
can use these generic APIs, but we should aim to convert to a single
purpose API endpoint before we make the feature [generally available](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/development_stages_support.html#generally-available-ga)
for self-managed installations. This makes it easier for us to support
features long-term even if the landscape of AI providers change.

### API in GitLab instances

This is the API that external clients can consume on their local
GitLab instance. For example VSCode that talks to a self-managed
instance.

These versions could also widely defer: it could be that the VSCode
extension is kept up-to-date by developers. But the GitLab instance
they use for work is kept a minor version behind. So the same
requirements in terms of stability and flexibility apply for the
clients as for the AI gateway.

In a first iteration we could consider keeping the current REST
payloads that the VSCode extension and the Web-IDE send, but direct it
to the appropriate GitLab installation. GitLab Rails can wrap the
payload in an envelope for the AI-gateway without having to interpret
it.

When we do this then the GitLab-instance that receives the request
from the extension doesn't need to understand it to enrich it and pass
it on to the AI-Gateway. GitLab can add information to the
`prompt_components` and pass everything that was already there
straight through to the AI-gateway.

If a request is initiated from another client (for example VSCode),
GitLab Rails needs to forward the entire payload in addition to any
other enhancements and prompts. This is required so we can potentially
support changes from a newer version of the client, traveling through
an outdated GitLab installation to a recent AI-gateway.

**Discussion:** This first iteration is also using a REST+JSON
approach. This is how the VSCode extension is currently communicating
with the model gateway. This means that it's a smaller iteration to go
from that, to wrapping that existing payload into an envelope. With
the added advantage of cross version compatibility. But it does not
mean that future iterations also need to use REST+JSON. As each
feature would have it's own endpoint, the protocol could also be
different.

## Authentication & Authorization

GitLab provides the first layer of authorization by authenticating the user and checking if the license permits using the requested feature. This is accomplished using the existing authentication, policy, and license checks built into GitLab.

Authenticating the GitLab instance on the AI-gateway was discussed in:

- [Issue 177](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist/-/issues/177)
- [Epic 10808](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10808)

The specific mechanism by which trust is delegated between end-users, GitLab instances, and the AI-gateway is detailed in the [Cloud Connector access control documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/cloud_connector/architecture.html#access-control).

The AI Gateway, as a backend service, handles instance authentication among other tasks. It is accessed through the Cloud Connector Load Balancer (currently implemented as Cloudflare), which acts as a Web Application Firewall (WAF) layer but does not perform authentication. The AI Gateway also needs to support end-user authentication because some requests, such as code completion, will be sent directly by clients rather than indirectly through GitLab Rails. A possible solution involving short-term user tokens is described in [Epic 13252](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/13252). The AI Gateway must distinguish between requests proxied by GitLab Rails and direct client requests, as some endpoints or parameters may not be available for direct requests (e.g., clients should only send sub-components of the final prompt, which the AI Gateway will build).

The AI Gateway uses JSON-based API communication and relies on JWTs for authentication. These JWTs are generally scoped to the GitLab instance and are obtained using a PAT or OAuth token. For Code Completions, a short-lived user-bound JWT is used, allowing direct communication between the client and the AI Gateway, bypassing the need to go through the GitLab instance for each request. This short-lived JWT is valid for one hour, reducing the number of JWTs needed for multiple prompt requests.

When a client initiates a prompt in GitLab Duo Chat or an IDE, the prompts, telemetry, context, and JWT token are packaged and transmitted using TLS. It is important to note that the payload itself is not encrypted; it is passed as plain text in JSON format within the request body. This approach is consistent for calls to third-party models where only tunnel-level TLS encryption is used via HTTPS.

The AI Gateway operates within GitLab hosted infrastructure, interfacing with APIs hosted in GitLab accounts for providers like Anthropic and Vertex. Models are hosted as frozen versions of Google's models within GitLab GCP tenancy, using private endpoints within the security perimeter. While prompts from different customers use the same shared model, each session maintains a user-level connection to ensure isolation.

The AI Gateway is designed as a stateless service, meaning it does not store any customer-specific data. Decryption of payloads occurs at the network layer rather than the application layer, and encryption keys are generated per request using GKE native GCP processes. Requests to Anthropic APIs are made via the public internet, whereas requests to Vertex AI models are optimized by being co-located within the same GCP region. All connections are secured with TLS/HTTPS to ensure encrypted communication throughout the data flow.

## Embeddings

NOTE:
For the embedding database, see [RAG for GitLab Duo](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/gitlab_duo_rag/index.html).

Embeddings can be requested for all features in a single endpoint, for
example through a request like this:

```plaintext
POST /internal/embeddings
```

```json
{
  "content": "The lazy fox and the jumping dog",
  "content_type": "issue_title",
  "metadata": {
    "source": "GitLab EE",
    "version": "16.3"
  }
}
```

The `content_type` and properties `content` could in the future be
used to create embeddings from different models based on what is
appropriate.

The response will include the embedding vector besides the used
provider and model. For example:

```json
{
  "response": [0.2, -1, ...],
  "metadata": {
    "identifier": "8badf00d",
    "model": "text-embedding-ada-002",
    "provider": "open_ai",
  }
}
```

When storing the embedding, we should make sure we include the model
and provider data. When embeddings are used to generate a prompt, we
could include that metadata in the payload so we can judge the quality
of the embedding.

## Deployment

Currently, the model-gateway that will become the AI-gateway is being
deployed using from the project repository in
[`gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist).

It is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster in it's own project. There is a
staging environment that is currently used directly by engineers for
testing.

In the future, this will be deployed using
[Runway](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/platform/runway/). At
that time, there will be a production and staging deployment. The
staging deployment can be used for automated QA-runs that will have
the potential to stop a deployment from reaching production.

Further testing strategy is being discussed in
[&10563](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10563).

### Self-hosted deployment of AI Gateway

Customers within self-hosted environments can also deploy a self-hosted
version of AIGW, enabling usage of Duo features even within airgapped
solutions, including those requiring FedRAMP compliance. This approach
allows us to serve sophisticated customers capable of managing their
own LLM infrastructure, providing them with more control and flexibility.
Instructions on how to setup AIGW on self-managed are found in
our [docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/self_hosted_models/install_infrastructure.html).

While this adds another component to be installed, the alternative would be
to implement a model interface in the monolith. This presents serveral
challenges, including:

- Need to reimplement in Ruby all libraries that exist in Python for LLM handling
- Duplicate codebases and maintainance
- Lack of feature parity between self-hosted and `.com`
- Difficult logging and tracing for self-hosted customers

Relying on AI Gateway for both self-hosted and `.com` environments on the other hand
centralizes the infrastructure challenges and solution when dealing with interfacing
with LLMs.

#### AI Gateway and GitLab version matching

Customers need a clear indication of which AIGW version is compatible to their GitLab instance.
Since AI Gateway deploument is not managed by Omnibus/GNG, we achieve this by providing image tags
for each GitLab version: an AIGW image with TAG `gitlab-17.2-ee` is compatible with GitLab version `17.2-ee`.

## Alternative solutions

Alternative solutions were discussed in
[applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist#161](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/modelops/applied-ml/code-suggestions/ai-assist/-/issues/161#what-are-the-alternatives).

## Future work

AI Gateway aim is to become the primary method for the monolith to **access** machine learning models across all usages of GitLab and create a consistent user journey when developing AI-backed features. To do so, these goal is split down into three categories:

- Centralized Access Through AI Gateway
- Unit Primitives

### Centralized Access Through AI Gateway

The AI Gateway, a standalone service, is the sole access point for all communication between GitLab installations and third-party AI models. It is designed to centralize and manage access to all GitLab features, whether they are in-app functionalities or code suggestions, irrespective of their deployment methods.

This strategy significantly simplifies enterprise management and abstracts machine learning away from the monolith. With future expansions including telemetry, embeddings API, and multi-region/customer-specific deployments, our goal is to provide a scalable, comprehensive AI solution for all GitLab users, regardless of their installation type.

[Model registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/ml/model_registry/index.html) is a feature that allows users to use GitLab to manage the machine learning models. While not solely focused on large language models, and currently more targeted at smaller model applications, which could be deployed in various ways: as a standalone library, a service, a pod, a cloud deployment, and so forth. For these user-deployed models, the ability to auto-configure an API that's accessible through the AI Gateway could be a significant feature.

### Unit Primitives

Unit Primitives are a fundamental part of our strategy for managing access to AI features through the AI Gateway. They represent the smallest unit of functionality that can be accessed and managed through the Gateway. This approach provides a more granular control over the functionalities exposed through the AI Gateway and simplifies the management of AI features. It also paves the way for future work on supporting user-deployed models and locally hosted models. From a business perspective, unit primitives are the smallest pieces that may be shuffled across various tiers or packaging models, providing flexibility and adaptability in our offerings.

In the initial iteration, we will support two primitives: Code Suggestions and Chat. The latter will encompass all Chat features in one primitive.

In the next iteration, we plan to decompose the Chat primitive into multiple primitives based on top-level tools. This work is dependent on the completion of the task to move classification into the AI Gateway.

The introduction of Unit Primitives will simplify the management of AI features and provide a more granular control over the functionalities exposed through the AI Gateway. This will also pave the way for future work on supporting user-deployed models and locally hosted models.

For more details on how to implement and integrate unit primitives, refer to the [Cloud Connector documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/cloud_connector/index.html).

## Other components in the AI stack

While AI Gateway centralizes _access_ to AI features and models, it interacts with other components to help users achieve their goals:

- Model registry: manage and deployment machine learning models
