## Why I'm at GitLab

I'm energized by the opportunity to be part of building something transformative. Our work has a meaningful impact for our customers, helping them accelerate their own innovation. We're not just building software - we're enabling organizations to transform how they work.
For me, a strong business model alone isn't enough - the people and environment I work with daily matter immensely. Great results come from great teams. I'm particularly proud of the teams we've built at GitLab. Our success isn't just measured in business metrics, but in how we grow together, challenge each other, and create an environment where everyone can do their best work.

## My Personal Values

1. **Results** - I am committed to driving business results and measuring success. This means setting clear & ambitious goals and developing systematic approaches to achieve them. I measure success not by the effort but by the impact we create.
1. **Resilience** - I believe that our greatest growth comes from how we handle adversity and navigate challenging situations. This means maintaining composure under pressure while being willing to engage in productive conflict when needed. I view constructive disagreement as a powerful tool for achieving better outcomes.
1. **Collaboration** - I believe that the best solutions come when we leverage diverse perspectives and work together. This means actively seeking input from others and engaging in constructive dialogue. I value creating an environment where people feel comfortable sharing their ideas and challenging assumptions with mutual respect & trust.

## My Super Powers - how you can get the best from me

1. **Execution** -  I excel at turning plans into reality and delivering results. I break down complex initiatives into actionable steps, establish clear metrics for success, and drive accountability in follow-through. Execution isn't about just getting things done â€“ it's about getting the right things done in the right way, with a focus on delivering business impact.
1. **Examination** - As an INTJ, I naturally gravitate toward dissecting complex problems and uncovering root causes. This manifests in developing frameworks for analysis and testing assumptions from multiple angles. My approach focuses on finding data-driven insights rather than relying on intuition alone.
1. **Decision Making** - This combines both my execution and examination strengths. The focus is on balancing thorough analysis with pragmatic action, particularly in ambiguous situations. This means weighing multiple factors, considering downstream effects/risks, and knowing when to gather more data versus when to move forward with the information at hand.

## My Weaknesses

1. **Curiosity** - I ask a lot of questions and like to drill into details. For efficiency I can go straight to the source. This is not a reflection of anything other than a desire to get the best information in the fastest way possible.
    - How to help me manage this: Understand that detailed questions come from a place of interest and learning. Feel free to redirect me through proper channels and ask clarifying questions if my direct inquiries create confusion.
1. **Drive** - My execution-focused nature means I often push myself and others at a relentless pace. While this drive helps deliver results, it can be intense and sometimes makes it challenging for others to keep up.
    - How to help me manage this: Open dialogue benefits everyone - having candid conversations about workload and pacing helps us find the right rhythm together. The more we communicate, the better we can balance results with sustainability.
1. **Directness** - I can be direct and to the point in communication. This is for efficiency, but I recognize it can sometimes come across as abrupt or lacking emotion, especially in written communication.
    - How to help me manage this: Let me know if you need more context or if my directness feels too sharp. I appreciate when people ask for clarification or request that I provide more background.

## My Expectations of Everyone

1. **Ownership** - Take responsibility for your work from start to finish. This means doing initial scoping before seeking input, coming prepared with first-pass proposals rather than open-ended questions, and showing that you've tried to solve problems before escalating them.
1. **Effort vs Impact** - Demonstrate good judgment in balancing perfectionism with pragmatism. Know when to dive deep and when good enough is good enough. Focus energy on work that moves the needle rather than polishing things that don't create meaningful value.
1. **Self-Awareness** - Know your strengths and weaknesses, understand your working style, and actively work on personal development. Understand how your style impacts others and team dynamics / collaboration.

## My Role

1. I am the VP of FP&A. FP&A acts as the stewards of the GitLab business model by driving interlocked financial and operating planning, identifying and unlocking sources of enterprise value, and delivering insights that inform business decisions.

## Communication Preferences

1. I am reachable and responsive on all modes of communication. My SLA is to respond or acknowledge Slack communications within a business day. Real-time and/or urgent communication is best via phone or text.
1. I appreciate quick acknowledgments on written communications - a simple emoji or "got it" helps me know things are received & moving forward.
1. I value frameworks and context in discussions - always share the reasoning behind your positions and decisions.
1. I do a good job of reviewing asynchronous documents and sharing my questions / feedback via Google comments. If there is time sensitivity Anita Mall can help to schedule review time on my calendar.
