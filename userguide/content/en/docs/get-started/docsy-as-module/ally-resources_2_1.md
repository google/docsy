## What is an ally?

A diversity, inclusion and belonging "ally" is someone who is willing to take action in support of another person, in order to remove barriers that impede that person from contributing their skills and talents in the workplace or community.

## How to be an ally

It is not required to be an ally to work at GitLab. At GitLab it is required to [be inclusive](/handbook/values/#diversity-inclusion). Being an ally goes a step beyond being inclusive to taking action to support marginalized groups. The first step in being an ally is self-educating. This is a page to list resources that GitLab team-members have found helpful in learning how to act as an ally.

### Acting as an Ally meansâ€¦

- Being an advocate for individuals and groups other than your own.
- Standing  up, even when you feel scared.
- Transfer ing the benefits of your privilege to those who lack it.
- Acknowledging that even though you feel pain, the conversation is not about you.
- Willing to own your mistakes and de-center yourself.
- Understanding that your education is up to you and no one else.
