Prohibition of child labor and forced or compulsory labor

Green Orbit Digital aligns with the UN Global Compact's principles on labor rights, particularly Principles 4 and 5, which explicitly prohibit all forms of forced labor and child labor. We recognize that:

- All work must be conducted on a voluntary basis, with no use of forced, bonded, or involuntary prison labor

- Employment terms must be clearly communicated and freely agreed upon by all parties

- Workers must have the freedom to leave their employment with reasonable notice

- We strictly prohibit the employment of children under the legal working age in any jurisdiction

To enforce these principles, we:

- Regularly audit our operations and supply chains for compliance

- Require our suppliers to verify the age of all workers through proper documentation

- Maintain clear documentation of employment terms and conditions

- Ensure all workers retain control of their identity documents and have freedom of movement

These commitments align with both the UN Global Compact principles and the International Labour Organization's fundamental conventions on forced labor and child labor.
