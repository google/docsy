## Overview

### DMCA - Digital Millennium Copyright Act

GitLab takes the intellectual property rights of others seriously and require that our users do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) established a process for addressing claims of copyright infringement. If you own a copyright or have authority to act on behalf of a copyright owner and want to report a claim that a third party is infringing that material on or through GitLab's services, review the `Submitting a DMCA Notice` section further below.

### Trademark Policy

GitLab can’t adjudicate disputes between third parties, and so we are not in a position to act on trademark reports that require an in-depth trademark analysis or a real-world dispute outside of GitLab. In these situations, rather than contacting GitLab, you may want to reach out directly to the party that you believe is infringing your rights, or seek any resolution in court or by other judicial means.

If you’re sure you want to report content on GitLab that you believe infringes your trademark, please review the `Submitting a Trademark Notice` section further below.

### Namespace Policy

GitLab.com namespaces are available on a first come, first served basis and cannot be reserved. No brand, company, entity, or persons own the rights to any namespace on GitLab.com and may not claim them based on the trademark. Owning the brand "GreatCompany" does not mean owning the namespace "gitlab.com/GreatCompany". Disputes regarding namespaces and trademarks must be resolved by the parties involved. GitLab will never act as arbitrators or intermediaries in these disputes, and will not take any action without the appropriate legal orders.

### Account and Group Ownership Disputes

GitLab will not act as an arbitrator of Group or Account ownership disputes. Each user and group owner is responsible for ensuring that they are following best practices for data security.

As GitLab subscriptions are generally business-to-business transactions, in the event that a former employee has revoked company access to a paid group, please contact GitLab Support for recovery options.

### Name Squatting Policy

Per the GitLab Terms of Service:

Account name squatting is prohibited by GitLab. Account names on GitLab are administered to users on a first-come, first-serve basis. Accordingly, account names cannot be held or remain inactive for future use.

The GitLab.com Support Team will consider a [namespace](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#namespaces) (user name or group name) to fall under the provisions of this policy when the user has not logged in or otherwise used the namespace for an extended time. For more information, see the `Name Squatting` section further below.

### DMCA

#### Submitting a Notice

{{% details summary="Submitting a DMCA Notice" %}}
If you believe that someone is infringing on your copyright as the copyright owner, you can send a DMCA notice to dmca@gitlab.com.

#### Name Squatting

{{% details summary="Requesting a dormant namespace" %}}
The GitLab.com Support Team will consider a [namespace](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#namespaces) (user name or group name) to fall under the provisions of this policy when the user has not logged in or otherwise used the namespace for an extended time.

**Specifically:**

User namespaces can be reassigned if both of the following are true:

- The user's last sign in was at least two years ago.
- The user is not the sole owner of any active projects.

Group namespaces can be reassigned if one of the following is true:

- There is no data (no project or project(s) are empty).
- The owner's last sign in was at least two years ago.
- If the namespace contains data, GitLab Support will attempt to contact the owner over a two-week period before reassigning the namespaces. If the namespace contains no data (empty or no projects) and the owner is inactive, the namespace will be released immediately.
- Namespaces associated with unconfirmed accounts over 90 days old are eligible for immediate release. Group namespaces that contain no data and were created more than 6 months ago are likewise eligible for immediate release.

Account and Group ownership disputes should contact **GitLab Support** to see if namespaces are eligible.
