### Operational Controls Affecting Energy for ISO 50001

ISO 50001 provides a framework for organizations to manage and improve their energy performance. The purpose of operational controls affecting energy is to ensure that energy usage is optimized, risks related to energy consumption are mitigated, and energy efficiency goals are achieved. These operational controls cover the processes, procedures, and practices necessary to monitor, measure, and optimize energy consumption while reducing waste and improving overall energy efficiency.

The following sections outline key operational controls affecting energy for compliance with ISO 50001, focusing on energy consumption, performance monitoring, and continual improvement.
