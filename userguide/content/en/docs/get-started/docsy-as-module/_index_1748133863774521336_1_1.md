## Overview

### Problem Statement

In the annual employee engagement and satisfaction survey, Marketing's lowest score was for career development within GitLab. Due to the team structure, hiring is made for specific roles and the team is kept as lean and efficient as possible. This makes mobility more difficult.

### Proposed Solution

Create a program for learning and development based on core competencies in the main areas all marketers should have. Working with the L&D team and resources available (ie. LinkedIn Learning) Marketing will curate a program with the goal of developing team members based on these competencies and make them eligible to move into internal roles.
