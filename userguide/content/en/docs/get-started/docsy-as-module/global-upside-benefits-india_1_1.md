  - EPF: 12%, EPS: None

Salary Ceiling: EPF: Mandatory contribution remains up to a monthly salary ceiling of INR15,000

### Life Insurance

Most companies in India do not offer life insurance as part of the benefits package. Global Upside, similarly, does not offer a life insurance plan to GitLab team members. Most workers in India will typically get their own life insurance which can be portable throughout their lifetime.

### Meal Vouchers

Sodexo Meal Cards are an optional benefit. These Meal Cards work like a Debit Card, which can be used at any outlet selling food items and non-alcoholic beverages that accept card payments. If you would like purchase these a deduction from salary will be made each month. All team members are given the option to opt-in for Sodexo cards during the pre-onboarding process managed by the CES (Candidate Experience Specialist) team.

### Gratuity

Gratuity is a statutory offering in India per The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 which is offered through Global Upside based on the Global Upside hire date.

### Loyalty Bonus Scheme

GitLab has implemented a private loyalty bonus scheme since some team members have been contracted through different employment types as we have worked through country conversion processes. Therefore, the GitLab Loyalty Bonus Scheme will supplement gratuity based on the GitLab hire date vs the PEO hire date.

**Elibility:** One can only claim Loyalty Bonus after retirement or resign from the service after completing 5 years of continuous service.

**Forfeiture of Loyalty Bonus:** The full amount of Loyalty Bonus can be forfeited if a team member’s services have been terminated due to: a) Riotous or disorderly conduct or any other violent act; b) Committing an offence involving moral turpitude.

**Calculation of Loyalty Bonus:**

Loyalty Bonus Amount =  Gratuity Calculation using GitLab Hire Date + Gratuity Calculation using PEO Hire Date

`The duration for Gratuity Calculation using GitLab Hire Date is the duration prior to the hire date of the PEO`

**Note:** The Loyalty Bonus Amount is provided by GitLab to the team members. Any amount which GitLab will pay as Loyalty Bonus would be fully taxable for the team members.

**Total Rewards Responsibilities:**

- Maintain Gratuity Calculation sheet
- Update the sheet every month
- Send an email to Accounts team on or before 5th of every month to calculate the accruals.
