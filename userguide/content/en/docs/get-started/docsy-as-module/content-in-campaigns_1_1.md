## Overview

{: #overview .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

This page documents ways in which content is leveraged in campaigns, including in-house created content, analyst relations content, and downloadable competitive content.

In an effort to best engage our technical audience, we are pursuing an **ungated content journey** that leverages Pathfactory tracks, rather than gated landing pages. This allows viewers to preview content before signing up to view in its entirety. We have flexibility about when and how the forms display, and will test to deliver the best experience with proven results. This process will also be more efficient to launch new content so time can be focused on how to leverage the content in campaigns.

The epic code in each section below outlines the necessary issues to open in order to "check off" the list of action items to launch a new piece of content. *While this page exists within the Campaigns Team handbook page, it is meant to be contributed to by all teams in marketing. If you see an updated needed, please submit an MR and assign to `@aoetama`.*

### Types of content in campaigns

{: #content-types .gitlab-orange}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
- **Content for use in marketing campaigns:** we leverage the content in our marketing channels (website, email nurture, paid digital, organic social, etc.)
  - [Internal GitLab-created content](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/content-in-campaigns#internal-content): We created and developed the content in house
  - [External content (i.e. Analyst Relations)](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/content-in-campaigns#external-content): We have bought the rights to use the content from an external vendor (analysts or publishers, for example) or received the content from a partner
  - [On-Demand Webcasts](/handbook/marketing/virtual-events/webcasts/)
- **[Content syndication](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#content-syndication)** (under Digital Marketing): We have promoted our content through a third-party vendor, but do not drive people back to our website. In these cases, we often have given them the resource to make available for download to their audience, and receive the leads to be uploaded.

## How to pick content for campaigns

{: #picking-content-for-campaigns .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
**Search the entire Pathfactory Content Library**

https://gitlab.lookbookhq.com/authoring/content-library/content

Filter by one or multiple of the following:

- Topic
- Content Type
- Funnel Stage
- GTM Motion (Business Unit in Pathfactory)
- Language

**View reports to see what works**

- **Key metric to analyze: Engagement Time**
  - *"Why not total views?"* Engagement time is a better indicator of content effectiveness than views, which can be a self-fulfilling prophesy; the more views, the more it is used, the more it continues to climb in comparison to other content.

## Internally-Created Content (i.e. eBooks, Guides)

{: #internal-content .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
The below process should be used for all new content (ebooks, guides, whitepapers, etc.). Creating the epic and related issues is the responsibility of the **Campaign Manager** to make sure that when the content is ready, the teams involved in putting into Pathfactory (MOps) and the teams involved in activating (Campaigns, Digital, ABM) are able to take action immediately.

## Externally-Created Content (i.e. Analyst Relations)

{: #external-content .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
External content can be sourced from Analyst Relations, partners, and other vendors with whom we work. Some examples would be vendor comparisons (i.e. Gartner/Forrester) or industry/market analyses (i.e. DevOps Institute).

When a GitLab team member (i.e. AR) is evaluating a potential content for sponsorship, they are responsible for working with the [GTM Motion teams](/handbook/marketing/plan-fy22/#core-teams) to discuss how to leverage the content and if it makes sense for us to sponsor. They can do so by opening a [decision matrix issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new?issuable_template=decision-tree-matrix) (see step by step process below). The campaign manager will evaluate the decision matrix inputs and give the final go/no go on sponsorship decision. If the decision is to sponsor the external content, the campaign manager will create the content activation epic and associated issues to request work of all relevant teams (outlined below to try to make it efficient, comprehensive, and repeatable!).

All external content should be planned in advance of purchase with `at least a 30 business day time to launch date`. This allows time to plan activation into existing and future integrated campaigns and GTM Motions.

### The decision matrix

The purpose of the decision matrix is to gather cross-functional feedback whether a new analyst report will be a lucrative investment to solidify GitLab's positioning in the market. It will also outline the campaigns and persona it is aligned to as well as the channels where it will be activated.

#### Step by step decision matrix process

1. **Analyst relations** will open a [decision matrix issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new?issuable_template=decision-tree-matrix) and assign to relevant Campaign Manager.
1. **Campaign Manager** to tag relevant product marketing, sdr enablement, and field enablement counterparts on the decision matrix issue and comment to submit their inputs by agreed upon SLA date. | `SLA: 1 Business Day`
1. **Product Marketing,SDR Enablement, Field Enablement** to fill out their portions for relevant channels, campaign, persona. Tag relevant technical counterparts for input. | `SLA: 3 Business Days`
1. **Campaign Manager** fills out the suggested channel for promotion and makes the go/no go decision on sponsorship, tagging analyst relations |  `SLA: 3 Business Day`

**Decision Matrix end to end decision timeline (SLA): 7 Business days**

## Adding new content to the Resources page

{: #add-to-resources-page .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**[Video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8NZV75H7lw) of adding a resource to https://about.gitlab.com/resources/ by using the CMS (Contentful).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8NZV75H7lw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Step by step instructions below**

1. Go to the [Resources page](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/xz1dnu24egyd/entries/5sF9ZMv4xAffzAKEnQGozh?focusedField=title) entry in Contentful
1. Click on the "Browse all resources" section of page content
1. Scroll waaaaay to the bottom and select + Add Content -> Card
1. From here, it might be helpful to open an existing card and make sure the same fields are filled out, but the gist is:

   - the Title goes in both `Internal Name` and `Title`
   - the Language goes in `Subtitle`
   - the Teaser goes in `Description`
   - the Topics go in `List` (hit enter after each topic)
   - the Solutions go in `Pills` (hit enter after each topic)
   - the Type of resource goes in `Icon Name`
   - the URL goes in `Card Link`

Publish that card, drag it to the top of the list if you want it to appear first, and publish that section too!

If you want to edit other parts of the page the process is similar, just follow the existing pattern of the other cards! The only section to watch out for is the Featured resource - the one you want to feature has to be first in that list, and has to have an image.

*Note: For ungated journeys, the URL drives to the PF asset/track, instead of a landing page.*

## How to extend analyst assets

{: #extend-analyst-assets .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
At times, we will extend the rights to an asset if it is heavily used by sales or performing in campaigns. In that case the decision is indicated in the [Expiration Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new?issuable_template=campaigns-expire-analyst).

Follow the steps outlined [in the Pathfactory Content Library Handbook](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory/content-library/#replacing-or-updating-the-verson-of-an-asset-after-initial-upload).

## How to retire analyst assets when they expire

{: #retire-analyst-assets .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
An [Expiration Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new?issuable_template=campaigns-expire-analyst) will be opened by the Campaign Manager DRI for each analyst asset, and related to the overarching Epic (with due date for when the asset is set to expire). When the decision is made to expire the asset, the teams involved will check off their respective action items in the issue.

### Retire Marketo landing page

{: #retire-marketo-page}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
**First you will remove the form from the page and add a "no longer available" message**

- In the Marketo program, click "edit" on the Registration Page
- On right rail under "Variables" (below "Elements"), find `2column Visibility` and switch to "Hidden"
- On right rail under "Variables" (below "Elements"), find `2column Sidebar` and switch to "No Sidebar"
- On right rail under "Variables" (below "Elements"), find `flex1 Visibility` and switch to "Visible"
- In flex1 section, double-click then click to edit in HTML > add the code below into the section and save
- Approve Landing Page and test live. You should no longer be able to see the form or paragraph text, and only see the notice about resource no longer being available.

```html
<h1>This resource is no longer available.</h1>
<p>Thank you for your interest in this resource, but it is no longer available for download. <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/analysts/" target="_blank" id="">Click here to visit our industry analysts page to view other reports and best practices!</a></p>
```

### Remove from Intelligent Nurture

{: #remove-intelligent-nurture}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
Please follow the process outlined in the [Emails/Nurture Handbook](/handbook/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/emails-nurture).

### Remove from Pathfactory

{: #remove-pathfactory}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
Please follow the process outlined in the [Pathfactory Handbook](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory/content-library/#removing-an-asset-from-the-library).

### Marketo automation and setup for gated landing page

{: #steps-gated-landing-pages}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
**!!! REMINDER: We are using ungated content journeys via Pathfactory. This process should only be used for specific scenarios, and used sparingly.**

[Watch the video tutorial >](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrmDCZPh1nw)

:exclamation: Dependencies: delivery of final asset, completion of final landing page copy, and final asset added to pathfactory and placed in a track must be complete before setting up the Marketo program.

**The TL;DR of what you'll do:**

- Create Marketo program, tokens, and SFDC campaign sync
- Edit registration page and thank you page URLs
- Edit and Activate smart campaign(s)
- Update SFDC campaign
- Test live registration page and flows
- Add new content to the Resources page (separate issue)

#### Create Marketo program, tokens, and SFDC campaign sync

{: #steps-gated-mkto-sfdc}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
- Clone the [Marketo Gated Content Template](https://app-ab13.marketo.com/#PG5111A1) and name new program using naming convention (YYYY_Type_AssetName, i.e. 2020_report_GarnterVOC_ARO)
- Create SFDC program (Program Summary > `Salesforce campaign sync` > click "not set" and choose "Create New" from dropdown) - leave the name as auto-populates, and add the epic url to the description and "Save"
- Update Marketo tokens (Program Summary > "My Tokens" tab)
  - `{{my.bullet1}}` - bullet copy with approved [character limits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKVIZGbbOLoR5BdCqXqCQ40qJlQNif9waTiHc8yWggQ/edit#gid=905304679)
  - `{{my.bullet2}}` - bullet copy with approved [character limits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKVIZGbbOLoR5BdCqXqCQ40qJlQNif9waTiHc8yWggQ/edit#gid=905304679)
  - `{{my.bullet3}}` - bullet copy with approved [character limits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKVIZGbbOLoR5BdCqXqCQ40qJlQNif9waTiHc8yWggQ/edit#gid=905304679)
  - `{{my.bullet4}}` - bullet copy with approved [character limits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKVIZGbbOLoR5BdCqXqCQ40qJlQNif9waTiHc8yWggQ/edit#gid=905304679)
  - `{{my.contentDescription}}`    - 2-3 sentences with approved [character limits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKVIZGbbOLoR5BdCqXqCQ40qJlQNif9waTiHc8yWggQ/edit#gid=905304679), this will show up in page previews on social and be used in Pathfactory description.
  - `{{my.contentDownloadURL}}` - skip updating in initial registration page setup (update during on-demand switch), Pathfactory link WITHOUT the `https://` NOR the email tracking part (`lb_email=`)
    - Example of correct link to include: `learn.gitlab.com/gartner-voc-aro/gartner-voc-aro` - the code in the Marketo template assets will create the URL `https://learn.gitlab.com/gartner-voc-aro/gartner-voc-aro?lb_email={{lead.email address}}&{{my.utm}}`
    - Note that both parts of this url include custom URL slugs which should be incorporated into all pathfactory links for simplicity of tracking paramaeters

  - `{{my.contentType}}`    - content type to display to viewer (throughout landing page, emails, interesting moments, etc.)
  - `{{my.contentTypeSFDC}}` - pick from following list (critical to avoid Marketo > SFDC sync errors): whitepaper, report, video, eBook, general

- Click to `01 Downloaded Content` smart campaign
- Click on `Smart List`
- Confirm that the first trigger for `Fills out Form` is set to `Form Name` is any, `Web Page` is (the name of your landing page). This should already be set properly.
- the second trigger for `Fills out Form` should be set to `Form Name` is "Form 2074: PF General". In `Referrer` contains, enter the Pathfactory asset name slug. For example `guide-to-devops`.
- the third trigger for `Fills out Form` should be set to `Form Name` is "Pathfactory Webhook". In `Referrer` contains, enter the Pathfactory asset name slug. For example `guide-to-devops`.
- Filter 1 - `Filled Out Form` should already be set properly. This will be `Form Name` is any. `Web Page` is (the name of your landing page).
- Filter 2 - `Filled Out Form` should be set to `Form Name` is "Form 2074: PF General". In `Referrer` contains, enter the Pathfactory asset name slug. For example `guide-to-devops`.
- Filter 3 - `Filled out Form` should be set to `Form Name` is "Pathfactory Webhook". In `Referrer` contains, enter the Pathfactory asset name slug. For example `guide-to-devops`. `Date of Activity` should already be set to in the past 1 hour.

If your content falls into this category, no updates are necessary. Any other content types should be updated with the threshold outlined under [Pathfactory Scoring](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory/#pathfactory-scoring). For example, if you are creating an analyst report, you will enter 120 instead of 60.
- Advanced filters will be set to `1 or 2 or (3 and 4)`
- Flow: it's all set! For your first few, feel free to review the flows (but they are all using tokens, so it should be ready to go automatically)
- Schedule tab: click "Activate" (note: the settings should be that "each person can run through the flow once every 7 days" - this is to avoid bots resubmitting repeatedly)

#### Update SFDC campaign

## Potential backup process

{: #retire-marketo-page .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
To be completed by the content owner if Pathfactory access is granted. If no access, please open an issue in Campaigns team based on epic category above.

**Add to /downloads/ repository** (only available and recommended for assets under 2 MB size)

*The purpose of this step is to make it possible to flip the autoresponder if Pathfactory were to have an outtage, at which point, we would still have the PDF version available in Marketo for a quick turnaround.*

1. Save the pdf to your computer with naming convention `[asset-type]-short-name-asset`, ex: `ebook-agile-delivery-models`
1. Navigate to the (de-indexed) [`resource/download`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/tree/master/sites/uncategorized/source/resources) directory
1. Where it says `www-gitlab-com / sites / marketing / source / resources / +`, click the plus drop down and select "Upload File"
1. Upload the file you've saved to your computer with the naming convention above
1. For commit message, add `Upload [Asset Type]: [Asset Name]`, check box for "create new merge request", name your merge request, and click "Upload file"
1. Add description to MR, complete the author checklist, assign to `@aoetama` and click "Submit Merge Request"
1. In your Marketo program, for the `pdfVersion` My Token, add the naming convention above which will be available when the MR is merged. (the token should look like `https://about.gitlab.com/resources/downloads/add-file-name-here.pdf`)
