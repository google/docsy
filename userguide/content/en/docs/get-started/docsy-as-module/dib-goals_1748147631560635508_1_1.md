In this page you will find the current Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Goals for GitLab. These will be updated on a quarterly basis to ensure they remain current. We will keep a list of completed or non-current goals at the bottom with a retention of 12 months. If you would like to see the history of goals going further back, you can view the evolution of the page in GitLab.

## Current Goals

### Geographic Diversity (Team Member representation outside of NORAM)

We do not currently have a company wide goal for Geographic Diversity and this will remain in place for FY'23. Instead we will focus on increasing Director+ representation outside of the United States as team member representation is currently outpacing leadership representation. It would not prove advantageous to take a goal to contiue to increase team members external to the United States without first focusing on increasing our leadership population external to the United States. In FY24, we will reevaluate the need for director level+ representation goals outside of the United States.

**Problem Statement & Data:**

What is a timeline to create a US leadership KPI and/or OKR?

**Hypothesis:**

- Hiring occurs predominantly in US.
- Leadership is predominantly US Centric
- We are not currently hiring in enough countries

**Data:**

**Engineering Data: Representation in US vs. External to US**

1. Breakdown by levels showed that there are proportionate # of TMs at both the IC and Manager levels when comparing US to Non-US representation.
    - Engineering: US: 30.2% Non-US: 69.8%

**Results:**

1. Based on the data provided on both the current breakdown of TMs, levels and regions for Engineering, we do not recommend creating an additional goal around increased geographic representation.

### Global Representation of URGs

## Past Goals

Currently no past goals to attribute here

**Due to data and or legal limitations, this is not an exhaustive list of all of our underrepresented groups. Those with disabilities, those that identify as LGBTQIA+, etc. who choose not to disclose or underrepresented ethnicities outside of the US.

The DIB Team is actively working on finding data sets outside the US and inclusion metrics for underrepresented groups we cannot report on as team member representation.
