## Support Operations data requests

The Support Readiness team oversees data requests aimed at analyzing various support activities. This includes evaluating Zendesk tickets (such as volumes and trends), assessing ticket metrics (like handle times and response times), and analyzing other key support-related data.

### Support team member data request

Data requests from Support team members can be submitted by filing a Support Team Meta issue, using the [Data Request issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Data%20Request.md).

### Non-support team member data request

Data requests from non-support team members should initially be directed to the [WIP dashboard](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/explore/dashboard/EEE2BA02D87C93CA81B1B8B004200CC3218DB3CCBF174516A9824FA79EBABB63/tab/21320512) where applicable.

_Note:_  The WIP Dashboard contains SAFE data and may not be accessible by default to all team members. In such cases, the dashboard must be manually shared with the requester.

If the dashboard doesn't fulfill the needs of the request, a Support Team Meta issue should be created using the [Data Request issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Data%20Request.md).
