## What are Zendesk triggers?

As per [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408822236058-About-triggers-and-how-they-work):

> Triggers are business rules you define that run immediately after tickets are created or updated. For example, a trigger can be used to notify the customer when a ticket has been opened. Another can be created to then notify the customer when the ticket is solved.

## Trigger categories

As per [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408834781594-Creating-categories-to-organize-ticket-triggers):

> Ticket trigger categories allow you to visually group ticket triggers for easier organization and management.
