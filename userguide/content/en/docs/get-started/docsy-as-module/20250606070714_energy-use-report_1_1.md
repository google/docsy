### Creating Connections Between Databases

- Relation Properties: Use relations to link relevant items across databases. For example:

- Formula Properties: Use formulas to calculate totals, percentages, or to flag overdue actions (e.g. “Energy Savings” formula property in Energy Efficiency Measures could calculate cumulative savings).

### Database Views

To help with navigation, create custom views for each section:

- Table View for detailed breakdowns of each section (e.g., Energy Consumption, Risk & Opportunity).

- Board View for tracking the status of Energy Initiatives or Recommendations.

- Calendar View for deadlines, reporting periods, and action timelines (e.g., implementation deadlines for energy-saving projects).

- Gallery View for showcasing relevant appendices or documents with descriptions.
