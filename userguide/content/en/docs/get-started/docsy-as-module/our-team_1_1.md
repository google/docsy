title: Our L&D Team
---

While our team loves making learning and development content for the rest of the organization, we also love learning and growing ourselves. This page is meant to serve as a resource for the L&D team to explore, learn, and grow. We encourage all L&D Team Members to add to this page as you find additional resources.

The content should be accessible at no cost but anything requiring payment [can be reimbursed following the GitLab Growth and Development policy](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development).

## New Learning and Development Team Members

All new Learning and Development (L&D) team members complete our [team onboarding issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/new-learning-and-development-team-member.md) in addition to the company onboarding issue to get more familiarized with our team and L&D at GitLab.
