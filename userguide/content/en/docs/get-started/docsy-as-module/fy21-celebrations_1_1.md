### 2020 Ops Sub-department Year End Holiday Celebration

To celebrate the holiday season and recognize the many incredible things we have accomplished this year, we will be organizing a combination of swag and virtual events within the Ops Sub-Dept.

The e-group has allocated a $45 per person budget which engineering managers are responsible for spending based on their number of direct reports.
Expenses against the $45/person target can be submitted for reimbursement via Expensify.  Expenses should be incurred in December or January so they donâ€™t roll over into FY22.

      1. Brought Alert Management from planned to minimal in one milestone

1. A significant increase in MRs.  We merged 405 MRs, a 38% increase over the previous all time high of 292!

These are impressive results and we will take a moment to celebrate everyone's hard work contributing to them.
