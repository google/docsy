Dev Pulse changes are classified as ad-hoc. Once changes are merged into the default branch, they will be live.

These also usually involve changes to other components we manage.

## Making changes

Making the changes would be done by modifying the files within the project. You should also do this in a way that creates a MR. Said MR should always be peer reviewed before merging (the MR should enforce this).
