## Business Goal

1. Fix key current pain points in trainings. Specifically:
   1. Inefficiency
      1. Lack of clarity on training ownership
      1. Duplication in training content
   1. A sub-optimal user experience
      1. Need greater clarity on which part of the training is for what and who
1. Determine ongoing plan, processes, and ownership for future training coordination

## Exit Criteria

### Update /Learn

1. Inventory existing training programs to establish a SSoT ==> Complete, established in [GitLab Learn](https://about.gitlab.com/learn/)
1. Update https://about.gitlab.com/learn/ to capture SSoT and provide more clarity on which training is for what ==> Complete

### Create future coordination processes and plan

1. Document in the Handbook a process that DRIs working on learning content will follow to keep [GitLab Learn](https://about.gitlab.com/learn/)up-to-date, to ensure it remains the SSOT of GitLab-produced learning content. This will include existing content and planned content. ==> Complete, documented and established #gitlab-learn-updates Slack channel for reminders to update and x-team communications.
