## Foundations Specialty

In addition to embedding in [groups](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy) that focus on a specific product area, we also have a Foundations team that works on building a cohesive and consistent user experience across platform experiences like navigation, both visually and functionally. You’ll be responsible for leading the direction of the experience design, visual style, and technical tooling of the GitLab product. You’ll act as a centralized resource, helping to triage large-scale experience problems as the need arises.

You’ll spend your time collaborating with a [cross-functional team](http://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#ecosystem-group), implementing our [design system](https://design.gitlab.com/), building comprehensive accessibility standards into our workflows, and defining guidelines and best practices that will inform how teams are designing and building products. A breakdown of the vision you’ll be helping to deliver within the UX Foundation category can be found on our [product direction page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/manage/foundations/).

## UX Paper Cuts Specialty

The UX Paper Cuts team is responsible for identifying and fixing small, impactful usability issues in the GitLab product. Like the Foundations team, UX Paper Cuts doesn't work within a specific product area, but across the product as a whole, identifying issues and creating merge requests to continually [improve the user experience](https://papercuts.gitlab.com/). You'll also spend your time helping to implement and evolve the design system and GitLab UI and assist in burning down backlogs of known UI and usability problems. By focusing on small details, you'll help create a more polished and user-friendly interface, leading to increased user satisfaction, engagement, and ultimately a more successful product.

### UX Paper Cuts Responsibilities

Everything in the various levels of product designer roles, plus:

- **Intermediate development skills** We work primarily with Vue, Rails, and SCSS, so designers should be comfortable updating, building, and reviewing code within those frameworks.
- **Advanced Git knowledge** Since we spend most of our time working in merge requests, designers should be comfortable using Git effectively.
- **Creation and management of feature flags** Know when to use feature flags, how to create them, and montitor their progress and potential feedback.
- **Familiarity with unit testing** The ability to fix, update, and write RSpec and Jest tests.

## Hiring Process

<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJxw-O4POyU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>

Candidates for this position can expect the hiring process to follow the order below, although it can change depending on calendar availability. Please keep in mind that candidates can be declined from the position at any stage of the process. To learn more about someone who is conducting your interview, you can find their job title on our [team page](/handbook/company/team/).

- Selected candidates will be invited to schedule a 30-minute [screening call](http://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/interviewing/#screening-call) with a member of our hiring team. In this call, we will discuss your experience, understand what you are looking for in a product design role, talk about your work and approach to product design, discuss your compensation expectations and reasons why you want to join GitLab, and answer any questions you have.
- Next, if a candidate successfully passes the screening call, they will have two 1-hour interviews: One with a product designer and another with the hiring product design manager.
  - During these interviews you'll be asked several situational questions to help us learn how you have responded or would respond in certain scenarios.
  - You should be prepared to discuss your design and research process, details about how you collaborate, and how you approach your role.
  - You'll also have an opportunity to talk through a [case study](/job-families/product/product-designer/#case-studies) in your portfolio. We'll look for you to walk through a project so we can understand your process, approach, and philosophy to design, the size and structure of the team you were a part of, the goals of the project, your low-fidelity design work, your high-fidelity design skills, how you approached research, how you synthesized research data to inform design decisions, what design standards and guidelines you worked within, and how you collaborated with a wider team. We are looking for you to give some real insight into a problem you solved, ideally in a project with similar challenges, goals, or context to the type of work you’ll find in the [stage group](http://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages) you're interviewing for. Be prepared to discuss your project with your interviewer throughout your walk through. You can expect to spend about 30 minutes discussing your case study.
  - Towards the end of each interview, you'll be given some time to ask questions.
- If you successfully pass the previous interviews, you'll meet with a senior manager of product design for a 50-minute interview. This interview will focus on assessing your research, strategy, and design skills. The interviewer will want to understand how you have incorporated research into your work and get a feel for your understanding of the fundamentals of research and UX methodology. Be prepared to answer questions around the soft skills product designers need, and be prepared to talk to the interviewer about how you apply these skills in the real world.
- The final interview will be with a product manager and engineering manager. They'll focus on your ability to collaborate with product and engineering teams and determine how well your skills align with the needs of a specific stage group.
- Successful candidates will subsequently be made an offer via a video call or phone call.

### Hiring process for UX Paper Cuts Specialty

The UX Paper Cuts speciality has an emphasis on basic coding skills as the role involves making changes to the product by creating, reviewing, and merging MRs. The final interview will be with a member of the UX Paper Cuts team and will focus on discussing the technical exercise you'll receive a couple of days prior to the scheduled call. The technical exercise is brief and to be completed in advance. It's an opportunity to learn your comfort and capability in making small frontend changes. This final interview and exercise replaces the product manager and engineering manager mentioned above.

### Preparing for your interviews

#### Case studies

Here are some helpful tips for when you are sharing a case study:

- A formal presentation is not required but it is helpful to bring your materials together. We recommend not sharing entire design files as it can be difficult for an interviewer to follow along.
- Clearly outlined user and business problems that you were solving and how you learned about them.
- What your role was (for example, who did you work with and what was your responsibility).
- The details of the design process (polished visuals are fine but you may want to include the sketches, wireframes, prototypes, or the ideas that didn’t make it).
- The result of your work (learnings, successfully achieved goals, impact on key metrics).

### Internal candidates

The hiring process for internal candidates may be slightly adjusted from the above, but in general the goal is still to evaluate the best fit for the role. Interview questions may be adapted to gauge interest and skills in specific areas the team would like to grow, or about specific team responsibilities. A case study review is not necessary; instead, consider current or previous work assignments and experience in light of the position.

Additional details about our process can be found on our [hiring page](http://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/).
