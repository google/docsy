## OS Open Zoomstack Masterclass

This workshop acts as a nice intro to OS Open Zoomstack, specifically the vector tiles.
We will create a custom map style, add a custom dataset and then create a scrolling story map which we will host on GitHub Pages.

You can see an example of the map we'll be creating [here](https://charleyglynn.github.io/brewdog-map/).

## Whatâ€™s included?

**Workbook** - This contains an illustrated step-by-step guide for you to work through at your own pace. You may find it more convenient to print this out.
This is all you will need - all the data and code required is hosted online already.

## Prerequisites

You will need a GitHub account that is GitHub Pages enabled.
We will also be using Maputnik.
