## **Expansion Journey: Premium to Ultimate Up-tier**

## **Purpose**

Create the foundational customer journey to describe our customer *experience* with the GitLab teams expanding into Ultimate from awareness, through purchase and onboarding, to adoption and renewal for this tier of customer. 

While there are many micro journeys that were created by teams that describe a moment in the journey or a product interface user experience, the holistic pre- through post-sales journey currently does not exist.

Essential to this research is not only understanding what the journey looks like for customers where Ultimate is the right fit, but also understanding where Ultimate tier is not a fit and why.
