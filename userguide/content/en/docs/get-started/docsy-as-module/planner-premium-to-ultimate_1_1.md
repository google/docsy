#### **Target segments and key messages for each**  {#target-segments}

Emphasis on large due to the relation to verticals + regulated industries, but all should be included

**ENT:** Do more with less when you expand your benefits from using GitLab by adding Security capabilities of GitLab Ultimate all within the DevOps platform your teams already know and love. Bring security scanning to the developer's existing workflows to empower them to find and fix vulnerabilities, while at the same time simplifying your tool set and eliminating integration efforts. Unify teams to work more efficiently and collaboratively through a shared platform so you can deliver business value faster while staying secure and compliant.

**MM:** Don't let security slow you down. Improve efficiencies, collaboration, and eliminate bottlenecks by enabling security capabilities on your existing GitLab Platform. Spend time on planned work instead of maintaining and integrating tools. Get expertise and support that assures you can meet your strategic goals along the way.

**SMB:** Go fast, go safely, and do it easily by using even more of the GitLab platform. Take your continuous integration up a notch by seamlessly adding security scanning and collecting the vulnerabilities all in one easy-to-use place. You don't have to be a security expert to see your risks and where to resolve them. Start right before inefficiencies get in the way of scaling out successfully.

**PubSec:**  Reap the full rewards of the platform you are already using. Upgrade to Ultimate to manage risk from security and regulatory compliance by identifying vulnerabilities and compliance issues before the code ever leaves the developer's hands. Stop worrying about audits!

#### **Sales teams** {#sales-teams}

 SAEs, Account managers, and CSMs

#### **Pipeline goal**  {#pipeline-goal}

See [this section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AdF47jJpE9aKvL2g5fs6kHK0hqPBCsI-PNDTGxcWy2o/edit#heading=h.oxgl92c3g1fw) in the working doc

#### **Target personas** {#target-personas}

Budget and influence are key for this play, so our basic assumption is that upleveling to someone’s boss isn’t going to be enough - people need to reach out to additional business units, namely security, and bring in “fresh” teams and opportunities within existing accounts. Additionally, we need to enable and equip current premium customers and their teams to be more “active champions” and essentially show them the light that is the value of Ultimate. (Think risk! and protecting the business)

* **Economic buyers:**
  * CISO or Security Manager, VP of Security, Director of Security, VP of IT or CTO, App/Dev Director
* **Technical influencers:**
  * Chief Architect, App Dev Manager, DevOps lead

#### **Target verticals**  {#target-verticals}

With the heavy tie to security for value with Ultimate, all regulated industries should be a focal point

* Healthcare, government, finance, telecom

#### **Partner routes to market**  {#partner-routes-to-market}

* Reseller?
* MSP?
* GSI?
* Disti?

#### **Elevator pitch**  {#elevator-pitch}

Get maximum benefits from using GitLab by adding Security capabilities of Ultimate all within the DevOps platform your teams already know and love. Bring security scanning to the developer's existing workflows to empower them to find and fix vulnerabilities, while at the same time simplifying your tool set and eliminating integration efforts. Unify teams to work more efficiently and collaboratively through a shared platform so you can deliver business value faster while staying secure and compliant.

#### **Value proposition** {#value-proposition}

1) Stop choosing between velocity and risk — test all of your code, on every commit, automatically, i.e. not just critical apps or periodic scans - without costly tool chain integrations.

2) Better leverage your scarce security resources by putting app sec tools, that are meant for the developer, into the hands of the developer, so they remediate more and earlier.

3) Improve visibility while at the same time reducing friction between processes and tools used by dev and app sec teams.

Other thoughts/notes:

* Everything you get in Premium as well as free guest users, 50,000 compute minutes, and more…
* GitLab Ultimate provides the single tool DevOps teams need to find and fix vulnerabilities in application code and its environments and to manage their risk from detection through remediation.
* GitLab empowers and unites developers and security pros alike using repeatable, defensible processes that automate security and compliance policies from development through production.

#### **Partner value proposition**  {#partner-value-proposition}

Partners will appreciate the size of the Ultimate deals as well as the stickiness that use of its capabilities provides. Security is an ideal candidate for professional services assistance as well. Become an expert in end-to-end DevSecOps through a platform already used and loved by many.

#### **GitLab capabilities featured**  {#gitlab-capabilities-featured}

Which GitLab stages/feature make up this sales play:

* Create, Verify, Release, Secure, Govern

**Key capabilities in Ultimate center around security, compliance, insights/analytics, and releasing better + faster**

* Compliance dashboard - high level view of project compliance status and merge request approvers
* Release analytics- An aggregated view of all release metrics for each of the projects associated to a group.
* Auto rollback- Automatic rollback to the last successful deployment.
* DORA 4 metrics (Deployment frequency available now, lead time scheduled to ship in 13.11), the remaining two are on the roadmap later this year)
* Static Application Security Testing - check for potential security issues by evaluating static code but with Ultimate, see the results of the scans directly in the MR pipeline and also in the Security Dashboard, alongside all of the additional scans below that come with Ultimate:
  * Dynamic Application Security Testing - analyze review applications to identify potential security issues on running web applications before deployment
  * Secrets Detection - avoid exposing secrets and credentials for potential exploit.
  * Dependency Scanning - evaluate third-party dependencies to identify potential security issues.
  * Container Scanning - analyze Docker images and check for potential security issues.
  * License Compliance - identify the presence of new software licenses included in your project and track project dependencies. Approve or deny the inclusion of a specific license.
  * Coverage-guided Fuzz testing API Fuzz testing - surface security and logic flaws not identified as known vulnerabilities.
* Security Dashboard - visualize security status for projects.
* Vulnerability Management
* Security Approvals in Merge Requests

Ultimate also includes priority support (4 business hour support), upgrade assistance, and a Customer Success Manager who will work with you to achieve your strategic objectives and gain maximum value from your investment in GitLab.

#### **Which combination delivers the overall outcome to a customer**  {#which-combination-delivers-the-overall-outcome-to-a-customer}

Identifying customers who are already using GitLab Premium and leveraging us for SCM and CI capabilities, as well as have a need for reporting, insights, analytics, and security. We want to understand their challenges and primary objectives. Often they have started shifting security left but struggling to scale across all projects. Bonus points if they’re trying to extend their automation or start automating their deployments and have a need for modern CD with compliance. We want to understand what they need first, and then plug in what value we can provide in Ultimate among the major themes: Security, compliance, releasing safely and efficiently (not trading velocity for risk or quality and having control over deployments/environments), end-to-end visibility and insights, and collaboration that unifies teams.

* A good example to portray the power of CD/Security in Ultimate: combining Review Apps and DAST. Only GitLab can deliver DAST results to the developer within their pipeline before the code is merged. We do so by running the dynamic scan against the review app. Ensuring your apps are secure and compliant doesn’t stop once the code has been shipped. GitLab Ultimate also provides container security for runtime monitoring and protection.

#### **Where should you land vs expand?**  {#where-should-you-land-vs-expand}

Land SCM/CI and Expand CD/Security

* CD: Ultimate is ideal for projects with executive visibility while managing priorities, security, risk, and compliance.
* Security: With Ultimate you can achieve advanced DevOps maturity with enterprise-level application security capabilities, out of the box, without custom integrations.
* ...
