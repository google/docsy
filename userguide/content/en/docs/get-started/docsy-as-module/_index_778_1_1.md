## Summary

GitLab users can submit new issues and comments via email. Administrators
configure special mailboxes that GitLab polls on a regular basis and fetches new
unread emails. Based on the slug and a hash in the sub-addressing part of the
email address, we determine whether this email will file an issue, add a Service
Desk issue, or a comment to an existing issue.

Right now emails are ingested by a separate process called `mail_room`. We would
like to stop ingesting emails via `mail_room` and instead use scheduled Sidekiq
jobs to do this directly inside GitLab.

This lays out the foundation for
[custom email address ingestion for Service Desk](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329990),
detailed health logging and makes it easier to integrate other service provider
adapters (for example Gmail via API). We will also reduce the infrastructure setup
and maintenance costs for customers on self-managed and make it easier for team members to work with email ingestion in GDK.

## Glossary

- Email ingestion: Reading emails from a mailbox via IMAP or an API and
  forwarding it for processing (for example create an issue or add a comment)
- Sub-addressing: An email address consist of a local part (everything before
  `@`) and a domain part. With email sub-addressing you can create unique
  variations of an email address by adding a `+` symbol followed by any text to
  the local part. You can use these sub-addresses to filter, categorize or
  distinguish between them as all these emails will be delivered to the same
  mailbox. For example `user+subaddress@example.com` and `user+1@example.com`
  and sub-addresses for `user@example.com`.
- `mail_room`: [An executable script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-mail_room) that spawns
  a new process for each configured mailbox, reads new emails on a regular basis
  and forwards the emails to a processing unit.
- [`incoming_email`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/incoming_email.html): An email
  address that is used for adding comments and issues via email. When you reply
  on a GitLab notification of an issue comment, this response email will go to
  the configured `incoming_email` mailbox, read via `mail_room` and processed by
  GitLab. You can also use this address as a Service Desk email address. The
  configuration is per instance and needs full IMAP or Microsoft Graph API
  credentials to access the mailbox.
- [`service_desk_email`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/service_desk/configure.html#use-an-additional-service-desk-alias-email):
  Additional alias email address that is only used for Service Desk. You can
  also use an address generated from `incoming_email` to create Service Desk
  issues.
- `delivery_method`: Administrators can define how `mail_room` forwards fetched
  emails to GitLab. The legacy and now deprecated approach is called `sidekiq`,
  which directly adds a new job to the Redis queue. The current and recommended
  way is called `webhook`, which sends a POST request to an internal GitLab API
  endpoint. This endpoint then adds a new job using the full framework for
  compressing job data etc. The downside is, that `mail_room` and GitLab need a
  shared key file, which might be challenging to distribute in large setups.

## Motivation

The current implementation lacks scalability and requires significant infrastructure
maintenance. Additionally, there is a lack of
[proper observability for configuration errors](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384530) and
[overall system health](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9407). Furthermore,
[setting up and providing support for multi-node Linux package (Omnibus) installations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/391859)
is challenging, and periodic email ingestion issues necessitate reactive support.

Because we are using a fork of the `mail_room` gem
([`gitlab-mail_room`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-mail_room)),
which contains some GitLab specific features that won't be ported upstream, we have a noteable maintenance overhead.

The [Service Desk Single-Engineer-Group (SEG)](../../../development/incubation/service-desk/)
started work on [customizable email addresses for Service Desk](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329990) and
[released the first iteration in beta in `16.4`](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2023/09/22/gitlab-16-4-released/#custom-email-address-for-service-desk). As a
[MVC we introduced a `Forwarding & SMTP` mode](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329990#note_1201344150)
where administrators set up email forwarding from their custom email address to
the projects' `incoming_mail` email address. They also provide SMTP credentials
so GitLab can send emails from the custom email address on their behalf. We don't
need any additional email ingestion other than the existing mechanics for this approach to work.

As a second iteration we'd like to add Microsoft Graph support for custom email addresses
for Service Desk as well. Therefore we need a way to ingest more than the system defined
two addresses. We will explore a solution path for Microsoft Graph support where
privileged users can connect a custom email account and we can
[receive messages via a Microsoft Graph webhook (`Outlook message`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/change-notifications-overview#supported-resources).
GitLab would need a public endpoint to receive updates on emails. That might not
work for Self-managed instances, so we'll need direct email ingestion for
Microsoft customers as well. But using the webhook approach could improve performance
and efficiency for GitLab SaaS where we potentially have thousands of mailboxes to poll.

### Goals

Our goals for this initiative are to enhance the scalability of email ingestion and slim down the infrastructure significantly.

1. This consolidation will eliminate the need for setup for the separate process
   and pave the way for future initiatives, including direct custom email address ingestion
   (IMAP & Microsoft Graph), [improved health monitoring](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9407),
   [data retention (preserving originals)](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10521), and
   [enhanced processing of attachments within email size limits](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/406668).
1. Make it easier for team members to develop features with email ingestion.
   [Right now it needs several manual steps.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/blob/main/doc/howto/service_desk_mail_room.md)

### Non-Goals

This blueprint does not aim to lay out implementation details for all the listed
future initiatives. But it will be the foundation for upcoming features
(customizable Service Desk email address IMAP/Microsoft Graph, health checks etc.).

We don't include other ingestion methods. We focus on delivering the current set:
IMAP and Microsoft Graph API for `incoming_email` and `service_desk_email`.

## Current setup

Administrators configure settings (credentials and delivery method) for email
mailboxes (for [`incoming_email`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/incoming_email.html) and
[`service_desk_email`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/service_desk/configure.html#use-an-additional-service-desk-alias-email))
in `gitlab.rb` configuration file. After each change GitLab needs to be
reconfigured and restarted to apply the new settings.

We use the separate process `mail_room` to ingest emails from those mailboxes.
`mail_room` spawns a thread for each configured mailbox and polls those
mailboxes every minute. In the meantime the threads are idle. `mail_room` reads
a configuration file that is generated from the settings in `gitlab.rb`.

`mail_room` can connect via IMAP and Microsoft Graph, fetch unread emails, and
mark them as read or deleted (based on settings). It takes an email and
distributes it to its destination via one of the two delivery methods.

### `webhook` delivery method (recommended)

The `webhook` delivery method is the recommended way to move ingested emails
from `mail_room` to GitLab. `mail_room` posts the email body and metadata to an
internal API endpoint `/api/v4/internal/mail_room`, that selects the correct
handler worker and schedules it for execution.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  User --Sends email--> provider[(Email provider mailbox)]
  mail_room --Fetch unread emails via IMAP or Microsoft Graph API--> provider
  mail_room --HTTP POST--> api
  api --adds job for email--> create

  subgraph mail_room_process[mail_room]
  mail_room[mail_room thread]
  end

  subgraph GitLab
    api[Internal API endpoint]
    create["Sidekiq email handler job
  that create issue/note based
  on email address"]
  end
```

### `sidekiq` delivery method (deprecated since 16.0)

The `sidekiq` delivery method adds the email body and metadata directly to the
Redis queue that Sidekiq uses to manage jobs. It has been
[deprecated in 16.0](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#sidekiq-delivery-method-for-incoming_email-and-service_desk_email-is-deprecated)
because there is a hard coupling between the delivery method and the Redis
configuration. Moreover we cannot use Sidekiq framework optimizations such as
job payload compression.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  User --Sends email--> provider[(Email provider mailbox)]
  mail_room --Fetch unread emails via IMAP or Microsoft Graph API--> provider

  mail_room --directly writes to Redis queue, which schedules a handler job--> redis[Redis queue]
  redis --Sidekiq takes job from the queue and executes it--> create

  subgraph mail_room_process[mail_room]
  mail_room[mail_room thread]
  end

  subgraph GitLab
    create["Sidekiq email handler job
  that create issue/note based
  on email address"]
  end
```

## Proposal

**Use Sidekiq jobs to poll mailboxes on a regular basis (every minute, maybe configurable in the future).
Remove all other legacy email ingestion infrastructure.**

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  User --Sends email--> provider[(Email provider mailbox)]
  ingestion --Fetch unread emails via IMAP or Microsoft Graph API--> provider
  controller --"Triggers a job for each mailbox"--> ingestion
  ingestion --Adds a job for each fetched email--> create

  subgraph GitLab
    controller[Scheduled Sidekiq ingestion controller job]
    ingestion[Sidekiq mailbox ingestion job]
    create["Existing Sidekiq email handler jobs
  that create issue/note based
  on email address"]
end
```

1. Use a `controller` job that is scheduled every minute or every two minutes. This job adds one job for each configured mailbox (`incoming_email` and `service_desk_email`).
1. The concrete `ingestion` job polls a mailbox (IMAP or Microsoft Graph), downloads unread emails and adds one job for each email that processes the email. We decide based on the used `To` email address which email handler should be used.
1. The `existing email handler` jobs try to create an issue, a Service Desk issue or a note on an existing issue/merge request. These handlers are also used by the legacy email ingestion via `mail_room`.

### Sidekiq jobs and job payload size optimizations

We implemented a size limit for Sidekiq jobs and email job payloads (especially emails with attachments)
are likely to pass that bar. We should experiment with the idea of handling email processing
directly in the Sidekiq mailbox ingestion job. We could use an `ops` feature flag
to switch between this mode and a Sidekiq job for each email.

We'd also like to explore a solution path where we only fetch the message ids
and then download the complete messages in child jobs (filter by `UID` range for example).
For example we poll a mailbox and fetch a list of message ids. Then we
create a new job for every 25 (or n) emails that takes the message ids or the
range as an argument. These jobs will then download the entire messages and
synchronously add issues or replies. If the number of emails is below 25, we
could even handle the emails directly in the current job to save resources. This
will allow us to eliminate the job payload size as the limiting factor for the
size of emails. The disadvantage is that we need to make two calls to the IMAP
server instead of one (n+1).

## Execution plan

1. Add deprecation for `mail_room` email ingestion.
1. Strip out connection-specific logic from [`gitlab-mail_room` gem](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-mail_room), into a new separate gem. `mail_room` and other clients could use our work here. Right now we support IMAP and Microsoft Graph API connections.
1. Add new jobs (set idempotency and de-duplication flags to avoid a huge backlog of jobs if Sidekiq isn't running).
1. Add a setting (`gitlab.rb`) that enables email ingestion with Sidekiq jobs inside GitLab. We need to set `mailroom['enabled'] = false` in `gitlab.rb` to disable `mail_room` email ingestion. Maybe additionally add a feature flag.
1. Use on `gitlab.com` before general availability, but allow self-managed to try it out in `beta`.
1. Once rolled out in general availability and when removal has been scheduled, remove the dependency to `gitlab-mail_room` entirely, remove the internal API endpoint `api/internal/mail_room`, remove `mail_room.yml` dynamically generated static configuration file for `mail_room` and other configuration and binaries.

## Change management

We decided to [deprecate the `sidekiq` delivery method for `mail_room` in GitLab 16.0](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#sidekiq-delivery-method-for-incoming_email-and-service_desk_email-is-deprecated) and scheduled it for removal in GitLab 18.0.
We can only remove the `sidekiq` delivery method after this blueprint has been implemented and our customers can use the new email ingestion in general availability.

We should then schedule `mail_room` for removal (GitLab 17.0 or later). This will be a breaking change. We could make the new email ingestion the default beforehand, so self-managed customers wouldn't need to take action.

## Alternative Solutions

### Do nothing

The current setup limits us and only allows to fetch two email addresses. To
publish Service Desk custom email addresses with IMAP or API integration we
would need to deliver the same architecture as described above. Because of that
we should act now and include general email ingestion for `incoming_email` and
`service_desk_email` first and remove the infrastructure overhead.
