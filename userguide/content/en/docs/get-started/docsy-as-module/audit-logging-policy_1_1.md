System Owners are responsible for determining what constitutes "critical information system activity" in their respective system based on their experience and professional judgement

Such activity is then documented either in the handbook or a runbook, whichever is found to be appropriate. 

Audit logging process must be created and implemented by the department(s) or team(s) responsible for a given system.
