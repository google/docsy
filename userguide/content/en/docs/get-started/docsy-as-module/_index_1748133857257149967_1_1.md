title: Laptop Wipe (Factory Reset) Process
---

## Overview

Laptop wipes must be performed via [scheduling an appointment](#schedule-a-wipe) with an IT analyst to wipe the machine and re-install the base operating system, and remove any and all software and configurations that were supplied by GitLab.

Laptops must be wiped with [Jamf](/handbook/security/corporate/systems/jamf) for macOS, and [DriveStrike](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/it/it-self-service/it-guides/drivestrike/) for Linux. Using these tools ensures a clean disk wipe is performed and GitLab can retain evidence of the disk wipe.

**Under no circumstance should you perform your own disk wipe** unless you are doing so at the request of IT to troubleshoot a technical problem with the laptop. If GitLab discovers that a device has not been wiped according to policy, GitLab may act to enforce a remote wipe without notice.
