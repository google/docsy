IT Access Controls Policy

1. Introduction

At Green Orbit Digital, we recognise the importance of controlling access to our IT systems and data to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of sensitive information. Effective access control is essential for safeguarding business assets, complying with data protection regulations, and ensuring that only authorised individuals can access critical resources.

This document outlines our approach to IT access controls, providing a clear framework for managing user access rights, monitoring access activities, and mitigating the risks associated with unauthorized access.

1. Purpose

The purpose of this IT Access Controls Policy is to:

Establish a structured approach to managing access to IT systems and sensitive data.

Ensure that access to systems and data is granted on the principle of least privilege.

Protect the organisation from internal and external security threats.

Maintain compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR and ISO 27001.

Provide clear guidelines on how to handle access requests, reviews, and revocation.

1. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, third-party service providers, and anyone else who requires access to Green Orbit Digital's IT infrastructure, systems, networks, and data. This includes both digital and physical access to organisational resources.

1. Access Control Principles

Green Orbit Digital follows the following principles in managing access to IT systems and resources:

Least Privilege: Users are granted only the minimum level of access required to perform their job responsibilities. This reduces the potential impact of any unauthorized access.

Need-to-Know Basis: Access to sensitive data and systems is granted only when necessary for business operations.

Segregation of Duties: Access rights are structured so that no single user has complete control over critical processes, thereby reducing the risk of fraud or error.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access is assigned based on job roles and responsibilities. Access rights are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain appropriate for each individual’s role.

1. User Account Management

To ensure access controls are properly implemented, Green Orbit Digital follows the following user account management procedures:

User Authentication: All users must authenticate through strong means, including but not limited to username and password combinations, multi-factor authentication (MFA), or biometrics, depending on the system and sensitivity of the data involved.

Account Creation: User accounts are created based on the individual’s job role and responsibilities. Account creation must be approved by the relevant manager and the IT team.

Account Modification: When a user’s role changes, access rights should be updated promptly to reflect their new responsibilities. Any additional access should be approved through a formal process.

Account Deactivation: When a user leaves the organisation or no longer requires access to certain systems, their account should be deactivated immediately. Deactivation should include revoking all access rights and ensuring any access credentials (such as passwords or tokens) are disabled.

Temporary Access: Temporary access can be granted in exceptional cases, such as during onboarding or when contractors are hired for short-term tasks. These accounts must be time-bound and automatically expire at the end of the specified duration.

1. Access Control Mechanisms

Green Orbit Digital employs the following access control mechanisms to protect systems and data:

Authentication: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for access to critical systems, especially for remote access. Passwords must meet minimum complexity standards (e.g., a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters) and must be changed regularly.

Access Control Lists (ACLs): ACLs define who can access specific resources and what actions they can perform (read, write, execute, etc.). These are implemented on both network systems and application software.

Encryption: Sensitive data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit to ensure its confidentiality, even if access controls are bypassed.

Monitoring and Logging: All access to sensitive data and systems will be logged and monitored for suspicious activity. Logs will be reviewed regularly to detect unauthorized access attempts or policy violations.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access permissions are assigned based on an individual's role within the organisation. A role may define what data or systems a user can access and what actions they can perform. This ensures that individuals only have access to what is necessary for their work.

1. Access Review and Audits

Green Orbit Digital conducts regular reviews and audits of user access rights to ensure that:

Access Permissions are Appropriate: Access rights are reviewed periodically, especially after role changes, department transfers, or when there are changes in job responsibilities.

Compliance with Policies: Access to systems and data is in compliance with internal policies and external regulations. Audits will confirm that no excessive access rights are granted.

Audit Trails: Detailed logs of user activities (e.g., login times, systems accessed) are kept and can be audited to ensure compliance with the access control policy. These logs will also be used to investigate security incidents.

1. Access Revocation

Access rights must be revoked promptly in the following scenarios:

Termination of Employment: When an employee leaves Green Orbit Digital, all access to company systems must be terminated immediately. The user’s access credentials will be disabled or deleted.

Change in Role or Responsibilities: If a user’s role changes and their new role does not require the same level of access, their access rights should be adjusted accordingly.

Breach of Security: If an employee or contractor is found to have violated security policies, their access may be revoked as a disciplinary action.

1. Remote Access and Third-Party Access

For employees and third parties requiring remote access to Green Orbit Digital’s systems:

Virtual Private Network (VPN): Remote access must be secured through a company-approved VPN to ensure encrypted communication with the organisation’s network.

Third-Party Vendors: Third-party service providers requiring access to our systems will be given limited access based on the principle of least privilege. Access will be monitored, and third-party contracts will include provisions for data security and access control.

Mobile Devices: Employees who use mobile devices for work purposes must ensure their devices are protected with a password, encryption, and other appropriate security measures.

1. Training and Awareness

All employees will receive regular training on the importance of access control and secure practices. Training will cover:

Access Control Policies: Understanding role-based access and the principle of least privilege.

Authentication and Password Management: The proper creation, management, and storage of secure passwords.

Remote Access Security: The risks associated with accessing company data and systems from outside the office and how to mitigate these risks.

Data Privacy and Confidentiality: The importance of protecting sensitive and personal data from unauthorized access.

1. Compliance and Consequences of Violations

Failure to comply with this IT Access Controls Policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contractual agreements. Violations may also expose the organisation to legal and regulatory consequences, especially in relation to data protection and cybersecurity laws.

1. Conclusion

Effective access control is critical for the security of Green Orbit Digital’s information and systems. By following the guidelines outlined in this policy, we aim to prevent unauthorized access, protect sensitive data, and maintain compliance with relevant regulations. It is the responsibility of all employees, contractors, and third parties to adhere to these access control measures to help safeguard the organisation’s IT infrastructure.
