Contact various organisations (cloud / hosting / browser vendors, standards bodies, etc) to request if they would get involved and help improve the guidelines. 

<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-ig/issues/10">Review feature requests and set timeline / schedule for specification</a>
Discuss the below features, set a timeline or schedule date for the WSG (any other feature ideas please submit as we are open to anything that will help mature the spec).
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/5">Review Overlapping Guidelines</a>

<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/6">Standards Referencing</a>
Tzviya: less of a problem to link to standards like ISO than proprietary links than Azure, but we can revisit proprietary later. Because there is so much happening now with standards, it makes sense to have links to ISO, IEEE, IETF
Neil: it would be helpful to have additional resources as well, including proprietary
Alex: we can have separation of concerns within doc
Hannah: very keen to support work on gathering together actionable resources such as case studies or specific, tangible examples or working out how to make whatâ€™s there more navigable. It would support needs we keep hearing from those out in the community trying to take steps - what are each of these resources and how do they help each guideline more specifically. Hit me up for a chat if of interest to explore ðŸ˜€

<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/7">Tooling Support</a>
Discussion about need from browsers and tool developers to understand how to expose sustainability data to users and for testing purposes. 
Mike: ATAG could be useful if integrated within WSG as it would provide structured guidance for implementation from those helping users make sustainable choices.
Tzviya: this should be a fundamental goal of the group

<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/8">Translations</a>
Alex: weâ€™ll address after writing
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/9">Measurability</a>
How do we define which tools are most impactful, most effortful, system boundaries/trade-offs. Weâ€™d like to build up implementation report from tooling. This will come from Measurability TF. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DKfIdm0mHkyzTVv41hogUdh41SnLkk9Uwkc8Nm6bqD4/edit?usp=sharing">basis</a> of STAR.
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/10">Educational Materials</a>
We will work on bolstering image, help people understand materials. This feeds into adoption
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/11">Useful Tooling</a>
List useful tools

Save the date: Next meeting is <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/sustainableweb/calendar/">Jan 23 2025</a>.
