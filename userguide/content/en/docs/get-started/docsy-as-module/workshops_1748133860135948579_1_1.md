title: Workshops
description: Workshops are interactive events designed to provide GitLab prospects and customers with hands-on experience in a live GitLab environment. Led by GitLab Solution Architects, these half-day pre-sales enablement sessions cover essential use cases and serve as an efficient alternative to extensive proofs of value (POVs).
---

Common workshop topics include:

- DevOps Automation
- Portfolio and Project Management
- Security
- Advanced CI/CD

These sessions accelerate customer comfort and awareness while helping to refine and reduce technical evaluation requirements. Workshops often minimize or eliminate the need for extensive POVs and can lead directly to technical wins.

## Technical Requirements

Each workshop requires:

- A dedicated GitLab instance for attendees to use during exercises
- Pre-configured class projects
- Setup of issue tracking workflows
- Additional environment preparation specific to the workshop topic

For more information, review the [Hands-On Workshop Tools and Resources](/handbook/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/workshop) handbook page.

## Capacity and Format

To ensure optimal experience:

- Attendance is limited to 200 or fewer participants
- This limit enables:
  - Stable working environments for all attendees
  - Timely responses to questions and issues
  - Effective hands-on guidance

### Key Benefits

The workshop approach delivers multiple strategic advantages in the pre-sales process:

- Dramatically accelerates customer comfort and awareness with GitLab's extensive feature set through direct, hands-on experience
- Substantially reduces or completely eliminates the requirement for time-consuming and resource-intensive POVs
- Provides technical teams with immediate, practical experience in applying GitLab to their specific use cases

## Workshops vs Demonstrations

Understanding the distinct characteristics of workshops and demonstrations is crucial for effective pre-sales engagement:

| Aspect | Workshop | Demonstration |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Duration | Extended engagement (2-4 hours) | Focused presentation (30-60 minutes) |
| Scope | Comprehensive coverage of multiple use cases and features | Targeted exploration of specific functionality |
| Interaction Level | High engagement with hands-on activities, exercises, and practical application | Primarily observational with Q&A opportunities |
| Problem Focus | Broad exploration of use cases with deep-dive capabilities | Specific solution demonstration for identified challenges |
| Audience Engagement | Active participation required, with practical exercises and independent exploration | Passive viewing with occasional interaction through questions |
| Resource Investment | Significant preparation and delivery time, requires dedicated technical resources | Minimal preparation, can be delivered by individual team member |
| Outcome | Comprehensive understanding and practical experience | Basic feature awareness and solution visibility |
| Follow-up Requirements | Often reduces need for additional technical evaluation | May lead to requests for more detailed exploration |
