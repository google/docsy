## 4. Risk Treatment Strategies

Risk responses will be selected based on the level of exposure and strategic importance:

- Avoid: Change plans or processes to eliminate the risk

- Mitigate: Introduce controls to reduce the likelihood or impact

- Transfer: Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance, outsourcing)

- Accept: Accept low-level risks with a monitoring plan

Each risk will have a documented treatment action plan with assigned owners and deadlines.
