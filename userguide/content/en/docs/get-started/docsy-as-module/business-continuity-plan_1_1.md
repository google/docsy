Your insurance policy cover might allow you to replace damaged equipment, repair damaged property, or cover you for business disruption, allowing you to claim back any loss of earnings.

## Finalising your business continuity plan

With all the information across your key functions, resources, and contingencies, you should be able to create step-by-step instructions on how to execute your business continuity plan.

- List the names and responsibilities of the people in your plan

- File all your information together as one document

- Make copies of your plan for your continuity team and in a location off-site

## Reviewing your business continuity plan

As with many business processes, you should review your business continuity plan regularly to make sure it’s up-to-date and fit for purpose. As we’ve seen with the spread of COVID-19, risks to your business can develop and change rapidly.

### When should you review your plan?

### Changes to your company operation

- Relocation to new offices or acquiring a new site

- New products or services

- Changing priority levels in your business

- New equipment, upgrades to your technology, or changes to your production processes

- The emergency site you plan to work from and recover your business is no longer accessible

### Changes to people in your business

- When you change key staff that your business can’t function without, such as senior employees who lead your sales team or manage your company accountancy

- When you appoint staff to manage a new site

- When responsibilities of your staff change, such as junior employees being promoted to key senior roles

- When you change your suppliers or extend your list of key external contacts

- When key staff may need to work remotely on a temporary, permanent or flexible basis

### How often should you review your plan?

You should aim to review your plan at least once a year, or every six months, if possible. Setting time aside to do this can help you identify new risks. Once reviewed and updated, you need to redistribute your plan. Make sure everyone is aware of the changes you’ve made, so your business is prepared for when the plan must be put into action. Save your updated plan in a secure location and discard any outdated versions of the plan.
