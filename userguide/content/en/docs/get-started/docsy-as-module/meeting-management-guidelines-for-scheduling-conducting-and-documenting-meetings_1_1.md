Absolutely — let's elevate this according to best practices and ISO standards.

In particular, I'll align the structure and wording with common standards from:

- ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems – focus on records, continual improvement)

- ISO 21500 / ISO 21502 (Guidelines for Project Management)

- ISO 30401 (Knowledge Management – documentation discipline)

- General best practices for Information Management and Internal Controls

This means making it more formal, more traceable, clearly assigning responsibilities, ensuring record-keeping compliance, and building in continual improvement (review, lessons learned).

Here’s the reworked version:

Would you also like me to provide an example template for Meeting Agenda, Meeting Minutes, and Action Tracker next?

It would make rolling out these guidelines even easier!
