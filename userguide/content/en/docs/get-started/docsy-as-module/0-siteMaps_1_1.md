### sitemaps
A sitemap is a file where you provide information about the pages, videos, and other files on your site, and the relationships between them, 

Search engines like Google read this file to crawl your site more efficiently. A sitemap tells search engines which pages and files you think are important in your site, and also provides valuable information about these files. For example, when the page was last updated and any alternate language versions of the page, it is a signal about which URLs you would like google to crawl on your site

If your site's pages are properly linked, Google can usually discover most of your site

#### you might need a sitemap if
- Your site is large
- Your site is new and has few external links to it
- site has a lot of rich media content (video, images) or is shown in Google News.

### supported way from google to provide additional information

2. include information about alternate languages or country versions wit `hreflang` notations
3. for new sites, you can use a special variations of sitemaps to give google information about the most recent updates

> [!NOTE]
> sitemaps don't replace normal crawling and not including URLs in a sitemap, won't result in those URLs no longer being crawled

> [NOTE]
> google also recommend finding a way to automatically generate your sitemap instead of creating them manually, usually this will include running code in your server
