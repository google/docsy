<h1>What is Open SDG?</h1>

[Open SDG](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg)  is an open source, free-to-reuse platform for managing and publishing data and statistics related to the [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDGs). 

It is built exclusively with open-source libraries and tools and can be hosted and maintained using free services.

Open SDG is the result of collaboration between the UK [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus) (ONS), US government, the nonprofit [Center for Open Data Enterprise](https://www.opendataenterprise.org/) (CODE) and members of the Open SDG community.

# Why choose a reporting platform?

Using a reporting platform such as Open SDG facilitates countries and organisations to:

* Gather, disseminate, and track national or local data on the SDG indicators, including identification of data gaps.
* Improve access to official statistics and metadata.

For countries, a national reporting platform also enables them to:

* Report country national data to be harmonized for international purposes (i.e. UN global indicator database).
* Improve communication between data providers, National Statistics Offices (NSOs), custodian agencies, and other stakeholders.
