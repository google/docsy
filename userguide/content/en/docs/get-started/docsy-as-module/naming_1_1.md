## Overview

Welcome to the GitLab naming handbook. This page covers everything you need to know about naming products, features, events, and other initiatives.

When we name products and features, we typically take a clear and straightforward approach by using descriptive names rather than distinctive ones. For specific examples and details, check out our [Product and Feature Naming Guidelines](/handbook/product/product-principles/#product-and-feature-naming-guidelines).

We also name new initiatives, events, and other offerings at GitLab (e.g. The Source, our thought leadership platform). For those projects, we may choose a more distinctive name, but we approach this on a case-by-case basis. Any naming convention should tie back to the GitLab brand, product, and identity.

Ready to name something? The Brand & Creative team is here to support. Follow the steps below to get started.

## The naming process

Each naming project at GitLab is unique, so the process may differ slightly depending on the details and scope.

The Brand & Creative team is here to guide and facilitate, not take over. We’ll work alongside you and the project stakeholders in a collaborative way, providing strategic support, naming best practices, and brainstorming sessions. Think of us as your naming partners.

### Our typical process

#### 1. Create a naming brief

To kick off the project, please fill out a naming brief using [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f0hJGpWtKqgY4NJfR79w_3-isbgKS8KXecZkMx5gHe0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gh2y4j35hern) (make a copy), and share it with the Brand & Creative team.

- Fill out each section thoroughly. This brief will be the single source of truth for the project.
- Gather input from all stakeholders prior to submitting the brief to ensure everyone is aligned and there are no gaps.
- Reach out to Brand & Creative in the #brand Slack channel with any questions about the brief.

#### 2. Live brainstorm session

Once the brief is approved, Brand & Creative will help schedule and facilitate a brainstorming session. Here’s what we recommend:

- Keep the group focused with 6-8 stakeholders with various points of view on the project.
- Plan for a 50-minute session (45-minute minimum).
- Reserve the first 5 minutes to review the brief together and address any remaining questions.
- Come prepared to share any initial ideas, but keep an open mind to build on others’ suggestions.
- Keep in mind that the goal of the session is to come up with a list of recommended names, and allow the stakeholders to vote on their top 1-3 choices.
- Note that in some cases, you may need an additional brainstorming session to elaborate on the first round of ideas.

#### 3. Recommendation and approval

Once the recommended name(s) have been determined, the DRI will put together naming recommendation slides. These slides should:
     - Share the brief
     - Outline the process: brainstorm approach, who was involved, key points in the discussion
     - Explain the recommendation(s)

- This recommendation proposal will be shared with the stakeholders for review and approval.
- If we’re naming a product or feature, both Product and Marketing leadership will need to review and approve the recommended name.
- Some naming projects for products or features may also require Legal review for trademark searches, etc.

## Timeline

Naming is a multi-step process, so please engage our team as early as possible. We need at least 2-3 weeks once the brief has been completed to align stakeholders, gather ideas, conduct a brainstorm session, compile a recommendation, and secure approval.

Have an urgent request? Reach out to Brand & Creative in the #brand Slack channel. We’ll do our best to support accelerated timelines.

Please note that complex naming projects (e.g. major product launch) may require additional time for trademark searches, etc.

### Naming tips and tricks 

As you’re brainstorming and creating a naming recommendation, consider these tips and strategies:

- Approach the brainstorm with an open mind and be ready to build off of others’ ideas.
- Start with a broad list and narrow down ideas later.
- Build on words or phrases by looking for synonyms or word associations.
- Think about what themes and words resonate best with your intended audience and tie back to the GitLab brand.
- Consider whether words are easy to pronounce and globally relevant.
- Ensure you’re choosing names that will still fit the project or initiative over time.
- Consider using AI as a thought partner in the process. Ask Claude to help compile additional competitor or industry examples, expand on idea threads, or suggest naming approaches.
