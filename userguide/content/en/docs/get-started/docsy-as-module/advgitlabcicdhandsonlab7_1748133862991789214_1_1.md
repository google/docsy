description: "This Hands-On Guide walks you through the process of creating feature flags"
---

The next step in your development process is to determine an appropriate deployment strategy for your application. Rolling out changes to all users at once is a risky strategy, since any errors will impact all of your users and potentially cause outages. To mitigate this, you can take advantage of GitLabâ€™s deployment features. In this section, you will learn how to implement a feature flag in your application to allow for a gradual rollout of features.

> Estimated time to complete: 15 minutes

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Use GitLab's feature flag functionality

## Task A. Implement a Feature Flag

In this task, you will implement a feature flag in your application using GitLab's feature flag functionality. This will allow you to gradually roll out new features to a subset of users, reducing the risk of widespread issues if problems arise.

Follow these steps to set up and use a feature flag:

1. Navigate to **Deploy > Feature flags**.

1. Select **New Feature Flag**.

1. For the name, input `test`. For the Type, select `Percent rollout`.

1. Set the percentage to 50%, and set the **Based on** to Random.

1. Select **Create feature flag**.

1. After creating the feature flag, select **Configure**. Take note of the API URL and Instance ID fields. You will need these for your code changes.

1. Select your `index.js` file.

1. Select **Edit > Edit in single file**.

1. In your `index.js` file, remove all of your existing code and replace it with the following, ensuring to replace **your-instance-url** and **your-instance-id** with the values your made a note of earlier:

    ```js
    const { initialize } = require('unleash-client');

    const unleash = initialize({
      url: 'your-instance-url',
      appName:'production',
      instanceId: 'your-instance-id'
    });

    setInterval(() => {
    if (unleash.isEnabled('test')) {
        console.log('Toggle enabled');
    } else {
        console.log('Toggle disabled');
    }
    }, 1000);
    ```

1. Select **Commit changes**.

    > This code will continually run, attempting to check if the feature flag toggle is enabled or disabled. Since it is enabled for 50% of users, you should see it around half the time when this runs.

1. To test running this, we will test running the script.

1. Open you `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

1. Select **Edit > Edit in pipeline editor**.

1. Replace your whole `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with the following code:

    ```yml
    default:
      image: node:latest
      
    stages:
      - test

    test_flag:
      stage: test
      script:
        - npm i unleash-client
        - node index.js
    ```

1. Select **Commit changes**.

1. After committing your changes, in the left sidebar, select **Build > Pipelines**.

1. Select the `test_flag` job.

1. Observe that sometimes this job outputs true and sometimes it outputs false. This is because the feature flag is active 50% of the time.
