### Message house

### Context

Budget and influence are key for this play, so our basic assumption is that upleveling to someone’s boss isn’t going to be enough *all the time* - people need to reach out to additional business units, namely security, and bring in “fresh” teams and opportunities within existing accounts.

- Additionally, we need to enable and equip current Premium customers and their teams to be more “active champions” by showing them the light that is the value of Ultimate. When thinking about the value of Ultimate at the highest level

Think *security and reducing risk, protecting the business's intellectual property and sensitive data, enabling modern CD with compliance and audit controls, and providing visibility/insights at different levels from ICs to executive insights*

**The who**

- Economic buyers: CISO or Security Manager, VP of Security, Director of Security, VP of IT or CTO, App/Dev Director

- Technical influencers: Chief Architect, App Dev Manager
