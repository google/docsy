## Ian Steward's README

## Why I’m at GitLab

I’d long been aware of developers’ and enterprises’ love for GitLab’s products, as well as the company’s unwavering commitment to their values and unique culture. After spending time with the management team and Board, I realized that there was a confluence of factors that created an opportunity for GitLab to become an enduring generational company.

There are so many amazing companies out there, but so few of them are in a position where their level of execution is what will decide their fate. 

It’s rare to get a combination of the right market, product, people, and culture all at the right time – GitLab has that, and that’s why I’m here. 

## About Me

I’m a builder and a grinder by nature. I’ve found that channeling my energy into building and mobilizing teams, solving challenging problems, and delivering business outcomes produces an outsized return in a variety of areas, both personal and professional. This has translated into a true love of work for me.

I tend to move fast, think long-term, and care deeply about outcomes. I believe that business, at its core, is mobilizing people. And mobilizing people requires the right combination of inspiration, motivation, and prescription. 

I work best when the goal is clear, and the pace is high; I am energized by solving problems with smart people and turning ideas into action.
You’ll find that I lead with an open door, a low ego, and a bias toward action. I speak with conviction but welcome pushback. 

My goal is to create an environment where great ideas rise, people grow, and results follow.

## My Values

1. **Growth** - I’m always learning and value working with people open to new perspectives, feedback, and challenges. Growth comes from curiosity, not just effort.

1. **Integrity** - I do what’s right for the business, provided it doesn’t compromise my core principles. Integrity builds trust, and trust enables performance. When you take a long-term view and focus on what’s right for the business, benefit tends to naturally accrue to you over time. 

1. **Performance** - In the areas where I choose to invest my time and compete, I do it with the goal of performing at the highest level possible and winning.

## My Superpowers

1. **Action** – I'm maniacally focused on execution. Those who work closely with me will often hear me ask:

   > "But did the field adopt it?" 
   > "Is it actually improving productivity?"
   > "What specific actions will come out of that meeting that impact the business tomorrow?"
   > "Does the team know HOW to do that?"

   I inherently believe that businesses overindex on strategy and underindex on execution – and the ability to execute creates a massive competitive advantage!

2. **Boldness** – I think and dream big – and believe truly audacious goals can be accomplished. The ability to do something starts with the belief that it can be done.

3. **Grit** – I've learned that I'm very resilient, and most people are more resilient than they may actually believe. If you can learn to find comfort in discomfort, you'll continue to make progress even in the face of major challenges.

## My Weaknesses

1. **Directness** – I move quickly to business substance, and can overlook people’s feelings or nuances that are important to others. I’m always working on this, and open to being called on it.

1. **Impatience** – My general bias towards action sometimes manifests in impatience and some level of annoyance with the status quo. I’m constantly trying to find the right balance of acting with intention and continually improving with having realistic expectations of what can be done in a specified time period.

1. **Balance** – Finding the right work-life balance while keeping a demanding pace has been a growth area for me. What's really helped is building a system – my Saturdays have become incredibly productive blocks where I dive deep into data, strategize, and clear my inbox. Importantly, this also means setting clear boundaries for my team; I expect them to handle things during work hours so they can properly switch off outside of that, unless it's truly urgent. This approach lets me run at the speed I need to while still protecting my teams’ personal time.

## Communication Style

1. **Bottom-line first** – Lead with the decision or recommendation, then provide context and data.

1. **Async preferred** – Slack or email with a clear headline, context, and ask. For transactional items, I’ll usually address them on the same day, items that require more thought but are not urgent, the same week, often on Saturday or Sunday mornings, but I don’t expect a response back over the weekend. 

1. **Quick calls for nuance** – Strategic and complex topics are better live. Call my cell, send me a text, or work with my EBA, and we’ll prioritize accordingly.

1. **Open to challenge** – I think out loud and revise quickly. Don’t confuse my decisiveness with finality; I’m open to being challenged. 

## My Expectations of the Team

1. **Adaptability** – We’re in a dynamic growth-oriented environment, and while we should not waste energy on low-yield pursuits or changes, we need to be in a state of continual improvement and not settling for the status quo. I expect my team to be adaptable and receptive to change that will positively impact the business. 

1. **Meritocratic and apolitical** – I believe that excessive corporate politics are a result of a broken values system. Rewarding individuals for something other than effort or performance breeds politics and a focus on things that will not positively impact the business. We will partner to create a meritocratic environment that rewards results and reduces politics.

1. **Focus on impact** – Showing people “how” is leadership. If we are unable to articulate how to do something, our strategy is incomplete and will likely not have its desired impact. We should constantly be asking ourselves whether we know “how” to do something, and if the answer is “no”, we need to surface and change.

1. **Solution orientation** – Warren Buffet famously said: “Predicting rain doesn’t count; building arks does.” I couldn’t agree more. Our ability to, and the speed at which we, pivot from identifying problems to solving them will have a material impact on business outcomes.

## My Role

* I am the Chief Revenue Officer of GitLab.
* I’m responsible for driving growth through alignment, accountability, and operational excellence across all revenue functions.

## Final Note

High-performing teams are built on trust, accountability, and a shared commitment to results. My goal is to create the conditions for that to happen—at scale. If we stay aligned and move with intent, we’ll build something meaningful and lasting.
Let’s get to work!
