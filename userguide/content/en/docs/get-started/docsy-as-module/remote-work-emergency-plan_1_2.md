Due to global issues concerning [COVID-19 (Coronavirus)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), many employees and employers are facing a new reality: they're remote, and they’re unsure of when they’ll be able to return to the office.

For **leaders** who are suddenly managing work-from-home teams, there are five things you can focus on right now to maximize stability.

*(If you're an **employee** adjusting to a WFH reality, see our [worker-focused starter guide]({{< ref "./remote-work-starter-guide" >}}).)*

## Untangling remote work and forced work-from-home

Tens of millions of people globally are experiencing a seismic shift in work. Many have been forced into their homes and asked to not only make do, but maintain or increase their productivity. For many, this is their first extended experience with work-from-home.

Globally, the narrative has neglected nuance, referencing the phenomenon as a global "[remote work experiment](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200710-the-remote-work-experiment-that-made-staff-more-productive)."

It is neither remote work nor an experiment.

Being forced to work from home during a pandemic restricts all but a handful of [remote work benefits]({{< ref "remote-benefits" >}}). Losing the commute and making synchronous [meetings]({{< ref "./meetings" >}}) more human are two perks which are felt, but the *heart* of remote work — the freedom to choose where you work, the ability to weave life into your work schedule, the opportunity to optimize your life for something other than proximity to an office — remains squashed.

Particularly for leaders who survey their workforce to understand their perspective on remote work, be intentional about highlighting this reality. Make a concerted effort to untangle "remote work" from "crisis-induced work-from-home." In asking someone if they would prefer to remain remote forever, for example, it's important to clarify that *remote* is fundamentally different than *working from home while quarantined*. Many workers may need assistance to visualize a remote future which is liberating as opposed to isolating.

## Establish a Remote Leadership Team

{style="max-width: 50%"}

Shifting an entire division or company to remote triggers a [shockwave of change]({{< ref "./transition" >}}). Evaluate current managers and rally a team of experts who have remote work experience, and are able to communicate nuances and serve as resources to those who will inevitably have questions. A core part of this team's role will be to document challenges in real time, transparently prioritize those challenges, and assign DRIs ([directly responsible individuals]({{< ref "directly-responsible-individuals#empowering-dris-no-explanation-needed" >}})) to find solutions.

Executive assistants may take on a more significant role in the transition, functioning as a documentarian in meetings and aiding with internal communications cascaded to the rest of the organization.

## Establish a handbook

![GitLab collaboration illustration](/images/all-remote/gitlab-collaboration.jpg)
{style="max-width: 50%"}

This will be rudimentary to start, and will serve as a [single source of truth]({{< ref "./handbook-first" >}}) for more pressing questions. Communicate this company-wide, and update it continually with DRIs for common questions around tools and access. This can start as a single company webpage or repository in [Notion](https://www.notion.so) or [Almanac](https://almanac.io), and will serve you well even after the current crisis subsides.

[GitLab uses GitLab]({{< ref "./gitlab-for-remote" >}}) to build, sustain, and evolve its company handbook. GitLab is a collaboration tool designed to help people work better together whether they are in the same location or spread across multiple time zones. Originally, GitLab let software developers collaborate on writing code and packaging it up into software applications. Today, GitLab has a wide range of capabilities used by people around the globe in all kinds of companies and roles.

You can learn more at GitLab's [remote team solutions page]({{< ref "./gitlab-for-remote" >}}).

One of the most sizable challenges when going remote is keeping everyone informed in an efficient way. Put concerted effort around systematically documenting important process changes in a central place to minimize [confusion and dysfunction]({{< ref "values#five-dysfunctions" >}}).

## Establish a communications plan

Discover more in GitLab's [Remote Work playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0Kq7QUX-Ux5fOunQotqJbECc).*

Depending on team size, consider an always-on video conference room per team, where team members can linger, or come and go as they please. This simulation helps acclimation, enabling team members to embrace the shift to remote in a [less jarring way](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/08/05/tips-for-mastering-video-calls). It also shows intentionality around [informal communication]({{< ref "./informal-communication" >}}) — an important element that occurs spontaneously in an office, and needs an immediate replacement in a remote setting.

Whatever your current view on transparency, leaders should not hold back during this time. It's vital to maintain perspective through this shift. Everyone reacts to remote work differently, and not all homes are ideal [workspaces](./workspace). This can (and likely will) feel jarring, and team members will expect frequent updates as leaders iterate on their communication plan in real-time.

For a fast-boot on this front, consider replicating GitLab's public [communication guide]({{< ref "communication" >}}).

## Minimize your tool stack

While functioning remotely, strip the tool stack down to a minimum. Google Docs, a company-wide chat tool (like Microsoft Teams or [Slack]({{< ref "communication#slack" >}})), and [Zoom](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/08/05/tips-for-mastering-video-calls) are all you need to start. If your team needs access to internal systems through a VPN, ensure that everyone has easy access, and instructions on usage are clear.

Working well remotely requires [writing things down]({{< ref "./effective-communication" >}}). For companies who do not have an existing culture of documentation, this will prove to be the most difficult shift. Aim to funnel communication into as few places as possible to reduce silos and fragmentation. You'll want to proactively solve for mass confusion when it comes to finding things — policies, protocols, outreach mechanisms, messaging, etc.

## Drive change

{style="max-width: 50%"}

Humans are naturally resistant to change — particularly change that is forced during times of uncertainty or crisis. Leaders will have to meet this reality head-on. An all-hands approach to recognizing the new reality is advised, and is vital to empowering everyone to contribute to the success of a remote model.

Particularly for companies with a strong "in-office experience" it is vital for leadership to recognize that the remote transition is a *process*, not a binary switch to be flipped. Leaders are responsible for embracing iteration, being open about what is and is not working, and messaging this to all employees.

Managing a remote company is much like managing any company. It comes down to **trust, communication, and company-wide support of shared goals**.
