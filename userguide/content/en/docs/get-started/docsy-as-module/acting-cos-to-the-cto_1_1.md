## Chief of Staff to the CTO

This role will help enable communication, collaboration, strategy execution, and special projects across the CTO organization. The responsibilities include both directed work that will mostly be triggered by a direction from the CTO, as well as leadership work that is self-directed and includes inputs and priorities from the CTO leadership team. This individual will work in close partnership with the CTO to drive programs and execute and monitor our business strategy. The role requires a sharp, critical thinker who can solve business issues and communicate effectively.  

### Responsibilities

#### Projects

- Organize and determine a program for a potential CTO Staff Offsite (virtual or on-site) in the last month of your term.
- Initiate and guide the CTO team OKR process according to the [OKR schedule](/handbook/company/okrs/#schedule/) (in partnership with the Chief of Staff to the CEO team).
- Manage, track, and moderate OKRs for Engineering to ensure CTO Staff remain on track, and know their attention points throughout the quarter.
- Lead the retrospection of the previous quarter OKRs in the first month of your term.
- Drive future special projects, such as past examples like
  - The [Volunteer Coaching Program for URGs](/handbook/engineering/volunteer-coaches-for-urgs/)
  - The vendor selection and implementation of the [Ally OKR system](/handbook/engineering/#allyio-for-okrs)

#### Communication

- Manage specific Engineering meetings, including (but not limited to) setting the agenda and providing insights and analysis to inform strategic conversations. Document and communicate decisions and action items from meetings. Ensure follow-up and closure of action items to increase accountability.

- Participate in all Engineering Division Key Review meetings by asking clarifying and strategic questions.
- Curate the Engineering Week-in-Review each Friday, ensuring the content is relevant.
- Effectively triage escalations. Our teams often rely heavily on quick root-cause analyses and fast information sharing. Time-sensitive escalations may include driving cross-functional conversations to get to the bottom of complex issues that have become a business blocker or helping ensure a fast turnaround for specific prospects and customer needs.

#### Collaboration

- Act as a sounding board to the CTO for new ideas and initiatives.
- Maintain and foster a close partnership, collaborating effectively with the Office of the CEO on strategic initiatives.
