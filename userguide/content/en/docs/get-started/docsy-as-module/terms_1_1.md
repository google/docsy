# Terms & Guidelines

### How may I use the API? <a href="#how-may-i-use-the-api" id="how-may-i-use-the-api"></a>

#### DO <a href="#do" id="do"></a>

I encourage you to build applications that **extend** Raindrop.io to platforms beyond the web and offer services that Raindrop.io does not.

#### DON’T <a href="#dont" id="dont"></a>

Don’t build what I'm building. I invested a lot of time, money and hard work in Raindrop.io. I rely on Raindrop.io for income. As such, do not build an application, website, product, or business that attempts to harm, or replace Raindrop.io, website, or services.

In particular, do not use the API, or any Raindrop.io data, to build the following:

* A website that replicates or replaces raindrop.io

I'll do the best to communicate fair use of the Raindrop.io API in this space and others, but the onus is on you to contact me and inquire whether your use of the API is permitted.

### Commercial Use <a href="#commercial-use" id="commercial-use"></a>

You are free to use the Raindrop.io API for commercial use, provided that you abide by these terms and do not build an application or business that attempts to harm, compete with or replace Raindrop.io, our website, or our services.

### Be Gentle <a href="#be-gentle" id="be-gentle"></a>

Don’t overburden our servers. We’ve published some specifics with regard to rate limiting, but we reserve the right to determine abuse or excessive usage of the API and throttle or block any service accordingly. Attempts to circumvent rate limiting, such as leveraging multiple applications or generating bogus user accounts, are strictly prohibited.

### Termination <a href="#termination" id="termination"></a>

Raindrop.io can refuse API access at any time for any reason. This is not a card we hope to play often, but it’s impossible to anticipate every situation. We reserve the right to decline any request for API usage and block access to the API.

### Liability <a href="#liability" id="liability"></a>

Raindrop.io is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages arising from your use of the API. These include, but are not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, resulting from your API usage or third-party products that access data via the API.

Your use of the Raindrop.io API is at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage that results its use, including, but not limited to, any damage to computer systems or loss of data incurred by you, your users, or your customers.

### Terms Can Change <a href="#terms-can-change" id="terms-can-change"></a>

Raindrop.io reserves the right to update and change these terms at any time without notice.\
