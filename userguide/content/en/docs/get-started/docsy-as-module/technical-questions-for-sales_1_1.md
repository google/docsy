## **Introduction**

To improve sales efficiency and reduce the dependence of GitLab sales team members on Solution Architects (SAs), the SA team identified and answered the most common technical questions they believe GitLab sales team members should be able to answer. The following questions have been organized by [DevOps lifecycle stage](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/).

### Manage

#### What authentication options are available when using .com?

- **Short answer**: SCIM, SSO, and OAuth

</figure>

- **Learn more**: Check out the [System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/scim_setup.html)

#### What options do we have to manage user access on .com?

- **Short answer**: In the Members section of a group, a group owner can invite existing or new users to a group. A group owner can also enable or disable the ability for non-members to request access to a group. SCIM can be configured, so users can be added as guests to a group or groups automatically.

- **Learn more**: Check out the [SAML SSO for GitLab.com groups documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/)

#### How should customers set up and customize user roles in GitLab?

- **Short answer**: GitLab manages access control through a combination of group-level and project-level visibility settings and user access levels for members. Groups and projects have three levels of visibility and users have five levels of access.

- **Learn more**: There are multiple types of permissions across GitLab, and when implementing anything that deals with permissions, all of them should be considered. Check out the [GitLab permissions guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/permissions.html).

#### How can users be auto-provisioned?

- **Short answer**: Use LDAP integration

- **Learn more**: Review the [Create users through integrations documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/account/create_accounts.html#create-users-through-integrations)

#### How is user management different on .com compared to self-managed?

- **Short answer**: Since self-managed admins have complete ownership of the environment, they have more flexibility and configuration control. There are three buckets of primary differences:

1. Instance-level controls that just aren’t possible on a shared server
1. Directory integration options, and
1. A few authentication options that are missing from GitLab.com (e.g. Kerberos and smartcard auth)

### Plan

#### What best practices exist around using projects/groups?

  - Watch this [How to set up GitLab groups and projects to run multiple Agile teams with microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR2r1TJCDew) video (Jan 2019, 15 minutes)

#### How can we integrate Jira?

- **Short answer**: GitLab is a complete DevOps platform, delivered as a single application for everything from project planning and source code management to CI/CD, monitoring, and security. GitLab issues is a powerful tool for idea management, iteration planning, issue tracking and software development. However, we recognize that many organizations have been using Jira for many years and have existing data and business processes built into it. For some of these customers, this means it can be difficult and cost-prohibitive to move off of Jira. Core to our beliefs is that people (and tools) work better when they're all in one place, so to serve these customers, we are building an excellent integration that makes GitLab work wonderfully alongside Jira. If and when customers are ready to migrate to GitLab issues, we also provide the tools and practices to help with that.

#### What is the difference between the Jira integration in Free and in Premium?

- **Short answer**: GitLab Premium and GitLab Ultimate provides more robust options for integration points, integration links, integration set up, sync frequency, and user authentication.
- **Update**: The end of the video discusses the Jira Development Panel as a differentiator. The Jira Development Panel integration has since moved to Core as of 13.4.

#### What are best practices for a developer workflow?

- **Short answer**: A few best practices:
  - Automate redundant tasks
  - Simplify and enable collaboration for stakeholders
  - Reduce time it takes to process information and data
  - Provide visibility to all stakeholders
  - Establish accountability

#### What are the differences around merge request approvals between the EE tiers?

- **Short answer**: GitLab Core does not have merge request (MR) approvals. In GitLab Free, there is one approval rule with any number of eligible approvers allowed to approve with the option to set eligible approvers in a codeowners file. In GitLab Premium, there are multiple approval rules with specific approvers (optional required approvers from codeowners file). And in GitLab Ultimate, security approvals are introduced as merge request (MR) approvals can be configured to require approval from a member of your security team when a merge request would introduce a security vulnerability or a software license compliance violation.

It is used in conjunction with [GitLab CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/features/continuous-integration/), the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab that coordinates the jobs. Find out more by reading the [GitLab Runner documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/).

#### What are best practices for a runner infrastructure?

- **Short answer**: Group runners are best for large projects (projects which use multiple repos) and multiple teams (top level groups provide isolation)

- **Short answer**: Coming soon
- **Context video**: Coming soon

### Secure

#### What are the GitLab security capabilities?

- **Short answer**: Shift left! Run application security scans in the Merge Requests so developers can address vulnerabilities quickly - that's what we mean by "DevSecOps" and the result is increased speed, efficiency, and security.

#### When will we no longer rely on using Docker-in-Docker (DinD) for security scanners?

- **Short answer**: As of 13.0, we no longer use DinD by default for security scanners. All 5 scanners (SAST, DAST, Container, License and Dependancy) are able to be run off-line as of GitLab 12.10.
