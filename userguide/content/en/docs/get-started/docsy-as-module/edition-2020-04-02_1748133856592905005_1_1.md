The main goal is to help you do your job better, faster, and smarter. For more information, [see this handbook page](/handbook/sales/field-communications/field-flash-newsletter/#overview). Now, without further ado...

### The GitLab Partner Program is here

This program will help us create partner-initiated sales opportunities and partner services that ultimately **drive greater value for our customers and GitLab**. To take full advantage of the program, you need to understand how it impacts you (i.e. new fields and processes in SFDC) and how you can best engage the channel & alliances team for partner opportunities. Check out:

- New and improved [Channel handbook page](/handbook/resellers/) - An overview of the program and all of the latest and greatest updates.
- Channel Operations Update [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kf1ofVydzIddoudVJDBuIPl6rIot_8DNOKWzYoNJN4M/edit#slide=id.g810ab95d82_0_594), [video](https://gitlab.zoom.us/rec/share/2_J1CLX72zlORJ3S0FzuQ7VxH5y1eaa81CJMrKIImB0ktTckBKmLLsekOwNB8IyB), and [handbook page](/handbook/resellers/) ¬†- Existing and new channel processes that impact day-to-day work.

### New and Noteworthy Resources üìì

COVID-19 has shaken up the way that many companies work, and we are in a unique position to help. Pick from the list of resources below, share with those who can benefit from it, lend a helping hand.

- [GitLab's Guide to All-Remote](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/guide/) - A comprehensive resource that highlights what "all-remote" really means and how we put it to practice.
- Need something shorter? Darren Murph's blog, [Resources for Companies Embracing Remote Work](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/03/06/resources-for-companies-embracing-remote-work/), is a quicker share.
- Video content? Here's [LinkedIn's interview with Sid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsLswGz6J5s&feature=youtu.be) about his tips for a productive all-remote workforce.

We have passed our SOC2 Type 1 audit and now have a report available to share with customers and any prospects covered under NDA.

There's a notable update to the [GitHub comparison page](https://web.archive.org/web/20240331181506/https://about.gitlab.com/competition/github/) that highlights GitHub Enterprise challenges in scaling, HA, and ZeroDowntime upgrades and contrasts how GitLab delivers those requirements. Also, check out these shiny new comparison pages:

- Buildkite: A continuous integration tool thats main value proposition is the ability to run multiple parallel tests that shorten time to deployment.
- LaunchDarkly: A feature delivery and feature management service offering.

### Did You Know? üî¢

New sales processes are in place that will allow us to standardize messaging around COVID-19 and the impact it's having on customers/prospects. [Read the new handbook section for full details on process changes](/handbook/sales/#corona-virus-impact-to-business-tracking) including:

- Add the string #covid in the SFDC Opportunity field [CP] Close Plan
- Assess and flag each SFDC Deal using the "COVID-19 Risk Scale" field

GitLab just released a new COVID-19 Medical Leave Policy that offers up to 12 weeks of leave with full pay to GitLab team members who are impacted.

- See the full policy or reach out to the Total Rewards team with questions.

### What's New in GitLab üöÄ

The GitLab 12.9 release just went live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:

- Reduce Security and Compliance Risk: Organizations storing secrets (anything they want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, or tokens) for infrastructure and applications centrally in Hashicorp Vault can now install it as a managed app at the project level - giving them enhanced security functionality.
- Increase Operational Efficiencies: Companies can now customize the stages in the Value Stream Analytics in order to visualize and manage their end-to-end workstreams in a way that makes sense to them and aligns with the right metrics for their business. Previously, the lifecycle stages were fixed to the DevOps loop, which may not be suitable for everyone.
- Deliver Better Products Faster: Organizations can now manage deploy tokens in bulk at the group level as well as create, list, and revoke deploy tokens via APIs - helping administrators manage authentication to the registry more efficiently.

[Visit the 12.9 Release Post for more details](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released/)
