## Introduction

1. This page is an extension of the [Support Engineering manager job family](/job-families/engineering/support-management/) page.
1. The **aim** of this page is to **help you know how to carry out your responsibilities as a Support Engineering Manager**.

## Support Leadership at GitLab

Leadership at GitLab is a unique opportunity to embody and model the GitLab Values. The responsibilities of Support Managers can be grouped into two broad categories:

| Responsibilities | GitLab Values |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Consistently ensure high Customer Support Satisfaction | Results, Efficiency, Iteration, Transparency |
| Support and nurture team members in Customer Support and SGG (Support Global Groups) | Collaboration, Diversity Inclusion Belonging |

Our [Hazards and Challenges page](/handbook/support/managers/hazards-and-challenges) describes some known issues and how we handle them.

## Consistently ensure high Customer Support Satisfaction

Our primary responsibility in the Support Leadership team is to ensure high quality Customer Support for GitLab customers. To fulfill this responsibility we set and achieve goals (aligned with GitLab Strategy and Engineering [OKRs](/handbook/company/okrs/)), and ensure Support Engineers can achieve *their* goals.

### Working in Slack

Ask and answer questions in Slack. (We don't have a way to easily track this, but feel free to share things you're proud of in 1:1 notes documents.)

Important Slack channels:

1. `#support_leadership`
1. `#support_ticket-attention-requests`
1. `#spt_hiring`
1. `#support_team_chat`
1. `#thanks`
1. `#team-member-updates`
1. `#managers`
1. `#eng-managers`

### Conducting weekly 1:1 meetings

Weekly 1:1 meetings are a crucial part of Remote Culture at GitLab. Refer to the [Support Engineer Responsibilities page](/handbook/support/support-engineer-responsibilities) to understand what your team members are aiming to achieve.

1. [Review at least two tickets per team-member in 1:1 calls](/handbook/support/workflows/working-on-tickets#1-weekly-ticket-review). This helps maintain and improve quality (technical, communication and collaboration).
1. Monitor for team members to have [around 50% to 60% of public replies to be on tickets that are assigned to them](/handbook/support/workflows/working-on-tickets#2-public-replies-on-your-assigned-tickets). Assigning tickets helps resolve customer problems quickly and efficiently as well as encouraging learning and collaboration.
1. Help ensure your team members [meet the ticket baseline](/handbook/support/workflows/working-on-tickets#3-meet-the-ticket-baseline) for solved tickets, public replies, and internal notes for the type of tickets they are working on. This encourages the even distribution of ticket volume across the team.
1. Review notable Incidents/Emergencies and Customer Calls in 1:1 notes/meetings with your team members.
1. Discuss [career development](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/) plans with team members at least once per quarter.

### Develop your skills through learning and training

We are committed to helping you develop your skills through continuous learning. The GitLab [Learning and Development team](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/) provides opportunities for exploration and training.

Be sure to include non-technical topics such as:

1. [Psychological safety in teams](/handbook/leadership/emotional-intelligence/psychological-safety/)
1. Time management
1. [Leadership skills](/handbook/leadership/)
1. [Coaching skills](/handbook/leadership/coaching/)
1. [Diversity, inclusion, and belonging](/handbook/company/culture/inclusion/)
1. [Remote work](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/)
1. Trends and insights in the larger support world

Consider participating in [Team Member Resource Groups](/handbook/company/culture/inclusion/erg-guide/), and ensure your team members know about these.

Consider participating in, creating, or publicizing a [GitLab Book Club](/handbook/leadership/book-clubs/).

Support Engineers and Managers are also encouraged to complete courses and certification from external providers. Speak with your manager to plan your learning goals.

### Develop your skills through direct interactions with customers and Support Engineers

We are committed to being managers who [*know and understand what Support Engineers do day to day.*](/handbook/leadership/no-matrix-organization/).

The best way to be familiar with Support Engineer workflows and responsibilities is to step into the shoes of the engineers.

Each week, Support Managers should do one or more of these activities:

- own and resolve one ticket from first reply to closing statement
- join a pairing session with one or more Support Engineers
- join a scheduled or emergency call

By continually engaging with workflows, tickets, and customers we can build empathy and understand pain points through first-hand experience.

In this way, we build trust with engineers and customers while creating a sense of psychological safety by demonstrating that it's okay not to know.
