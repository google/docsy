## Retrospective

### VPE

- GOOD
  - Q2 OKRS launched on time
  - Hiring plan and budget on-time and in-line
  - Hired and on boarded a director of eng (Tommy)
  - Q1 GitLab.com availability/stability was good (although not as good as monitoring indicates)
- BAD
  - OKRs we tweaked mid-quarter and Sid and I never syncd on the changes, so some things never got attention
  - GitLab.com did not move to GCP
  - Didn't get to the local handbook set up video
  - Slow progress overall on hiring
- TRY
  - Double down on hiring Dir of Infra, treat as exec hired
  - Partner with people ops to increase hiring pace
  - Less KRs in Q2 to increase focus

### Platform

- GOOD
  - Deliverable hit rate has been pretty consistent.
  - We resolved all Security SL1 issues.
  - We triaged all Platform Community Contribution MRs.
- BAD
  - We consistently overpromised what we could deliver in a release. This was done in accordance with earlier statements that OKRs should be ambitious and that if we hit more than 70% of our OKRs, we weren't ambituous enough, though.
  - We did not resolve all Support SP1 and Availability AP1 issues.
  - We didn't take over any of the [popular "coach will finish" Community Contribution MRs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16yx8B0Oio_EWEynVrZFEejX9OYDfTTkzBltpbXhxefU/edit#gid=0).
  - We didn't hit our bug target, and actually fixed fewer bugs with each release.
  - Bug target was too low. If we had hit our target, the total backlog size would have stayed approximately constant, but because we didn't, it actually increased by 17.
  - Not much progress was made on backup/restore integration tests.
- TRY
  - Putting a limit on the total weight of Deliverable issues so that we can actually deliver all of them, and using the Stretch label for issues we'd like to start on this release, but are fine with letting them slip and get finished in the following release. (See [gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com#2022](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/2022))
  - Specifically allocating time to finish popular Community Contribution MRs, by making their issues Deliverable and not allowing them to slip.
  - Specifically allocating time for Engineering-driven efforts like improving integration tests, by making their issues Deliverable and not allowing them to slip.
  - Finding a better balance between adding new features and fixing bugs in existing features.
  - Adding people to the team to be able to do the 3 items above without significantly interfering with our Product feature output.

### Discussion

- GOOD
  - All top-priority security, support, and availability issues were addressed.
  - Deliverable hit percentage increased to 100% over the quarter.
  - Hit bugs target early.
- BAD
  - Missed a big issue (Rails 5), due to staff changes.
  - Bug target was too low (backlog only reduced by 11 issues).
  - Didn't address all of the oldest community contributions we have.
  - Deliverables target ignores an issue, batch commenting, that has been blocked on frontend since January.
- TRY
  - Not having OKRs for specific priorities, if we also have OKRs for solving issues of a particular type.
  - Better tracking of issues that made it / missed per release:
    - All backend issues.
    - Deliverables.
    - Bugs
    - Performance issues.

### Distribution

- GOOD
  - Delivered all scheduled OKRs, and added one more during the quarter
  - Recognized challenging parts of the tasks and reduced scope in time, which allowed us to move quicker towards the goals
  - Managed to tackle some Technical Debt as part of the OKR tasks
- BAD
  - Everything that was not an OKR was secondary
  - The scope of the OKR's might have been too ambitious
  - Basic integration coverage meant that we had two serious regressions
  - Cloud Native charts taking most of the teams bandwidth
  - Less amount of time spent on hiring than what was expected
- TRY
  - Establish a better ratio of technical debt vs. features shipped in one release
  - Focus on sourcing more candidates
  - Establish a better way of assigning engineers to their tasks instead of encouraging them to choose from milestone

### Monitoring

- GOOD
  - Shipped all GCP required features.
- BAD
  - Dropped/didn't update alerting KR to refelect feature scheduling changes.
- TRY
  - Work on hiring to improve team throughput.

### UX Design

- GOOD
  - Major challenges/opportunities for Auto DevOps installation flow identified.
  - Roadmap for Auto DevOps installation immprovements established.
  - All design pattern issues completed or in final review.
  - Understand who operations/DevOps engineers are, most common tasks/duties, the metrics they're tracking.
  - Identified DevOps biggest challenges: lack of automation, culture, resource, and tools.
  - Updated and recorded all UX standards covered by the current UX guide.
  - Added many UX standards not documented in the current UX guide.
- BAD
  - OKRs for Q1 not finalized in December and re-tuned at the end of January, delaying progress.
  - Hiring took up much of the UX team's time early in Q1.
  - Poor priority management, put design library issues off as the deadline was further out and other OKRs were more pressing for the company.
  - Dependence on other departments for scheduling and review of some issues. Unable to influence progress once they were out of our hands.
- TRY
  - Finalize OKRs earlier on so we can plan better.
  - Assign UX designer to issues rather than encouraging them to pick them up.
  - Schedule UX OKR issues into milestones to make sure we stay on track.
  - Continue to use epics to drive goals and initiatives.
  - Streamline the hiring process for UX to make it more efficient.

### Support Engineering

- GOOD
  - New hires on boarded quickly and successfully
  - Services is gelling
  - HA & Kubernetes expertises went well
  - No attrition
- BAD
  - We did not hire to 100% of plan
  - SLAs for premium and ultimate fell short of our standard
- TRY
  - Hire a director of support
  - Pick up pace of engineer and agent hiring

### Security

- GOOD
  - Resolved all SL1/SL open issues in CE tracker.
  - Conducted successful security assessment on Gitaly.
  - Mean Time To Remediation for new open security vulnerabilities is now below industry standard of 30 days.
  - Started conducting internal security briefings on a biweekly basis to drive company-wide accountability and sense of urgency on all security issues.
  - Successfully drove GitLab's new pages domain verification mechanism.
  - From a technical security standpoint, completed all requirements for GDPR compliance.
  - There is now a formal data classification policy.
- BAD
  - Although we are doing well with new open security vulnerability issues, there remains a security debt of old security issues to resolve.
  - FIPS 140-2 effort needs more work, and we did not get as far along in that process as we wanted to, due to reliance on 3rd party partner.
  - We were not able to get as far along in application security reviews, due to other efforts taking higher priority (e.g., remediating new open issues, security release process efforts).
- TRY
  - Revisit FIPS 140-2 effort to see how we can take on more of the burden internally.
  - We will work to reduce security debt in the old open security issues.
  - Conduct more outreach to Engineering departments in order to get more application security reviews conducted.

### Frontend

- GOOD
  - New team members were overall onboarded well
  - Reduced Technical Debt a lot through different topics
  - Constant improvements on our workflows and tools
  - Delivered a lot of big features
- BAD
  - Missed the deliverable percentage goals
  - Vue-based MR's not live yet. This turned out to be far larger than anticipated and had to be re-planned.
  - Too long and too much discussions for specific topics
  - CSS Refactoring underestimated, had to re-plan
  - Hard to estimate velocity, lead to slipped deliverables
  - Hard to schedule with an unclear task at the beginning
  - Didn't invest enough time on Community Contributions
- TRY
  - Drive longer planning with Epics + bigger scheduling gates for issues
  - Optimise planning pipeline together with PM's
  - Domain experts to take over domain expertise in the FE team
  - Frontend Sub teams
  - Skipping CSS Refactor and go straight for reusable Vue Components
  - Extend tooling and improve Workflows
  - Set up a workflow to check community contributions as an actual task by someone every release cycle

### Infrastructure

- GOOD
  - We simplified the GCP project by moving to a life-and-shift strategy
- BAD
  - Hiring did not keep pace
  - We do not have a project management framework that has taken
- TRY
  - Pick up hiring
  - Experiment with project management frameworks
  - Better monitoring of GitLab.com for SLA

### Database

- GOOD
  - We managed to achieve more compared to our previous OKR, both by having more manpower and by planning work more carefully.
- BAD
  - We didn't get as much workflow related work (e.g. Apdex scores) done as we'd like.
- TRY
  - For the next quarter we will be hiring a database manager and hopefully also a database engineer. This should further reduce load on the existing team members.

### Production

- GOOD
  - GitLab.com availability in Q1 was better than 2017 average
- BAD
  - Team attrition
  - Did not move to GCP
  - Did not hire a production engineer
- TRY
  - Better GitLab.com monitoring for uptime

### Gitaly

- GOOD
  - Hit early milestones
- BAD
  - We did not stay on pace with our backlog for Gitaly v1.0
  - OKRs were messy and possibly redundant
- TRY
  - More project mgmt
  - Clearer KR, less for more focus?

### Geo

- GOOD
  - We migrated most projects, attachments, LFS objects, etc. from GitLab.com to Google using Geo.
  - We found and fixed a significant amount of issues in this process.
  - We reduced the number of out of sync/failed repository syncs from over a million to less than a few hundred.
  - Geo appears to be keeping up with the new data pushed to GitLab.com.
  - Customers appear to be using Geo more, helping us find additional issues.
- BAD
  - We have yet to do a thorough project-by-project verification of data mirrored from GitLab.com.
  - Our verification implementation only covers basic references, but does not check the integrity of the files themselves.
  - We still have a lot of obscenely slow database queries causing high load on the database.
  - We have not made much progress in putting hashed storage into production.
- TRY
  - Start using our repository checksum feature when 10.7 is deployed.
  - Improve verification to include object integrity.
  - Spending Q2 optimizing these database queries.
  - Assign someone to own the rollout of hashed storage.

### Security Products

- GOOD
  - Whole (new) Team onboarded with success
  - Ability to release since the first milestone
  - Openshift to GCP migration is going well
  - Lot of expectations for security features

- BAD
  - Each change in the jobs definition means updating docs everywhere, our `.gitlab-ci.yml`, and possibly introducing break changes. This process is long and error prone.
  - Dependence on other departments, especially Frontend, for implementation on some issues.
  - Lack of automated E2E tests/QA so long and painful testing for now
  - We hit the limitations of our own features (using subgroups, .gitlab-ci.yml include, unprotected container registry, etc.).
  - Lot of processes to assimilate, as the whole team is new
  - Small usage of Security Products so few feedback

- TRY
  - Improve our tools for security advisories triage.
  - Improve usage of our tools internaly
  - Improve accessibility to our tools (includes in gitlab-ci.yml)
