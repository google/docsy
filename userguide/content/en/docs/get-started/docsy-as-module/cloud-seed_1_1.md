## ‚õÖüå± Cloud Seed

GitLab is the one DevOps platform. Teams use GitLab (SaaS or self-managed) for development, planning, collaboration and automation. However, digital transformation is incomplete without cloud adoption.

Thus, Cloud Seed ‚Äî a collaboration with Google Cloud ‚Äî makes it trivial to consume cloud services from GitLab.

### Capabilities

#### Generate Google Cloud Service Accounts

- Service accounts are authentication credentials that can be generated from the GitLab web interface
- Used for a wide range of integrations and automation with Google Cloud services

#### Deploy to Google Cloud Run

- Cloud Run is a fully managed deployment platform for containerized applications
- Setup automated deployments to Cloud Run via the GitLab web interface including support for _Preview Environments_
- Every Git commit, branch and tag is automatically deployed to the appropriate Cloud Run service environment

#### Provision Google Cloud SQL databases

- Provision popular database instances easily from the GitLab web interface
- Support all major versions of PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL Service
- Generate instances, databases and users to be used with deployment and test automations
- Environment (i.e. Git ref) aware database provisioning

### Usecases

- Cloud native development with automated deployments to Cloud Run
- Cloud migration and app modernization with Cloud SQL relational databases
