GitLab built a comprehensive course on remote work leadership which is hosted on a leading online learning platform, [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The course, titled “**[How to Manage a Remote Team](https://www.coursera.org/learn/remote-team-management)**,” provides a holistic, in-depth analysis of remote team structures, phases of adaptation, and best practices for managers, leaders, and human resources professionals. It is offered free of charge, with an optional certificate available for $49.

This course is ideal for current managers, executives, and human resources professionals who want to learn how to lead and support a high-functioning, scalable remote team. GitLab is one of the world’s largest all-remote organizations; experts from throughout the company will guide you through in-depth lessons for leaders, people managers, and HR professionals to build, manage, and scale.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Lead in a remote environment
- Build a remote organizational culture and practices
- Assess teams’ and managers’ readiness and preparation for remote work
- Create a foundational strategy for executing a remote transformation

For the final project in this course, you will create a real or hypothetical strategic plan to transition a team to remote operation. You will assess your organization's remote maturity and infrastructure, and identify the best team structure for remote operation — including determining whether to use an all-remote or remote-friendly model. You'll outline plans for documentation, education, leadership, and equipment or resource needs for your unique organization.

This is an intermediate-level course, intended for learners who have previous experience managing or leading people. To succeed in this course, you should have at least one year of management experience. No remote experience is required.
