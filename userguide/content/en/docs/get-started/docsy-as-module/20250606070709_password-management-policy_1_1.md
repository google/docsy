## 1. Introduction

At Green Orbit Digital, the protection of our sensitive business data and personal information relies heavily on secure password practices. With the increasing threat of cybercrime, particularly the harvesting of usernames, passwords, and financial details, strong password management is essential. Criminals exploit weak passwords to launch attacks, steal identities, and disrupt operations.

This Password Policy outlines our approach to creating, managing, storing, and sharing passwords securely. It combines best practice guidelines with our mandatory use of 1Password, our trusted password management platform.

## 2. Purpose

This policy is designed to:

- Ensure strong, secure password practices are consistently followed.

- Protect Green Orbit Digital’s digital assets, systems, and sensitive information.

- Establish clear guidelines for generating, managing, storing, and sharing passwords.

- Promote secure behaviours that mitigate the risk of password-related breaches.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and third parties who access Green Orbit Digital’s systems, networks, and data—whether using company-issued or personal devices for work purposes.

## 4. Understanding the Importance of Password Security

Passwords are valuable targets for criminals. Stolen credentials can be used for:

- Fraudulent purchases and identity theft.

- Unauthorised access to systems.

- Launching additional attacks.

- Selling on criminal marketplaces.

Statistics:

According to Breach Alarm, over one million passwords are stolen every week. Cybercriminals use automated systems to rapidly attempt combinations of usernames and passwords across many platforms ("credential stuffing").

To defend against these threats, we must adopt robust password hygiene practices.

## 5. Password Creation Guidelines

When creating passwords:

- Length and Complexity: Passwords must be at least 12 characters long, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

- Avoid Personal Information: Never include identifiable information (e.g., names, birthdays, favourite sports teams).

- Use Passphrases: Prefer longer passphrases (e.g., combinations of random words) that are easy to remember but difficult to guess.

- Unique Passwords for Each Account: Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts, especially critical or sensitive ones.

- Change Default Credentials: Always replace manufacturer-default usernames and passwords immediately.

## 6. Password Storage and Management

- Use of 1Password: All work-related credentials must be securely stored in 1Password, our designated password manager.

- Password Vaults: Every employee must maintain a secure vault for storing passwords. Personal accounts used for work purposes should also be stored securely.

- Master Password: Your 1Password master password must be strong and must never be shared.

## 7. Password Sharing Practices

- Secure Sharing: If passwords must be shared, only 1Password’s secure sharing function must be used.

- No Unencrypted Transmission: Passwords must never be shared via email, text messages, or unencrypted methods.

- Access Control: Share access only with those who require it. Permissions must be reviewed regularly.

Remember: Sharing usernames and passwords outside secure systems undermines accountability and increases risk.

## 8. Password Maintenance and Updates

- Regular Updates: Update passwords at least every 90 days for critical accounts.

- Immediate Changes for Compromised Accounts: If you suspect a password has been compromised, change it immediately and report the incident to IT.

- 1Password Prompts: Follow prompts from 1Password suggesting when to change weak or reused passwords.

## 9. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Mandatory MFA: MFA must be enabled wherever possible, especially on critical systems and high-risk accounts.

- 1Password Support: 1Password supports MFA, and all employees are encouraged to activate it for all supported accounts.

MFA significantly strengthens account security by requiring a second method of verification beyond just the password.

## 10. Password Recovery and Emergency Access

- Lost Passwords: Employees should follow 1Password’s secure recovery procedures if they forget their master password or experience access issues.

- Emergency Procedures: IT has established a secure process for emergency access to critical accounts, with full documentation of any access provided.

## 11. Account Lockout and Monitoring

- Lockout Protocol: Multiple unsuccessful login attempts will trigger account lockouts. Contact IT to regain access.

- Monitoring: Login attempts and account activities are regularly monitored to detect suspicious behaviour and protect our systems.

## 12. Training and Awareness

- Employee Training: All employees must complete training on secure password creation, 1Password usage, and overall password hygiene.

- Continuous Awareness: Green Orbit Digital will provide regular updates, reminders, and best practice guidance regarding password security.

## 13. Compliance and Auditing

- Regular Audits: The IT department will perform regular audits of password practices and 1Password usage.

- Non-Compliance: Breaches of this policy may result in disciplinary action, including loss of system access or, in serious cases, termination of employment.

## 14. Policy Review and Updates

This policy will be reviewed annually, or more frequently if necessary, in response to changes in technology, security threats, or business needs. Updates will be communicated to all employees.

## 15. Conclusion

By following this Password Policy, Green Orbit Digital strengthens its defence against cyber threats and protects the integrity of our operations. The adoption of 1Password ensures that passwords are stored securely, shared safely, and managed efficiently across the organisation.
