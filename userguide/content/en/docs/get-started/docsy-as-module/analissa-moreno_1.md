### About Me

Hi, I'm Analissa, but you can call me Ana! I'm a Salesforce Release Engineer based in Austin, Texas with a background in Salesforce administration, process optimization, and change management. My work revolves around ensuring smooth deployments, maintaining system integrity, and continuously improving our release processes. I'm also a three-time Certified Salesforce Administrator, so safe to say I love Salesforce.

I thrive in problem-solving environments, where I can experiment, refine, and iterate to find the best solutions. I believe in balancing structure with adaptability—having a solid process while staying flexible when new challenges arise.

Outside of work, I enjoy running & cycling, spending time with my dog Rollei, and exploring creative side projects.

### My GitLab Story

My journey with GitLab started when I transitioned into a Release Engineering role, bringing my experience as a Salesforce Administrator into a space where DevOps and process optimization intersect. I'm passionate about building efficient, scalable processes and ensuring that teams can deploy changes with confidence.

As someone who enjoys continuous learning, I've been deepening my knowledge of release management, DevOps methodologies, and CI/CD processes. I'm particularly interested in streamlining deployments, enhancing automation, and driving consistency across environments.

### My Working Style

- **Proactive over Reactive** – I believe in planning ahead to anticipate challenges and mitigate risks before they become issues. The more we plan, the better the outcome and the lower the risk.
- **Hands-On & Iterative** – I learn best by doing and refining as I go. I don't expect perfection on the first try, but I do aim for continuous improvement. I like to test solutions, gather feedback, and make adjustments based on what works best.
- **Structured but Adaptable** – I appreciate clear frameworks and processes, but recognize that flexibility is essential for growth. If something isn't working, I'm quick to pivot and adjust.
- **Big-Picture Thinker with Attention to Detail** – I like understanding the "why" behind a process and how it fits into the larger system while ensuring the finer details are handled effectively.
- **Independent but Collaborative** – I'm comfortable working autonomously and taking ownership of my projects, but also value collaboration, brainstorming, and knowledge-sharing.
- **Precision & Accuracy Over Vagueness** – I prefer clarity in communication and execution. I value precise details over broad generalizations to ensure alignment and efficiency. The more clear your directives, the better output you will receive from me.
- **Work Smarter, Not Harder** – I prioritize efficiency and finding optimized solutions. If there's a way to streamline a process or reduce unnecessary complexity, I'll seek it out to improve workflows without sacrificing quality.

### Communication Style

- **Direct & Solution-Oriented** – I appreciate clear, concise communication that focuses on solutions. If something needs to be fixed, I'd rather address it early and work toward a resolution.
- **Asynchronous & Thoughtful** – I prefer async communication whenever possible, giving space for deep work and thoughtful responses. If something is urgent, I appreciate a ping to bring it to my attention.
- **Feedback-Friendly** – I welcome feedback and see it as an opportunity for growth. If something can be improved, I'd rather know sooner than later.
- **Context Matters** – When discussing issues or decisions, I appreciate background information to understand the full picture. If I ask a lot of questions, it's because I want to ensure alignment and clarity.

### Current Projects

- Evaluating a Salesforce-specific CI/CD solution to improve release efficiency and lower bug introductions.
