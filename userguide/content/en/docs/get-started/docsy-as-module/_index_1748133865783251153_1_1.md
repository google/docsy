## Introduction

Localization team collaborates with the Marketing, Sales, Product and Engineering [divisions](/handbook/company/structure/#organizational-structure), as well as external partners (vendors) and the wider community of translators, to enable GitLab's global  reach and user experience across key pillars: Marketing (about.gitlab.com), Editorial (blogs), Product, Documentation, and Enablement (support, customer success, etc.).

The key initiatives around strategic localization of content and materials include increasing our non-English blog publishing cadence and performance, enabling localization of docs.gitlab.com, launching our comprehensive terminology management system, deploying cutting-edge Generative AI and machine translation solutions, and expanding into customer-facing programs including Support content localization and training & certification materials. 

Our ability to support regional teams with localized product documentation, marketing content, and customer success materials directly impacts GitLab's ability to grow in international markets.

## Localization Processes

**Primary Method**
Submit an issue through our [Localization Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=localization-request) when your content is ready for localization or review.

**Additional Support**
For general localization questions:

- Join our `#localization` Slack channel
- Add the L10n-attention label to issues, epics, or merge requests
- Here you can view the status of current localization requests: [Issue Tracker Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/localization/issue-tracker/-/boards/7726880)

Note: While you can contact the Translated or Argos Multilingual team directly via Slack, we prefer submission through the Issue Tracker.

### When to engage with us

We recommend connecting with the Localization team early in your project, especially for global initiatives affecting users across all regions that have a specific timeline. While we can't begin translations until content is finalized and approved, early collaboration during planning and ideation will ensure success.

### Internal Reviews

We are currently moving the internal review process over to language leads and contractors, so that our in-market GitLab teams can focus on their normal duties. Please note, however, that we may need to engage the internal review team from time to time, as our new teams ramp up and build the context they need to successfully localize our content in a way that aligns to GitLab and local expectations.

At the moment, our internal reviewers are volunteers. We completely appreciate that this task is on top of your day job and will continue to respect that. Both translation and reviews are conducted in Translated tooling; processes for review are currently a work in progress.

## Marketing Localization

Our website is now available in 6 languages. While we're still in the process polishing existing page translations and expanding into getting more parts of the website localized, you can verify what translated pages are live on production by viewing our Buyer Experience sitemap @ https://about.gitlab.com/buyer-experience/sitemap.xml.

The translated congent of our website pages is stored across our CMS and the Buyer Experience repository:

- German: [buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content/de-de](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content/de-de)
- French: [buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content/fr-fr](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content/fr-fr)
- Japanese:[buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content/ja-jp](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content/ja-jp)
- Spanish [buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content/es](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content/es)
- Italian [buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content/it-it](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content/it-it)
- Brazilian-Portuguese [buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content/pt-br](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/tree/main/content/pt-br)

You can go to the [Digital Experience's Localization Best Practices team Handbook page](/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/engineering/localization/) for further technical details on localizing content.

### Translating content for campaigns

The Integrated Marketing team typically drives which translations are required, based on current campaigns and regional need. Localized campaigns currently follow the [integrated campaign process](/handbook/marketing/campaigns/#campaign-planning). The Integrated Marketing team is responsible for content localization for integrated campaigns.

### Language preference segmentation

In order to offer content and events in preferred languages where available, we have a `Language Preference` Segmentation created in Marketo. Only Marketing Ops can edit these segments. Available languages for this segmentation can be found on the [Marketo page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#segmentations). A person will be added to a `Language Preference` segment if they complete a form on our website or respond to a campaign that was offered in one of the available languages.

### Translated URL structure

All translated pages live in a sub-folder dedicated to a specific language. These sub-folders use [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

### hreflang tagging

Search engines use the `hreflang` tag to determine a canonical version for translated pages. We'll use `hreflang` on our translated pages.

`hreflang` tags start with declaration `<link rel="alternate"`, adds URL `href={{url}}`, and ends with `hreflang={{language ISO}}`

Example of a hreflang tag for a URL translated to German.

`<link rel="alternate" href="https://about.gitlab.com/de-de/warum/nutze-continuous-integration-fuer-schnelleres-bauen-und-testen/" hreflang="de" />`

The canonical version of our site will the United States English version on `about.gitlab.com`. We need to add all versions of a page under the page title and link to each one with the appropriate language noted. [Google provides this example](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/localized-versions?visit_id=637504000817145606-3833240924&rd=1):

```html
<head>
 <title>Widgets, Inc</title>
  <link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-gb"
       href="https://en-gb.example.com/page.html" />
  <link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-us"
       href="https://en-us.example.com/page.html" />
  <link rel="alternate" hreflang="en"
       href="https://en.example.com/page.html" />
  <link rel="alternate" hreflang="de"
       href="https://de.example.com/page.html" />
 <link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default"
       href="https://www.example.com/" />
</head>
```

It's important to note we need to declare the default page from our repository as the canonical version to avoid penalties across Google properties.

Aleyda Solis maintains a great [tool to build `hreflang` tags](https://www.aleydasolis.com/english/international-seo-tools/hreflang-tags-generator/) we can use for reference as well.
