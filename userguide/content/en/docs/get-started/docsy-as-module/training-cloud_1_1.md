## Overview

The demo systems that we call the GitLab Training Cloud provides a perpetual shared GitLab instance that is used for Professional Services training classes and field marketing enablement workshops with hands-on lab scenarios. The GitLab Training Cloud is comparable to our hosted gitlab.com SaaS service, however it allows greater flexibility for demonstration and sandbox purposes without affecting our production environment.

The GitLab Training Cloud provides you access to Ultimate license features with your own user account and an organizational group that you can use for creating projects and child groups. We also handle all of the GitLab Runner autoscaling and Kubernetes configuration behind the scenes.
