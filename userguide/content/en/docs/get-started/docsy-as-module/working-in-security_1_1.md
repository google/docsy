## Security Hiring

The company-wide mandate is justification for mapping Security headcount to around 5% of total company headcount. Tying Security Department growth headcount to 5% of total company headcount ensures adequate staffing support for the following (below are highlights and not the entire list of responsibilities of the Security Department):

- Security releases. At GitLab, the Security Department is DRI for critical and non-critical security releases.
- Detection/response for security incidents, which will increase as GitLab.com users increase.
- Preparation for becoming a public company.
- Running the GitLab public bug bounty program.
- Dogfooding and contributing to our product.
- Improving and maintaining the security of GitLab.com and related services.

## Career Development and Opportunities at GitLab

Career opportunities at GitLab, personal growth, and development are important and encouraged. Security team members and managers are encouraged to use [Individual Development Plans]({{< ref "individual-development-plan" >}}) to help foster, guide, and assist with career growth.
