## Overview

Rattle is primarily used by our Solutions Architects for [activity capture](/handbook/solutions-architects/processes/activity-capture/) to capture customer calls, efficiently log them, and run reporting in Salesforce and our BI tool. Rattle replaced Troops.ai in January of 2024.

   1. Add user to #rattle-users in Slack
   1. All workflows in Rattle are based on Salesforce Role, not the user's name, so there is no action needed on workflows when a new hire starts.
