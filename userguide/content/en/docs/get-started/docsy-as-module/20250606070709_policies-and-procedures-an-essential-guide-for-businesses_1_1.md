### Summary

Build a solid foundation for organizational standards with this guide. Covering the essentials, it shows you practical steps for creating clear policies and procedures.

Policies and procedures are essential for any company from the start. You can think of them as guiding documents that clearly describe your company’s best practices, values, and operational standards. By defining these properly, you cut down on a lot of ambiguity and keep your company professional and organized.

Below, we’ll explain to you how exactly policies and procedures work, including their different types, and then walk you through a step-by-step process for writing them, complete with handy resources.

## What are policies and procedures?

Policy and procedures detail the way a company or organization should be run.

Policies are high-level statements that direct the “what and “why” of the company, and they’re usually written by the CEO, president, or board of directors. They lay down rules and standards based on the organization’s mission and values, setting the stage for the direction of the company.

On the other hand, procedures outline how exactly the policies will be implemented, in the form of detailed, step-by-step instructions. They include standardized workflows where you make it clear who’s responsible for which steps.

Here’s an example:

- Policy: The company is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all employees.

- Procedure: Employees should report any workplace hazards or injuries to their manager right away. First aid kids are placed in the break room, copy room, and on each floor, and there should be specific plans for emergency situations, like fires.

Together, policies and procedures work hand in hand so employees are aware of exactly what is expected of them. It’s an expected practice to write them down clearly, often in a manual, and then introduce them to employees in detail during onboarding.

## Benefits of policies and procedures

A report from Harvard Business Review suggests improving efficiency in a business or organization by making sure all employees know what they need to do when carrying out their daily work. Policies and procedures aim to do exactly that, ensuring consistency across departments and locations. This can help reduce errors and increase efficiency.

They also act as a decision-making and strategic guide for your company, and employees can always refer to them in new situations. This is especially relevant when the company has to scale or expand into new markets since having clear policies and procedures can prevent contradictory decisions.

## Common types of policies in organizations

Before we break down how to write your own policies and procedures, let’s take a quick look first at the types of policies that companies usually have. These are just a few:

- Code of conduct – Outlines the expected behavior and ethical standards for all employees, including professional conduct and conflicts of interest

- Human resources – Covers areas like hiring and onboarding, compensation and benefits, performance management, employee leave, and termination procedures

- Information security – Sets guidelines for protecting the organization’s sensitive information and data, including data access, storage, and handling

- Health and safety – Ensures a safe working environment for employees by addressing safety measures, accident prevention, and emergency response procedures

- Diversity and inclusion – May cover topics like equal opportunity, non-discrimination, and employee resource groups

- Financial – Establishes guidelines for financial management, including budgeting, spending approvals, expense reimbursement, and financial reporting

- Customer service – Defines the organization’s approach to customer engagement, such as service standards, complaint handling, and customer privacy

- Environmental – Shows the organization’s commitment to environmental sustainability and describes how to manage its environmental impact, such as through waste reduction and energy efficiency

## How do you write effective policies and procedures?

Policy and procedure manuals can take a long time to develop and perfect, but you can expedite the experience by following a few developmental and structural steps in writing them.

Here are the major steps for writing effective policies and procedures:

### Step 1: Prepare to write

You can make your policy and procedure manual more efficient by treating the activity like a project and ensuring you get management support. That way, time and resources will be available to you. Because policies and procedures often involve legal and regulatory consequences, you also need to consider having documents reviewed by legal counsel.

### Step 2: Have a clear understanding of what your company’s policies are.

Having a vision for your company is vital to keeping the project focused. This vision helps you craft an appropriate template for your field or industry that will help you gain a better understanding of what content you need to add.

### Step 3: Write your documents

To write your documents, start by reading current policies and procedures if any exist, and review any compliance or regulatory guidelines that apply. It’s essential to consult the people who will use the procedures and perform the work, so they understand the steps in a workflow, especially when creating procedures.

Similarly, consulting employees on the creation of documentation is one of the best methods for ensuring their interest in and use of procedures.

### Step 4: Implement the policies and procedures

To encourage the success of a document, plan its implementation. Publish the document in one central location, such as on a company website, and employees should sign and send alerts when they have read the document to verify retention.

### Step 5: Create a training plan to support the new policies and procedures

Then, establish a review cycle so that new regulations and practices can be incorporated into your documents to keep them relevant.

## Tips for making your policies and procedures easily executable

When you’re writing a policy or procedure template, you want to make sure it’s easy to read, understand and follow. Here are some tips for making your template as clear and helpful as possible:

### 1. Pick the right template

It’s important to choose a template that is specific to those fields. For example, if your company works in the finance industry and you need to create a policy that keeps track of all your employees’ expenses, then you should choose an appropriate template for your field or industry.

The same thing goes for quality and safety management. In this case, it’s important to choose a template that works best for your company

### 2. Keep it brief

If you can fit all of the information on one page, then it’s highly recommended. It’s easier on the reader’s eyes and your team will be able to find what they’re looking for faster. If you need more space than one page, use bullet points to break up long paragraphs without making the document look too complicated or intimidating to help new hires get started quicker.

Adding headers is also ideal if you want to let readers know what type of content they’re about to read before they even start reading it so they can decide whether or not this document is relevant to them right away. They don’t need to scroll through everything before finding out what’s important to do in this task.

### 3. Track the system

For example, if you’re working in quality management and safety, there are several different types of templates available. However, choosing one that has been customized for your industry or field will ensure that it contains all the information you need for your policies and procedures.

### 4. Avoid using jargon

Use language and tone appropriate to your audience. For example, writing policy and procedure documents for a manufacturing company would have a different language than one for a retail company or an educational institution.

Use terms and definitions consistently throughout your document. This helps readers understand what each term means when they see it in multiple places throughout the document.

If there are any terms that are unique to your organization or industry, be sure that they’re defined at the beginning of the document so people don’t have to look up what they mean later on in the text if they don’t already know them.

It also helps to explain acronyms where appropriate, so readers aren’t left wondering what terms like “ISO 9001” mean when they see it again later on in an unrelated section of text.

### 5. Make the tone fit

Make sure the tone fits with the purpose of your policy or procedure. For example, if you’re writing policy and procedure documents on fire safety, you don’t need to use overly formal language.

You should also consider who will be reading it – if it’s someone who has never worked for your company before, then using plain language will help them understand what they need to do and why it is important.

## Why use templates for policies and procedures?

When creating policies and procedures, it’s common to use a template or predetermined layout for efficiency. This way, you can simply fill it out and get a polished, organized document. Here are the benefits:

- They help solve urgent business problems quicker and error-free.

- They reduce the time and effort that would otherwise be spent on drafting a policy and procedure manual.

- They keep all policies and procedures in one place, which makes them easy to find.

- They boost employee work efficiency.

- They help in planning, organizing, and creating a formal structure for each project.

- They keep track of tasks and milestones, assign resources, set deadlines, and generate reports from any task or project within minutes using earned value analysis reports.

- They capture and store all important information about a task or project using a built-in CRM that allows you to easily track your progress.

- They show you how much work has been completed on each task so far compared to its budgeted cost at completion (BAC).

## Frequently asked questions

What’s the difference between a policy and a procedure?

A policy is a broad statement that outlines the company’s values, expectations, and high-level standards, usually to guide decision-making. A procedure, on the other hand, provides step-by-step instructions for implementing those policies in daily tasks, making it clear who does what and how to achieve certain results.

What are common mistakes to avoid when writing policies and procedures?

One common mistake is using complicated language, which can confuse employees. Stick to clear, concise language to make each point easily digestible. Avoid being overly rigid; policies and procedures should have flexibility for unforeseen situations without becoming irrelevant.

What’s the best way to update policies and procedures without causing confusion?

Provide a summary of the changes right at the start, explaining why updates were made and how they affect specific roles. Announce updates to the team in several ways—such as in a meeting, via email, and through the company portal—and ask managers to go over the updates with their teams.

How can I make sure my team actually reads and understands these documents?

Break down the policy and procedure documents into short, manageable sections and use visuals like flowcharts where possible. Discuss key points in team meetings to get questions and feedback, and consider including quick-reference guides for major procedures. You might even give short quizzes to confirm employees have read each section.
