How to send or request an NDA
- **Only team members with signature authority can execute agreements on behalf of GitLab, including Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).** 
- The NDA in the standard processes below is pre-signed. For NDAs that require negotiation or third-party templates, follow the [non-standard process](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/nda/#non-standard-nda-requests).
## How To Send an NDA via DocuSign
Team members with DocuSign access can use the pre-signed GitLab NDA template to send an NDA for signature (note: all Sales team members have DocuSign access). A demo of the process can be found [here](https://youtu.be/DaOggzBcb0).
1. Log into DocuSign and select `Use a Template` from the dropdown menu under `Start`.
1. On the left, select `Shared with Me` and locate the `Non-Disclosure Agreement Pre-Signed Template`.
1. Click the template and `Add Selected`.
1. Under `Recipient`, enter the signer’s name and email address.
1. Under `GitLab Team Member`, add anyone else who needs to be cc’d on the signed copy, or click the trash icon to delete this row if not needed.
1. Do **not** delete or make any changes to the `GitLab NDA Tracker` fields (this is for the LACA team to track copies of NDAs).
1. Click Send.
**Please note:** You will be notified by email when the recipient has signed the requested NDA.
- **Sales team members:** Upload the fully executed copy of the NDA to Salesforce in the customer account.
- **Procurement team members:** Upload the fully executed NDA to the applicable folder in ContractWorks.
