## FAQ

**What if I miss one of the live sessions?**

Sessions will be recorded and available to participants. 45 days after the last live session 2022-01-11, access to session recordings will be removed.

**What if I already have an Individual Growth Plan (IGP)?**

Excellent! Bring your IGP with you to any and all live sessions. One of our goals is that this process helps you activate your IGP, so you're already one step ahead!

**How will this be different than other career development opportunities at GitLab?**

GitLab offers multiple career development resources. The goal of this program specifically is to provide a framework and accountability network around your career development.

**The live sessions are outside my working hours. Can I still participate?**

Yes! All 3 live sessions will be recorded. Cohorts will be organized across timezones, so the accountability and book reading discussions will happen in your working hours. We understand the value in attending training sessions live and hope that results from this program will allow us to expand in future quarters to provide additional live sessions.
