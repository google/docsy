## GTM Motions {#gtm-motions}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

Based on discussions with Sales and Marketing leadership, feedback from Product & Product Management leadership and by consulting industry/analyst reports, we recommend that for FY22, our major GTM motions should be focused on **CI/CD**, **DevOps Platform**, and **GitOps**. The overall goal of our GTM motions and sales play initiative is to improve the predictability of attaining our FY22 New and Growth AR goals, and improve our GTM efficiency (e.g. CAC, Cost per SAO/CW). We will do this by concentrating our efforts on the most important GTM motions that align to customer's main business goals/needs. where GitLab has a distinct competitive advantage and with accounts that have the highest LAM growth potential.

To view the GTM Motions Googlesheet, please go to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive) and search for `GTM Motions FY22 Marketing Plan`.

The GTM Motions each include a [Core Team](/handbook/marketing/plan-fy22/#core-teams), comprised of functional DRIs for subject-matter specific teams within marketing. If your specific group is not listed as a Core Team, don't worry! Each team and each individual in Marketing plays an integral role in making the FY22 Marketing Plan a reality and a success. Please see more information in [GTM Motion Core Teams](/handbook/marketing/plan-fy22/#core-teams) and [Beyond the GTM Motion Core Teams](/handbook/marketing/plan-fy22/#beyond-core-teams) below.
All marketing team members should aim to focus ~70% of their time and plans around these GTM motions, allowing for ~30% of their time to be spent testing new messaging that's not a GTM motion.

### Beyond the GTM Motion Core Teams {#beyond-core-teams}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

**All teams play an _INTEGRAL_ role in reaching our marketing goals, regardless if they are on the Core Team or not.** Differences in team alignment (i.e. to segment/region) and approaches that will span and leverage all GTM Motions, are two reasons for teams being beyond the Core Teams.

If your team or name is not listed as part of the core team, don't worry! As part of this FY22 Marketing Plan, a keen focus is alignment and ensuring everyone across marketing is connected and collaborating. **If you would like to participate on a Core Team, you may do so - connect with the Core Team of interest to learn more about getting involved!** Anyone joining a Core Team will be expected to be an active contributor and participant.

### Core Team Communication {#core-team-communication}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

How to keep all teams in the loop will be a key responsibility of the Core Teams, and planning should not happen in silos. Continual communication of plans, progress, and how to leverage the GTM Motion collateral will be a key to success in the FY22 Marketing Plan.

The teams are encouraged to contribute ideas and processes for communication here in the handbook throughout FY22.

### Interlocked Teams {#interlocked-teams}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

Interlocking the teams across marketing will help foster the most collaborative and effective results. This section outlines specific processes and concepts for the activities we drive in Marketing.

The plans should be made in a collaborative manner to address in advance potential bandwidth contraints and discuss commitment from teams.

### Corporate Marketing {#interlock-corporate-marketing}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

In advance of a quarter, the Corporate Team will outline for the GTM Motions an update on upcoming events, their anticipated audience, and elements of the event. This will help the GTM teams to understand opportunities available to test messaging, promote demos and content, etc.

_These corporate events are high investment, and also high return, and this will show in the results of the GTM Team._

Upon communication of the events, a GTM Team will commit to the event and be responsible for supporting all requested issues.

A core need from the GTM Team is to develop IN ADVANCE a **cohesive** experience from the first email invitation or ad, to the final email follow up and SDR outreach.

These events are a great opportunity to test new messaging, discuss new product features and functionality, and share feedback across the teams to implement to overall marketing strategy and messaging as relevant. In some cases, we will have messaging that worked well in the past that we want to leverage again, and review and revise as needed.

<!-- Need more background here -->

## Themes {#themes}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

Themes will help us build a more cohesive story-telling approach, leveraging the GTM Motions and unifying our activities and messaging. Pulling together collective brainpower across the marketing teams and highlighting opportunities to leverage each team's plans and ideas will help to define our FY22 themes.

Themes are expected to be generated through the Core Team planning in kicking off the GTM Motions (all teams are welcome and encouraged to contribute to theme generation!)

_For example, if we want to celebrate our alliance partners in a specific month, we can identify that as a theme and determine how all teams can contribute to the plan and deliver a cohesive and organized approach._

## Project Compass {#project-compass}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

The Marketing Team OKRs should align to the intitiatives in Project Compass.

To view the Project Compass Googlesheet, please go to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive) and search for `Project Compass: Implementation - Sales & Marketing Levers`.

**Marketing Focus in Project Compass:**

## SSoT All-Marketing Calendar {#marketing-calendar}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

In kicking off FY22, let's work together to create a single all-marketing calendar where everyone can contribute, and we can answer key questions (using filters) related to upcoming marketing plans. The calendar also lives at the top of the [Marketing Handbook Page](/handbook/marketing/#marketing-calendar).

### Mockup of All-Marketing Calendar {#marketing-calendar-mockup}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

In the future, the goal is to visualize these inputs in a calendar format with filters (based on columns in the doc) to allow the team to see the plans in Sisense. [View the Basic Mockup in FigJam!](https://www.figma.com/file/wxKZNk0ysJF77hTak9lNBn/Calendar-Mockup_2023-09-14_18-32-00?type=whiteboard&t=S9GSk8jFu3bJ28Iq-1)

Currently, the GoogleDoc has pre-set filter views to help you see plans by Region, Segment, etc. to be added by team members for their respective activities.

[Link to FigJam >](https://www.figma.com/file/wxKZNk0ysJF77hTak9lNBn/Calendar-Mockup_2023-09-14_18-32-00?type=whiteboard&t=S9GSk8jFu3bJ28Iq-1)

### Inputs to All-Marketing Calendar {#marketing-calendar-inputs}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

**Location for inputs: In your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/my-drive), search for (and bookmark) `FY22 All-Marketing Calendar SSoT`.**

This is where all teams will input and categorize planned activities, content production, themes, and more - with filters that align to key pieces of information (GTM Motions, Alliance Partners, Sales Segments, Regions, Funnel Stage, Language, and more). This will be iterative and everyone should feel open to share their feedback and ideas - [comment in the issue to sare your thoughts!](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/734)

## Team-specific commentary on the GTM Motions {#team-commentary}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

Team leaders and team members should feel empowered to add to this section, providing examples and thoughts for colleagues. Use the code below to start your section and designate a clean anchor for the section.

```markdown
### Team Name {#commentary-team-name}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->
```

### Field Marketing {#commentary-field-marketing}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

As a Field Marketer, you will be leveraging the GTM Motions in your regional strategy and plans*. You may determine that a certain GTM Motion will be more heavily leveraged in your region and/or help you reach your regional goals, and you are interested in joining the Core Team for that GTM Motion. Or perhaps you have a particular passion for a specific GTM Motion and want to be an active participant and contributor to the Core Team or a specific Sales Play. Great! Connect with the Core Team to get involved.

*You do not have to use all GTM Motions and you may go outside of these GTM Motions, although, as mentioned in the GTM Motions section, ~70% of your time should be spent focusing on the GTM Motions.

While the majority of Field Marketing activities should be focused on middle of the funnel activies (i.e. grabbing the leads from our [focus account list](/handbook/marketing/account-based-marketing/) (4300/4000) that are already in our system & pulling them through to SAO), there may be times where there is a gap in the focus account MQLs and Field Marketing will need to run a top of funnel campaign with the main goal being SAOs that support the Field Marketing FY22 goals. When Field Marketers run top of the funnel campaigns, they need to be sure to collaborate with the campaign manager aligned to their segment. This should be done to ensure there is alignment and that there is no overlap in team plans. This can be done in the bi-weekly FMM/MCM meetings that take place. There is not a formal approval process that the Field Marketer needs to go through with the campaigns team. There is much power in the teams working together and we already seeing the success of this happening!

### Campaigns Team {#commentary-campaigns-team}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

As a Campaign Manager, you have a challenge on your plate: to plan and report from the perspective of GMT Motions, AND to plan/report from the perspective of your segment/region to ensure lead flow aligned to sales targets is on track. You will be an active contributor to a Core Team by sharing insight into existing data from the GTM Motions to-date; organizing and communicating existing buyer journeys, content, and nurture emails; and strategizing/communicating top funnel activities for FY22.

You will be expected to become a subject matter expert of the GTM Motion as a Core Team member and ensure the Demand Generation team is up-to-date with what is planned for the GTM Motion (so that team members can best leverage the GTM Motions within their top-funnel campaign plans by segment/region.

## Project Management {#project-management}

<!-- DO NOT CHANGE ANCHOR -->

The GTM Motions will each have an epic, where all teams can reference plans and the issues (i.e. action items) to accomplish the plans. We will be making use of 2 week milestones (Marketing - 2021-MM-DD) as well as GTM Motion labels for each team. The teams themselves will decide how often to have stand-ups, whether live or through slack, as well as any other synchronous calls.

- The "Scrum of Scrums" kanban issue board is based on the GTM Motion labels and can be found at the gitlab.com level under GTM Motions FY22
