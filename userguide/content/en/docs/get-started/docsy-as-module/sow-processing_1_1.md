## SOW Creation

:warning: This page is under construction

We use the SOW generator that is part of the [Services Calculator project](https://gitlab.com/services-calculator/services-calculator.gitlab.io) to create SOWs.  See that project's [README](https://gitlab.com/services-calculator/services-calculator.gitlab.io/-/blob/master/README.md) for additional information on how to generate an SOW.
