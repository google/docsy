## Introduction

On this page, we explain how we review our Compensation Calculator in preparation for the Compensation Review Cycle.

## Reviews Conducted for Annual Compensation Review

### Benchmarking Review

Benchmarking review is an internal process completed by the Compensation team to determine any adjustments to role benchmarks.

#### Process

1. All roles are reviewed using market data from Radford and Comptryx. 
1. The benchmark is increased based on the output of market data and internal alignment to peer roles. 
1. Once the new benchmarks are reviewed and approved, these are updated in the [compensation calculator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/peopleops-eng/compensation-calculator/-/blob/main/data/job_families.yml).

### Location Factor Review

The location factor review is an internal process completed by the Compensation team to determinate any adjustments to location factors for the next FY which is completed in November.

#### Process

1. All localities where we have team members and/or are actively recruited are reviewed using data from Radford, Comptryx, and ERI. 
1. Location factors are increased only if there is an increase as compared to SF of at least 5%. 
1. Once the new locations factors are reviewed and approved, these are updated in the [compensation calculator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/peopleops-eng/compensation-calculator/-/blob/main/data/location_factors.yml).

*Note*: Please note that a change in location factor or benchmark does not imply a change in compensation. Team members will be reviewed for a [market adjustment](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/#market-adjustments) if they are below the minimum of the range.
