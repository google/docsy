## Purpose

This page provides an overview of CSM team OKRs and the OKR process. The CSM teams use OKRs to empower the team and unlock the power of the [scenius](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scenius).

OKRs should provide continuous strategic alignment with the business. Our Big Rocks are our annual OKRs and our quarterly OKRs contribute to them.

## Terminology

- **Objective:** The Mission
- **Key Results:** Measures of movement and behaviour
- **Initiatives:** Activities that we theorise will move the key results in a direction that brings us closer to achieving the Objective.

## Principles

OKRs Should be Inclusive (Segments, regions etc) and lean in to heavily into our [bias towards asynchronous contributions](/handbook/values/#bias-towards-asynchronous-communication).

### Objectives

- Outcome over output
- Inspirational and aspirational
- Avoid overlapping objectives
- Business aligned

### Key Results

- Measurable
- Standard format: `<Verb> <measure> from <x> to <y>`
- Leading and lagging measures
- No more than 3 to 5 Key Results per OKR
