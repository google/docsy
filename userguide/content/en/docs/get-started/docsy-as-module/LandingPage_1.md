## Types of automated climate action ‚úä

### üìâ Carbon avoidance projects

The high-quality carbon avoidance projects we support cover a variety of project types, including rainforest protection, and community-based initiatives such as providing access to clean water and fuel-efficient cookstoves.

Each and every tonne is certified by industry-leading standards, such as the [Gold Standard](https://ecologi.com/articles/blog/what-is-the-gold-standard-carbon-offset) or [Verified Carbon Standard](https://ecologi.com/articles/blog/what-is-the-verified-carbon-standard), and we monitor our impact across all the projects we have funded. When choosing projects, we‚Äôre guided by our science-based [Impact Regionalisation Strategy](https://ecologi-assets.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/files/Ecologi-Impact-Strategy.pdf), which ensures we‚Äôre supporting project types in countries that will have the most impact.

### üå± Tree-planting

We fund the planting of trees all over the world through our [trusted reforestation partners](https://ecologi.com/articles/blog/get-to-know-our-reforestation-partners). Working in conjunction with organisations that plant a diverse mix of ecologically-appropriate species, these projects enhance local biodiversity and help to support local communities through direct employment, gender empowerment, education and stewardship opportunities. We support planting sites in around 15 countries, which means that your funding is divided between our active projects across the world.
