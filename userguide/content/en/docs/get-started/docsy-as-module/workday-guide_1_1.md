title: Workday Guide
---

## Why Workday?

- Integrated people processes that allow us to view Team Member data in one system (compensation, performance, benefits, absence management, etc.)
- Our data will be more accessible, timely, accurate, and consistent. This will allow us to improve our reporting and analytics capabilities
- Provides us with the ability to make informed organizational decisions and increase operational efficiencies based on that data
- Enhanced and standardized processes and workflows
- Increased visibility and transparency of Team Member data changes and status of those transactions
- 24/7 access from anywhere using the mobile application
- Supports streamlined access and self-service for all team members

## Accessing Workday

Workday will be accessible to all GitLab team members through Okta SSO. Go to [gitlab.okta.com](https://gitlab.okta.com/app/UserHome) and click on the **‘Workday SSO’** tile to login. You can search your apps for quick access.

**Important:** Please note that Workday will be temporarily unavailable due to scheduled weekly maintenance each Friday between 11:00 PM - 3:00 AM PST (Saturday between 6am UTC to 9am UTC).

## Workday Guides

Every full time team member at GitLab will have a Workday profile, though the extent of each team member's engagement with Workday will vary according to their position.

Use these helpful resources for completing team member self-service tasks in Workday. These resources currently live in Google Drive but will be moved to the handbook in upcoming iterations.
