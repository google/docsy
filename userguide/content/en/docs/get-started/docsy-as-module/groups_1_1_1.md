## What are Zendesk groups?

As per [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408886146842-About-organizations-and-groups#topic_iny_3jg_sz):

> Groups collect team members together based on criteria those team members have in common. Groups can only contain team members; no end users can be included. All agents must be assigned to at least one group, but they can be members of more than one. Groups can be used to support organizations. You can designate one group as the default group for your account and you can also designate a default group for each team member. All new team members you create will be added to the default group.
