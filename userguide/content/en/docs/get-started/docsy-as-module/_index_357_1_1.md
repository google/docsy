## Member Involvement

This section is meant to outline how team members in the Black@GitLab TMRG can contribute to key initiatives each quarter. We encourage team members to contribute in any way they feel comfortable and have capacity - from meeting attendance to leading initiatives and anywhere in between!

### Monthly Black@GitLab TMRG Meeting

Every month, one meeting of 45 minutes will be hosted at a time to accommodate in turn US WEST/EAST, EMEA and APAC team members. Allies are always encouraged to attend any TMRG meeting. The call structure includes:

- 25 minutes for full group discussion of agenda topics
- 20 minutes social discussion (NOT RECORDED)

This meeting can be replaced by an edition special one with different structure to cover dedicated topics.

### Quartely CRO Reverse AMA

This meeting is hosted 1x per month as follows

- every 2 months (odd) on the first Thursday at 01:00pm UTC and 01:45pm UTC.
- every 2 months (even) on the second Monday at 04:30pm UTC and 05:15pm UTC.

The purpose is to provide an opportunity to increase and leverage communication between our Sales Leadership and Sales team members who identify as people of color

Understanding and acknowledging that our team members of color are experiencing a lot of emotions right now, and are processing those emotions in different ways. Our [Values](/handbook/values/) promote being inclusive, [Building a Safe Community](/handbook/values/#building-a-safe-community), and [Being an Ally](/handbook/communication/ally-resources/), and we need to lean into these focus areas, starting with our own team.

### Contribute to a TMRG key initiative

We use our [GitLab issue board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/black-tmrg/-/boards) to coordinate and prioritize projects on a quarterly basis. Contribute to the issue board by:

1. Open a new issue to propose an idea or project
1. Contribute to an open issue that is assigned to a quarterly milestone. These milestones outline the current focus projects of the TMRG
