## Program update tracker

Customer email programs are updated when new content is added, existing content changes or existing content needs to be removed.

The [program update tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NyxIjucb8vQ-1Lch2vgzb801NNGLn7cd2iq8LuTtFlQ/edit?usp=sharing) allows us to see what the general contents of each program contain so we can quickly determine which programs need to be updated.
