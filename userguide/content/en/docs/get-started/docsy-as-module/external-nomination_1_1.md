## External Customer reference process at GitLab

We have an [external landing page](https://page.gitlab.com/reference.html) that is integrated into customer communications to promote customers to register their interest in joining our Reference Program.

Process for managing these responses is outlined [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iK34NOTLi_Nyq3wyOZQwhPj_D7gU7zRyr2GCCmWMksM/edit#slide=id.gd5ed1e508c_0_0)
