> Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes

## Objectives

In this lab, you will install GitLab and its necessary dependencies on a virtual machine using the command line.
Before you get started, complete the following:

- Open the [GitLab Linux Installation](https://about.gitlab.com/install/#almalinux-8) page in a separate browser tab for reference.
- Open the lab setup instructions provided by the instructor to locate your assigned public IPv4 address for your Omnibus server. You will use SSH to access the training environment.

### Task A. Access training environment

> Your training environment consists of two EC2 instances in AWS. You will use the first instance to deploy GitLab and the second instance to deploy a runner for your GitLab instance. For this section of the lab, use the instance designated for the GitLab installation.

1. On your local computer, open a terminal window.

1. Navigate to the directory that contains the SSH key file for your server.

1. SSH connections require that your private key file is not accessible by others. On Linux and MacOS, you can do this with the following command:

    ```bash
    chmod 400 <keyfile_name>
    ```

    On Windows, you can do this with the following command:

    ```bash
    icacls .\keyname.pem /inheritance:r
    ```

1. Use your assigned IP address and SSH key file to log in to the server that will host your GitLab Omnibus install:

    ```bash
    ssh -i <keyfile_name> ec2-user@<vm_ip_address>
    ```

1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. If your system displays an authentication warning, type `yes` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. After typing yes, you will be connected to your server.

### Task B. Install necessary dependencies

1. Install Postfix so GitLab can send notification emails by using the command below:

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install -y curl policycoreutils perl postfix
    ```

1. Start and enable Postfix using the `systemctl enable` and the `systemctl start` commands:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable postfix
    sudo systemctl start postfix
    ```

### Task C. Install GitLab

1. Add the GitLab install repository via the `curl` command:

    ```bash
    curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
    ```

1. Install the GitLab package using the command below. Use your training system's assigned public IP address in lieu of a fully qualified domain name. Make sure not to include the <> symbols.

    ```bash
    sudo EXTERNAL_URL="http://<your_assigned_public_ip>" dnf install -y gitlab-ee
    ```

    > This step may take a few minutes to complete.
    > For this example, we added `http://` to the front of the URL. For this set of labs, we are using the `http` protocol. If you are installing GitLab in a production environment, it is recommended to use `https://` to use the `https` protocol.

### Task D. Login and reset password

1. During installation, a password is randomly generated and stored for 24 hours in `/etc/gitlab/initial_root_password`. To view the generated password, use the command below:

    ```bash
    sudo cat /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password
    ```

2. Copy the password shown in the output to your clipboard.

3. Using a web browser, navigate to `http://<your_assigned_public_IP>/`.

4. To log in, type in `root` as your username, and the password copied previously for your password.

5. Once logged in, in the upper left corner of the GitLab landing page, select your root user avatar, then **Edit Profile**.

6. In the left navigation pane, select **Password**.

7. In the **Current password** text box, enter the temporary root password used for initial login.

8. Complete the remaining fields with a new, permanent password of your choosing.

9. Click **Save password** to save the changes. You will need to re-sign in with your new password.
