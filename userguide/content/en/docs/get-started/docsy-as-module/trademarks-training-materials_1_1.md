## Trademarks at GitLab

GitLab’s brand is one of its most valuable assets. As part of this, GitLab's trademarks (the name GitLab, and the GitLab <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/logo/png/gitlab-icon-rgb.png" target="_blank">Tanuki logo</a>) distinguish GitLab’s product from those of its competitors. They also signify to our customers and prospects the high quality of our product, which people associate with GitLab.

This series of three training sessions, covering *An Introduction to Trademarks*, *Using Third-party Trademarks*, and *Using the GitLab Trademark*, serves to introduce team members to key trademarks concepts relevant to their role at GitLab.
