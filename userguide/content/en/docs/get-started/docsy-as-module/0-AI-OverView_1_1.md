### AI overview

Google's generative AI capabilities exist across multiple platforms and products, integrating tools for both end users and developers. Here are some key places where Google’s generative AI features are currently available:

1. **Google Search and Search Generative Experience (SGE)**:
   - Google has integrated generative AI into its search engine with SGE, providing more contextually rich and conversational answers to queries. Instead of just displaying links, SGE offers summaries, explanations, and interactive follow-up questions.

2. **Google Workspace (Docs, Gmail, Slides, Sheets, etc.)**:
   - Google's suite of productivity tools includes generative AI features under the brand **Duet AI**. In Docs and Gmail, for instance, users can generate drafts, summarize emails, brainstorm ideas, and more. In Sheets, it can help with data insights and automated categorization, while in Slides, it assists with generating visuals and design suggestions.

3. **Bard**:
   - Bard is Google's experimental chatbot, similar to ChatGPT, which provides conversational AI responses across a wide range of topics. It is accessible as a standalone web app and supports various integrations with Google services for personalized assistance.

4. **Vertex AI on Google Cloud**:
   - For developers and enterprises, Google offers generative AI capabilities through **Vertex AI** on Google Cloud. Vertex AI supports building, deploying, and scaling machine learning and large language models. This platform enables developers to use Google’s foundation models and offers tools for fine-tuning, embedding, and deploying models in applications.

5. **PaLM API**:
   - The **PaLM API** provides access to Google’s large language models for developers. It's part of Google Cloud and is designed for those looking to embed generative AI functionality directly into their apps, such as for chatbots, content generation, or code assistance.

6. **AI Test Kitchen**:
   - Google’s AI Test Kitchen offers interactive experiences where users can try out Google’s latest AI models and give feedback. It’s a space for experimentation with generative AI features before they are rolled out more broadly.

These integrations span consumer-facing applications to developer tools, making Google’s generative AI accessible to both everyday users and businesses.

### How do links appear in AI Overviews?
AI Overviews show links to resources that support the information in the snapshot, and explore the topic further. This allows people to dig deeper and discover a diverse range of content from publishers, creators, retailers, businesses, and more, and use the information they find to advance their tasks.

Google's systems automatically determine which links appear. There is nothing special for creators to do to be considered other than to follow our regular guidance for appearing in search, as covered in Google Search Essentials.
