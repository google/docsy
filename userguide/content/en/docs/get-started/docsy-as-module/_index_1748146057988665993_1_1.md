## Resources

### Secure coding best practices

It is important that all developers are aware of [secure coding best practices](/handbook/security/secure-coding-training/) and refresh this knowledge periodically. This is tracked via Secure Coding Training Guidelines.

### Ruby on Rails Performance Training

The materials from an earlier Ruby on Rails performance workshop can be found on [internally shared Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=in:0ACCfBKgYFjLvUk9PVA).

### Database

Here is the information of a PostgreSQL query optimization bot at GitLab - Joe: [Blueprint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/readiness/-/tree/master/library/database/postgres/query-optimization-bot/blueprint) and [Design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/readiness/-/tree/master/library/database/postgres/query-optimization-bot/design).

### Frontend

#### Frontend Masters

[Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) allows you to advance your skills with in-depth, modern frontend engineering courses.

Team members can use the Growth and Development Fund to request a subscription by following the process outlined at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/.

### GraphQL

We use GraphQL alongside our REST API at GitLab and are increasingly adding new features to the GraphQL API over time.

The GraphQL API can be added to by anyone, including [community members](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/). We have a group of self-selected team members who are willing to help with any GraphQL questions you may have. You can get in touch with them by mentioning `@gitlab-org/graphql-experts` in any GitLab issue or merge request.

You can read more information about GraphQL at GitLab here:

- [Getting started with GitLab GraphQL API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/getting_started.html)
- [GraphQL frontend guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fe_guide/graphql.html)
- [GraphQL API style guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/api_graphql_styleguide.html)
- [Introduction to GraphQL (graphql.org)](https://graphql.org/learn/)

### Engineering Management

One of the paths for engineers to progress in their career is a Management path. To explain more about the role
of Engineering Managers in GitLab, there is a series of conversations with team members explaining details of their work and their experience transitioning to management
[here](/handbook/engineering/training/em-role/).

### IC Leadership

Staff+ engineers and ICs aspiring to become Staff can benefit from resources and recommendations described
[here](/handbook/engineering/training/staff-plus-role/).

## GitLab LevelUp

[GitLab LevelUp](https://levelup.edcast.com/home) is a Learning Experience Platform (LXP) meant to provide training and professional development for team members. We will continue being [handbook first](/handbook/about/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first), and use this platform to organize, surface, and promote relevant content that exists today.
