A high performance culture starts with a healthy organizational structure and team. The Quarterly Talent Review (QTR) is a strategic mechanism designed to bring our E-Group leaders together with their respectively aligned key People Group counterparts in a single session to review key Talent metrics and strategy on a quarterly basis with the ultimate goal of driving forward a tightly aligned divisional Talent Strategy.

Goals and benefits of the QTR include the ability to:

- Connect dots and draw themes across multiple data sources that may not have been as evident reviewed in isolation
- Create more connection and alignment across all departments within the People Group as one team
- Optimize time and efficiency across the board for our E-Group leaders
- Ensure we maintain a regular and proactive pulse on key Talent metrics
- Align on and communicate a tailored and data driven division Talent Strategy going in to each fiscal year

## Quarterly Talent Review Timeline

The QTR report will be delivered to PBPs on the 15th day at the start of each quarter (dates below). This report will serve as the foundation for the discussions with division leaders.

Where applicable, CoE leaders will also have the opportunity to include a `Top of Mind` overview slide to ensure that there is an opportunity to share key strategic initiatives as part of this forum.

**2. Prep Call**

**4. Quarterly Talent Review with E-Group**

- **When:** The QTR should take place by the end of the first month of the quarter, giving adequate time for review and actions. PBPs should work with E-Group EBAs to plan these sessions in advance as a standing ongoing touchpoint.
