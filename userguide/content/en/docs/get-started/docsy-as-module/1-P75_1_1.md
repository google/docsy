### P75
The 75th percentile, often abbreviated as P75, is a statistical measure that tells you the maximum time within which 75% of users experience a specific page load time. It’s a helpful metric for evaluating web performance because it provides insight into the "typical" experience of the majority of users while allowing for a small margin for slower experiences.

Here’s how it works in detail:

### 1. **Understanding Percentiles in Context**
   - Imagine you have 1,000 users loading your webpage.
   - If you arrange all these page load times from fastest to slowest, the 75th percentile is the point where 75% of the load times fall below this value.
   - The remaining 25% of users have page load times longer than this threshold.
   - So, if the 75th percentile load time is 3 seconds, this means that 750 out of the 1,000 users experienced a load time of **3 seconds or less**.

### 2. **Why the 75th Percentile Is Used**
   - **Balance of Performance and User Satisfaction**: While aiming for perfect performance (100% of users having fast page loads) is ideal, it's often not practical due to various factors (e.g., slower networks, lower-end devices, etc.). The 75th percentile focuses on optimizing for the majority without the pressure of achieving perfection across every scenario.
   - **Identifying Common User Experience**: It’s considered a good threshold for ensuring that most users have a satisfying experience while still accounting for some variability.

### 3. **Using the 75th Percentile for Mobile vs. Desktop**
   - Mobile and desktop devices often have different hardware capabilities, network speeds, and usage patterns.
   - **Segmenting by Device Type**: Measuring the 75th percentile separately for mobile and desktop helps identify and address performance gaps specific to each device type. For example:
     - **On mobile devices**: 75th percentile may be higher because mobile users might be on slower networks or less powerful devices. So, you may set a target for mobile that’s slightly longer than desktop (e.g., 4 seconds instead of 3).
     - **On desktop devices**: Since users typically have faster internet and more processing power, the 75th percentile threshold may be lower (e.g., aiming for 2-3 seconds).

### 4. **Why Not Use the Average or Median?**
   - The **average** (mean) can be skewed by outliers — a few extremely slow load times (e.g., users with very poor connectivity) can raise the average significantly.
   - The **median** (50th percentile) tells you what the "typical" user experiences, but it doesn’t reveal much about a broader user experience spectrum.
   - The **75th percentile** is a good balance, as it focuses on the performance that most users will experience, while still identifying potential issues affecting slower users without being skewed by extreme outliers.

### 5. **Real-World Application**
   - Let’s say, after measuring page load times, you find the following:
     - **Desktop 75th Percentile**: 2.5 seconds (meaning 75% of desktop users experience page load times of 2.5 seconds or less).
     - **Mobile 75th Percentile**: 4 seconds (75% of mobile users experience page load times of 4 seconds or less).
   - If your target is under 3 seconds for all users, you may focus on optimizing the mobile experience since it exceeds your threshold, perhaps by improving mobile image loading, reducing scripts, or enhancing caching strategies.

Using the 75th percentile as a benchmark allows you to optimize your website to meet the expectations of a majority of users while balancing feasibility and resource investment. It’s a practical way to aim for better user satisfaction without the often-unrealistic goal of optimizing for every user, especially those with extreme conditions.

### measuring P75

To measure the 75th percentile of page load times, you can use a combination of **analytics tools, performance monitoring services,** and **custom calculations**. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Use Performance Analytics Tools**
   Many performance monitoring tools automatically calculate percentile-based metrics. Here are a few popular tools that can help:

   - **Google Analytics**: If your site is set up with Google Analytics, you can track page load times under *Behavior > Site Speed > Page Timings*. While Google Analytics doesn't directly give you percentiles, you can export the data and calculate the 75th percentile manually.
   - **Google Lighthouse** (or **PageSpeed Insights**): Both tools offer performance metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) with percentile scores, and you can see metrics segmented by mobile and desktop.
   - **WebPageTest**: This tool provides in-depth performance metrics for individual pages, often segmented by various percentile markers, including the 75th percentile.
   - **Real User Monitoring (RUM) tools**: Tools like New Relic, Datadog, Dynatrace, or SpeedCurve provide real-user data across many devices and networks. These tools can automatically calculate and display the 75th percentile of various metrics, segmented by device type (mobile or desktop).

### 2. **Gather and Segment Data**
   If you’re gathering raw data from logs or using a tool that doesn’t directly calculate percentiles, you can follow these steps:
   
   - **Log individual page load times** for each user session. Many platforms let you export data, or you can set up custom event tracking (e.g., with Google Tag Manager).
   - **Segment data by device type** (e.g., mobile vs. desktop). You can either set this up as a report or filter if using a tool, or categorize it manually if exporting raw data.
   
### 3. **Calculate the 75th Percentile Manually**
   If you have raw data for page load times, you can calculate the 75th percentile manually. Here’s how to do it:

   1. **Sort the data**: Arrange the page load times from fastest to slowest.
   2. **Find the 75th percentile index**: Multiply the total number of observations by 0.75. For example, if you have 1,000 load time measurements, 1,000 x 0.75 = 750.
   3. **Locate the 75th percentile value**: Go to the position of the value that corresponds to your calculated index. In this case, the 750th value in the sorted list represents the 75th percentile of load times. If you have a fractional index, you can interpolate between values.

### 4. **Using SQL or Spreadsheet Software**
   If you’re working with data in a database or a spreadsheet, you can use built-in functions to quickly find the 75th percentile.

   - **In SQL**: Many SQL databases have a `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75)` function, which calculates the 75th percentile. For example:
     ```sql
     SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY page_load_time) AS p75_load_time
     FROM page_load_data
     WHERE device_type = 'mobile';
     ```
   - **In Excel or Google Sheets**: Use the `PERCENTILE` function. For example:
     ```excel
     =PERCENTILE(A2:A1000, 0.75)
     ```
     This will calculate the 75th percentile for data in cells A2 through A1000.

### 5. **Interpret and Act on the Results**
   Once you have your 75th percentile page load time for both mobile and desktop devices, you can set performance goals and monitor progress over time. If your 75th percentile load time is above your target, consider optimizations like reducing asset sizes, implementing lazy loading, or optimizing server response times to bring it down. Regularly re-measuring will help ensure that improvements positively impact the majority of users.
