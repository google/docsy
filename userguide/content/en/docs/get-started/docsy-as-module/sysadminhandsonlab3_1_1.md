> Estimated time to complete: 40 minutes

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to demonstrate how to create and register a GitLab Runner on a server. For more information about GitLab Runners, click [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/).

### Task A. Install the gitlab-runner package

1. Use your assigned IP address and SSH key file to log into your **GitLab Runner** server (*not* your Omnibus server).

    ```bash
    ssh -i <YOUR_ASSIGNED_SSH_KEYFILE> ec2-user@<YOUR_RUNNER_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>
    ```

1. If your system displays an authentication warning, type `yes` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

1. Add the GitLab Runner installation repository.

    ```bash
    curl -L "https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/runner/gitlab-runner/script.rpm.sh" | sudo bash
    ```

1. Install the GitLab Runner agent.

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install -y gitlab-runner
  ```

1. Once the install completes, check that the service is running.

  ```bash
  sudo gitlab-runner status
  ```

### Task B. Register a runner with GitLab

1. Sign into your GitLab instance with a web browser and select **Menu > Admin Area**.

1. In the left sidebar, under **CI/CD**, select **Runners**.

1. Select **New instance runner**.

1. In the **Tags** section, select **Run untagged jobs**.

    > This will allow the runner to pick up any jobs rather than just jobs with specific tags.

1. Leave all other options as default and select **Create runner**.

1. Copy the command in **Step 1**, and add `sudo` in front of the command. Run it in your command prompt.

1. The command will first prompt you for your GitLab instance URL. Verify that this URL matches your GitLab instance, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

1. Enter any appropriate name for your runner.

1. When you are prompted for an executor, type `shell`.

    > A shell executor will run jobs using your instance's shell. For more information about executors, check the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/).

1. Run `sudo gitlab-runner list` to verify the runner after registration.

1. Return to your web browser and select **Go to runners page**. Verify the runner you registered appears in the list and shows as online.

### Task C. Test the runner with a CI/CD pipeline

1. Navigate back to the homepage of your GitLab instance by selecting the GitLab icon at the top of the left sidebar.

1. Select **Create a project**.

1. Select **Create blank project**.

1. Enter `CICD Test` as the project name.

1. In the `Project URL`, select `root` from the namespace dropdown.

1. Leave all other settings as they are and click **Create project**.

1. In the middle of the project landing page, under the project title, select the **+** dropdown. Select **New file**.

1. On the new file page, enter `.gitlab-ci.yml` as the file name.

1. Paste the following code into the body of the file.

  ```yml
  stages:
    - build
    - test

  build_app:
    stage: build
    script:
      - echo "The build stage requires at least one job"

  test_app:
    stage: test
    script:
      - echo "The test stage requires at least one job"
  ```

1. Select **Commit changes**.

1. In the left sidebar, select **Build > Pipelines**.

1. Select the pipeline status (it should say **passed**).

1. Click into each of the **build_app** and **test_app** jobs to see the job logs and commands that were executed on the runner.
