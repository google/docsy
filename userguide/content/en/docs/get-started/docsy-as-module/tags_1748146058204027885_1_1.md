## What are Zendesk tags?

As per [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408888664474-About-tags):

> Tags are words, or combinations of words, you can use to add more context to tickets and topics. You can apply tags to tickets, users, and organizations.

At its core, Zendesk relies on tags pretty heavily. As such, it is best to fully understand the tags used and how they correlate to what Zendesk does to the ticket.

## What are our tags?

As there are many, many tags, and new ones get added frequently, we maintain it via the [Zendesk Tags](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VUaXLcE3L--uBhKi2VrNk8wzaslkydF5AMTMsJMiQpU/edit?usp=sharing) Google sheet (internal access only).
