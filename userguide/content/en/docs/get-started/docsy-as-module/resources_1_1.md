### Co-working, communal workspaces, and third spaces

Remote work [enables]({{< ref "./phases-of-remote-adaptation" >}}) individuals and teams to create and contribute in places other than a home or conventional office. Many are familiar with [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/) and [Regus](https://www.regus.com/en-us), where a desk or office is available to rent. Post-COVID, leaders are recognizing the need to support the *third space* — a workplace that isn't one's home, and isn't an office.

Some organizations (like GitLab) provide stipends or [reimbursement](/handbook/finance/expenses/#coworking-or-external-office--space) as a matter of inclusivity and productivity. Not every home is amenable to remote work, and not everyone is comfortable working in a traditional office. These communal workspaces provide the energy and camaraderie of working in-person as a group, with the flexibility of being near one's home (and in turn, avoiding a commute).

- [Codi](https://www.codi.com/) (residential coworking spaces in neighborhoods that matter to you)
- [Switchyards](https://switchyards.com/) (neighborhood work clubs)
- [WorkChew](https://workchew.com/) (alternative workspaces within restaurants and hotels)
