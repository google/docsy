## Bug Hunting Day Process

The Application Security Team has a bug hunting day on the last Friday of every month.

### Goal

The objective is to have some time to investigate on something a team member has observed, discussed or noticed during a review but didn't have the time to go into a detailed review or testing.

Bug hunting day is not mandatory. There may be months that are particularly busy and we may not be doing bug hunting days on months like that.

### How to get started?

1. Open an issue with the `bug-hunting-day` template, or click [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/appsec/appsec-team/-/issues/new?issuable_template=bug-hunting-day) to create a new one (template already selected).
1. Check the previous issues for some outstanding ideas
1. Put your ideas on the issue or ask the team for topics if you don't have anything in mind
1. Join the zoom meeting time to time during the day to exchange with other team members.
