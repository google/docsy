### Token Limits

> [!note]
> This section covers tips for token limits in [context windows](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows), for API rate limits please review [Anthropics rate limit documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits#rate-limits).

To help prevent hitting rate limits while using Claude, we recommend following the tips below:

- Set the appropriate thinking mode, Extended seems to support more context that you upload and generated content.
- Set the response mode to Concise to shorten Claudes response length.
- Before re-prompting, try editing your previous prompt to include your new ask.
- Be specific in your prompt, 3.7 likes to try and build out more than you ask, clarify to only make the changes requested in a more iterative approach.

> [!note]
> At the time of this writing, _Claude 3.5 Sonnet_, has higher rate limits, so if this does the job and you need long conversations, this may be a viable choice until rate limits on _Claude 3.7 Sonnet_ are increased, although will be missing out on improvements made in the 3.7 version of the model.
