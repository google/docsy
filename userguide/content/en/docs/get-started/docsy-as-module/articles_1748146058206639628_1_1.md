We use Zendesk Guide for Knowledge base. The Knowledge base has 3 type of roles with different permissions:

Support Engineer, Knowledge Champions and Knowledge Admins.

- **Support Editors**: Create, update and use KB articles in tickets.
- **Support Publishers**: Review, publish, archive and control permissions.
- **Admins**: Make sure everything runs smoothly.
