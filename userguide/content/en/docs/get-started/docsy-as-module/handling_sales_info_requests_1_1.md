### Overview

Use this workflow when there's a query about new GitLab offerings from an existing
customer. It can also be used to handle situations where customers express their
need via a support ticket to get in contact with their account manager.

### Workflow

1. Check the organization's information in Zendesk to find the CSM for the customer.
   > **Note:** In Zendesk, click on the organization name under the tab at the top,
   then scroll down and look for the `Account Owner` or `Customer Success Manager` fields.
1. Respond to the ticket, CC-ing the CSM letting them know of the
customer's interest in new/more GitLab offerings.
