## NEW ⚡️ GitLab Field Flash: June 2021 Edition ⚡️

In this month's [Field Flash](/handbook/sales/field-communications/field-flash-newsletter/#overview), you'll find more details on the GitOps Infrastructure Automation Sales Play, the President’s Club 2022 dashboard, the latest quarterly Microsoft Compete Report, a new resource to help you position the value of Ultimate and much more. Plus, bid farewell to Haydn Mackay in his Team Member Spotlight.

### NEW Sales Play: Infrastructure Automation with GitOps

The newest Sales Play is here: [Infrastructure Automation with GitOps](/handbook/marketing/sales-plays/gitops/)! Check out the details below and start using this play to help close more business.

**What:** This Sales Play will help you identify customers interested in GitOps and have the GitOps conversation with confidence. In it, you’ll find:

1. Insights on buyer personas, common pain points and required capabilities
1. Guidance on positioning value, including an elevator pitch, value prop, differentiators, competitive intel and objection handling
1. [Sales Play Tactics](/handbook/marketing/sales-plays/gitops/#sales-tactics) that provide step-by-step actions for ENT, MM and SMB reps to put the play into practice to generate leads and meaningful customer conversations

**Who:** This Sales Play focuses on expanding DevOps best practices to Infrastructure teams.

**Why:** GitOps is HOT right now! More than 45% of our [survey respondents at Kubecon EU](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/issues/4792) highlighted that GitOps is a priority for their organization in the short term. Our GitOps marketing campaigns have been the best performing since launching in April 2020. Need more reasons? [Look here](/handbook/marketing/sales-plays/gitops/#why-should-you-care-about-gitops).

### What's New in GitLab 🚀

The GitLab 13.12 release is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:

- **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk:** On-Demand DAST scanning is now generally available for all GitLab Ultimate customers to help them ensure their production environment is always secure. In addition, GitLab Ultimate customers are invited to a public beta for a new browser-based crawler for DAST, which is expected to provide significantly better security testing coverage for modern applications compared to GitLab’s current proxy-based crawler. Lastly, the Project Vulnerability Report now gives customers the ability to filter by scanner and vendor, allowing them to more easily benefit from a unified scanner view in GitLab.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** GitLab has made pipelines easier to use for both new and experienced users with features like a collapsible panel of guided instructions that will help new CI/CD users create their first pipeline, the ability to break .gitlab-ci.yml files into multiple smaller files to improve reusability and readability, the ability to define variables within rules and a new view in the pipeline graph that shows dependencies between jobs.
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** 13.12 embraces insights that improve customers’ DevOps maturity, including the introduction of a group-level deployment frequency chart, which will help customers understand the efficiency of their deployments over time, find bottlenecks, and focus on improvement areas that span across projects and teams. It also includes improvements to value stream analytics to help identify the root cause of inefficiencies in workflows.

### Team Member Spotlight 🔦

#### Haydn Mackay - Regional Director, AMER West

![Haydn-Mackay-TMS-Thumb](/handbook/sales/field-communications/field-flash-newsletter/images/Haydn-Mackay-TMS-Thumb.png)

**Where did you grow up, and where are you based now?**

I was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia but moved to a small country town about 3 hours north of Melbourne called Milawa when I was 5 years old. After 17 years in the San Francisco Bay Area, I moved to Incline Village, Nevada on the east shore of Lake Tahoe right before COVID broke out.

**What was your favorite thing about your job?**

It’s always been about the people and building new relationships (both internal and external) to achieve a goal. Helping someone be successful has always provided me the most satisfaction.

**Which of GitLab's Values resonates most with you?**

When I first found GitLab in 2014, the value of Transparency really stood out. As an open source project, being open and transparent with your community is really important, and I suspect that’s why GitLab was able to build a strong community very quickly.

**Do you have a helpful tip for working at GitLab and/or in the Field org to share?**

In 2018, William Chia (Manager, Product Marketing), was kind enough to introduce me to Twilio’s current CRO, Marc Boroditsky, for a coffee chat. Marc used the term ‘relentless prioritization’ and that stuck with me. With GitLab being so open where everyone can contribute, it’s easy to lose focus on your OKRs. So, I encourage you to write that on a post-it note and stick it on your monitor.

In terms of day-to-day work, my advice is to bookmark the [Field Flash archives page](/handbook/sales/field-communications/field-flash-newsletter/#past-newsletters) as there’s so much useful and consolidated content that can help you.

**What is a hobby or skill you have that the team might not know about?**

I can touch the tip of my nose with my tongue.

**We will miss you! Are there any parting words you’d like to share with the team?**

Be kind to each other. With all that’s happening in the world right now and the pressure of working at a fast-growing company, kindness isn’t always easy. You have to be deliberate about it. I recorded a short farewell video for the team reflecting on my 7+ years at GitLab. [You can watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5bU1KFmZes).
