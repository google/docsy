### What's New in GitLab üöÄ

The GitLab 13.0 milestone release is live! [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dStIhTP1ckg&feature=youtu.be) from Scott Williamson highlighting what themes you can expect to see in 13.0 releases. Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:

- **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk:** Companies can take advantage of our improved Application Security Testing capabilities to help find and fix security vulnerabilities earlier. (On a related note, we were just named a Niche Player in the 2020 [Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing](https://page.gitlab.com/resources-report-gartner-magic-quadrant-ast.html).) And, they can better manage vulnerabilities with improvements to the way we handle vulnerability objects end-to-end in GitLab.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** GitLab 13.0 focuses on features that help businesses streamline existing software development processes in order to be more responsive and efficient. This includes things like simplified deployment to Amazon ECS and a new consolidated list of alerts that provides a single interface to aggregate IT alerts originating from multiple sources.
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** Organizations can now view epic hierarchies on their roadmaps, visualize how epics line up with various milestones, and more in order to manage complex projects and rapidly collaborate and respond across the entire team. They can also rest easier knowing that critical Git repositories are safe with our enhanced Gitaly cluster for high availability Git storage.
