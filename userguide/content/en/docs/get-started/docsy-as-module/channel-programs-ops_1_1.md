title: "Channel Programs Operations"
---








### Overview

This page documents the operational information and processes for managing the Channel Program Operations.  This page does not include transactional processes, which are available on the [Channel Operations Handbook page](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/).

## Partner Contracts

Partners register to join the GitLab Partner Program by registering at partners.gitlab.com.  You can find more details about the registration process on the [Channel Operations Handbook](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-applicant-approval--denial---granting-portal-access) page.  As part of that process, partners are able to review and approve the GitLab partner program agreement.  For partners that do not agree to all the terms of the agreement, the Legal Request process is available to negotiate contact terms.

The following are the available partner agreements and addenda:

- Master Partner Agreement (MPA) - This includes the primary terms and conditions for all reseller, services and referral partners.
- Reseller Addendum - The Reseller addendum covers resale and renewal terms and conditions and must be signed by all partners reselling GitLab products and services.
- Referral / Services Addendum - This addendum to the MSA defines the terms and conditions for referral and services payment to partners.  All partners offering services around GitLab or partners referring, but not resellering GitLab must sign this agreement
- Managed Services Provider Agreement - This is a special agreement for any partner that will be offering GitLab managed services.
- Training Partner Addendum - All partners that will be offering GitLab training services utilizing GitLab training materials and train the training programs must sign this addendum.

Copies of the contract templates can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nwh6jt1TYJiida9CJb6YdexIxZZEI5UO?usp=sharing).

Partner agreements are limited to a single region (Americas, EMEA, APAC, Public Sector), unless otherwise approved by Channel leadership.

## Partner Portal Administration

Members of the Channel team are granted access to the Partner Portal Admin Console.  This console enables team members to track partner engagement and view partner data.  Partner data is synched between the Partner Portal and Salesforce, so GitLab team members that have access to Salesforce can find all the partner data there.

The Admin console capabilities include:

1. Engagement metrics - Partner portal engagement metrics, such as logins, asset usage, new accounts and web analytics can be found under the Channel Intel tab.
2. Salesforce sync - Data is synchronized between the Partner Portal and Salesforce in near real time.  As data is updated in one system, it is automatically syned to the other.  The Salesforce team, along with Channel Ops and Programs maintain the synchronization.  The CRM sync is set up under Admin Settings, CRM.
3. Workflows - Workflows are set up to take an action based on a new partner being added to the system or updates to a partner account or user record.  Workflows are found under the Setting tab.  Workflows have been set up to notify team members of a new partner sign ups, automatically provide partners with Portal login credentials, assign journeys, update data fields and other activities.  The Channel Programs team maintains the workflows.
4. Training courses and exams are available for partners in the Portal.  The courses are maintained by Field Enablement and Channel Programs.  Once the GitLab LXP is rolled out to partners, partners will access the LXP through the portal via single sign-on.
5. Journeys are set up to assign a partner a set of specific tasks and activities.  For example, new partner users are assigned an onboarding Journey.  Journeys are set up and maintained by the Channel Programs team.

- Partners will not be able to fully access the partner portal without Agreeing to the Partner Agreement

**Q:  Partner says “I’m not able to login” or “my account has been deactivated”**

**A:**This could be due to a partner not being registered or an individual thinking they registered before. Or it could be an Alliance partner, those partners currently don’t get portal access. Otherwise, we could’ve deactivated them due to inactivity. Try one of these:

1. Check to see if the user exists in Impartner.
   - If not, have them register at partners.gitlab.com.
   - If yes, proceed to the next step.
2. On the Partner Account, check the Partner Status. If this is not “Authorized” or “NDA”, the partner cannot login and should not be activated until they have signed a Partner Agreement. _Only set it to Authorized if the partner signed a contract._
   - _Is Active? field right now should only be marked "true" if:_
     - _Partner Type = Channel_
     - _Partner Status = Authorized (or in rare cases, NDA)_

Please start here to address any issues. This document also includes some of the PHD current state internal processes.

## Partner Services Program Management

## Help Your Partners Become a GitLab Designated Professional Services Partner (PSP)

Step 1: Introduce your partners to the [GitLab Partner Services Program](/handbook/resellers/Channel-Program-Guide/#gitlab-partner-services-program)

Step 2: Set an enablement plan with the partner representative that identifies their key employees who sign up for training and become certified to meet the competency requirements for the program.

Step 3: Build a business plan to incorporate GitLab as a strategic element in their service practice using our [Service Development Framework](/handbook/resellers/services/)

Step 4:  Partner Support team awards partners their designation using GitLab Partner Portal.

## GitLab Professional Services Partner Designation Award Process

GitLab partners who are compliant with the partner program are eligible to become a GitLab Designated Professional Services Partner (PSP).

The requirements for the GitLab Professional Service Partner badge can be found on the [Channel Services Handbook Page](/handbook/resellers/Channel-Program-Guide/#gitlab-partner-services-program).

### GitLab Professional Services Partner Designation Award Process

When a partner completes the PSP criteria, the monthly report will trigger the following in the GitLab Partner Portal:

1. Send the appropriate designation award email to the main Partner contact person listed in the account profile. The award email contains the following elements:
   1. Congratulations
   2. Access to a Badge Graphic Download
   3. Directs partners to our social media sharing kit to help them effectively announce their new certification per our social media kit.
2. The report will automatically trigger the following change in the GitLab Partner Portal parter profile:
   1. Update the partner portal account information with the new designation and date of award
   2. Display the PSP designation on the partner locator for the account.

### GitLab Professional Services Partner Designation Revocation Process

When a partner annual audit identifies a non-compliant PSP, the monthly report will trigger the following in the GitLab Partner Portal:

1. Send the appropriate designation revocation email to the main Partner contact person listed in the account profile. The award email contains the following elements:
   1. Change of status notification message.
   2. Directs the partner to the handbook site for further information on returning to compliance

2. The report will automatically trigger the following change in the GitLab Partner Portal parter profile:
   1. Update the partner portal account information to remove the designation and date of award
   2. Remove the PSP designation on the partner locator for the account.

## Internal NFR Request Processes

**General NFR Request Process**

Partner fills out the NFR License Request form from the "Support" tab within the [partner portal](https://partners.gitlab.com).

This creates a new line in the associated spreadsheet.

Notification is sent from the spreadsheet to anyone who has notifications set up (see **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Set Up Google Form Spreadsheet Notifications</span> [insert link to heading]**).

Partner Help Desk (PHD) reviews request to verify:

- If the partner account is Authorized in Impartner
- If there are any existing NFR licenses - check license.gitlab.com with the partner account name to see if the Partner already has any existing NFR licenses.
  - Select Partners are allowed up to 25 licenses, Open Partners up to 10 licenses
  - If existing licenses, set the expiration date to the same expiration date as existing license (unless this is a renewal of course)
- If the partner has at least one employee who has completed the Solution Architect Certification or Professional Services Engineer Certification training, lab and exam (with a passing score).
  - Check in Impartner for certifications by going to the Training tab
  - Next to the Certification: _Solution Architect Core,_ click the number in the “Completed” column to display all certification completions and sort by account to see if a certification has been completed.
  - Next to the Certification: _GitLab Trusted Professional Services Engineer (PSE) Certification,_ click the number in the Completed column and sort by account to see if a certification has been completed.
  - If the partner has no certifications yet, but meets the other two eligibility criteria above, currently we can still send the NFR license, but we should encourage the partner to complete the Solution Architect Core. See sample email to Partner contact and CAM, once the license has been sent, below:

    ```text
    _Subject Line: NFR License Request_

    _Hi [Partner License Contact],_

    _We just sent you an email with your NFR license, please let us know if you did not receive it._

    _To ensure you receive the most value from this license, we encourage you or someone in your organization to complete the available parts of the Solution Architect Core certification in the Partner Portal._

    _Please let us know if you need anything else._

    _Kind regards,_
    ```

PHD works with partner if additional information is needed.

If verified, PHD follows the **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Creating and Sending NFR Licenses [insert link to heading]</span>**process (i.e. goes to license.gitlab.com and creates new license according to the request submitted in the form).

When submitted, an email with the license is auto-generated to the Contact Email provided and is auto-logged under the Contact Name in Salesforce.

- To confirm the license has been sent, find the Contact Name in Salesforce and then view the Activity History on the contact record. The activity Subject will be _Email: GitLab Ultimate Trial License Key for..._ with the email address and a reference number.

PHD informs requestor license has been sent.

**Creating and Sending NFR Licenses**

1. Once you’ve confirmed the partner is eligible to receive NFR licenses, login to license.gitlab.com
2. Click the green button in the upper right corner “New license”
3. Enter this info at minimum:

   - Name
   - Company
   - Email
   - Users count
   - GitLab Plan = Ultimate (default)
   - Check Trial checkbox
   - Starts at = Today’s date
   - Expires at = 1 year (unless the partner already has existing NFR licenses, then set to the expiration date of the existing license so that all licenses expire the same day and can be reviewed and renewed, if needed, at the same time)
   - Notes = [User count] [GitLab Plan] NFR Licenses for Partner: [Insert Name]

4. Click _Create License_ button

**Access Request to Generate NFR Licenses**

In order to send NFR licenses to partners, you first need to have access to dev.gitlab.org. This access then allows you access to license.gitlab.com, where we issue NFR licenses from.

Select Partners are able to submit MDF requests via the Marketing Page in the Partner Portal. Partners should be reviewing plans with you prior to submitting an MDF request in the Portal to ensure you are aligned with the proposal.

Partner Logos may be accessed in GitLab Partner Portal in the Asset Library under Marketing. Logos are segmented so only authorized Select Partners have access to the Select Logo.

## **Channel Program Engagement Process**

When initiating a project the Channel Team needs to be engaged in each part of the project from ideation to approval.  The Channel Engagement process is depicted in Diagram 1 below:

![Channel Program Engagement Process](/images/channel-program-ops/project-charlies-angels.png)_Diagram 1_

<br>

Once approved we are ready to begin with engagement with Partner Marketing, Partner Enablement, and the [Partner Communication process](/handbook/sales/channel/channel-programs-ops/#partner-communications).

## **Partner Enablement Tools**

The Channel Programs and Enablement team is responsible for the maintence and management of enablement tools used to support the GitLab Partner ecosystem. The three main tools that we use are: Highspot, ImParnter(Partner Portal), and EdCast. Please reference the chart below to determine where an enablement asset should reside.

![Partner Enablement Tools](/images/channel-program-ops/Partner-Enablement-Tools.png)

## **Partner Communications**

The Channel Programs and Enablement team is responsible for “To Partner” Communications.

Partners are a huge part of the GitLab go-to-market strategy.  Teams managing our product, pricing, or process changes should always consider our Partners as it puts them in the best position to be successful with GitLab customers.

GitLab is contractually obligated to provide Partners with **30 days notification** of any pricing, product, or program changes. Product changes to tiering, terms, or EOA must accommodate the 30-day notice before announcing to GitLab customers, so Partners are prepared for changes and to help address customer questions/concerns. The 30 day notification period allows Partners to make required changes to pricelists, company websites, and collateral.   As you create GTM and communication plans, please add extra time for the request to the Channel Program team and account for the required 30-day notification.

If you have something to be communicated to our Partners, kindly submit a **Channel Partner Announcement request** using [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/channel/channels/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Channel%20Partner%20Communication%20Request.md).

For all materials requiring legal review, please refer to the [Materials Legal Review Process](/handbook/legal/materials-legal-review-process)

The Channel Program team has a standard communication cadence and vehicles to deliver notifications to Partners. Please take into account the communication cadence and delivery dates below, we appreciate and encourage as much notification as possible to allow the team to prepare and schedule requests properly.

 **News on Demand - Channel  Partner communication platform!** News on Demand is an add-on product to Impartner, which hosts the Partner Portal.   \
NOD is used to communicate to Partners via targeted emails and the Partner Flash Newsletter. With NOD, we are able to deliver news that is relevant to the individual user. Partners can access news archives and as a contributor, you can add articles at any time. You do not have to stress about deadlines!

**Partner Flash is 100% Targeted** - using groups, we can target the audience of each communication or email. \
  \
**Partner Flash is 100% Personalized**- Partners can choose topic preferences and delivery cadence. They can opt to receive the newsletter Daily, Weekly, Bi-Weekly or Monthly. Partners can also access Partner Flash via the “My News” tab in the Partner Portal.

**Everyone can Contribute!** - Anyone at GitLab can create a story or article for the newsletter! If you would like to be a contributor,[click here](https://partnerflash.gitlab.com/registration/admin/personal_profile) to fill out the request form.  Once approved, navigate to the NOD **Home Page** to access training and helpful tips.

**Partner communication resources and standard delivery dates.**

- **Partner Flash Newsletter** - delivered to Partner users on the **1st Thursday of the month** (occasional exceptions due to holidays or other considerations.) A Partner can elect to receive the newsletter daily, weekly, or bi-weekly. The majority of our Partners receive the newsletter Monthly. If you want to contribute an article, kindly submit it three days before publication.
- **Partner Webcast series** - At times, Channel Programs or Channel Leadership might host a Partner webcast to announce a program change or essential updates.  Channel Marketing hosts a quarterly Marketing Webcast; other Channel facing teams might elect to host a Webcast for our Partners.
- **Partner Portal Notifications** - these alerts can go to all users or a subset; we do not find this a practical stand-alone communication vehicle. Using this notification to augment one of the above resources is more effective.
- **Special Notifications via email** - using NOD we can create a one-off notification if there is an urgent need to communicate out-of-cycle announcements or send surveys or Partner SKO/Summit notifications.  \

**How to get a hold of us:** If you have completed the [engagement process approvals](/handbook/sales/channel/channel-programs-ops/#channel-program-engagement-process) or have any questions regarding if/how something should be communicated, please reach out to us via the **#partner-programs-ops** Slack channel.

**Partner Flash access** - anyone at GitLab can receive Partner Flash or contribute an article.

- **Partners** - automatically signed up when approved and authorized via the Partner Portal.  If a Partner believes they do not have access please provide the user detail: first and last name, email address, and company name in the**#partner-programs-ops** Slack channel, and we will investigate.  Typically we find the Partner has inadvertently opted out of communications.  \

- **Internal teams must self-register to receive Partner Flash and Partner Email communications.**
  - Use [this link](https://partnerflash.gitlab.com/login/) to register; it's pretty straightforward, but check out [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iX23o0N-G25GXfBs82JsmvLw-7Bc0_8e6Cva1o81hX0/edit#slide=id.g127a0ca15c9_0_266) if you need assistance.
  - Important:Use your GitLab email address - not a personal address.
  - Select GitLab employee in the drop-down for "Company Type".
  - Once registered, you will receive an email with instructions on how to edit your communication preferences. \

- **Become a Contributor**- If you want to be a contributor,[click here](https://partnerflash.gitlab.com/registration/admin/personal_profile) and fill out the request form.  Once approved, navigate to the NOD **Home Page**or [click here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YMMQGTk1fhEDLtFAHkrMeIsIbHIYLX3O/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109735377270454778513&rtpof=true&sd=true) to access training and helpful tips.

## **Partner Flash Newsletter**

### Overview

Partner Flash is a monthly newsletter that recaps important Partner-related information from the month and highlights important upcoming information. The main goal of this communication is to **help Partners ramp quickly and grow their GitLab business.**

### Target Audience

The newsletter is sent to authorized users in our Partner community, the list is gathered and updated from the Partner Portal, new users are added automaticly.

### Opportunities/Requirements

The newsletter will…

**Uphold our** [values](/handbook/values/)of transparency and allow anyone to contribute**

- The newsletter is for communication, the Handbook is for documentation. This means that the newsletter will disseminate updates but lean on the Handbook (and other relevant resources) as the main source of documentation, linking back to it wherever possible. Items will also be referenced in the GitLab Partner Portal.

**Prioritize repetition, brevity, user-friendliness and added value**

- The newsletter will focus on short lists and bullet points and will link out to more robust resources.
- Repetition is key to adoption. We will encourage our Channel teams to talk about Partner Flash and will remind Partners in our upcoming Partner Webcast series and on the GitLab Partner portal.
- We want Partners to value the newsletter. A key to adoption will be successfully positioning it as THE resource to learn what's new and recap important information. Everything will be tied back to the payoff to the Partner or seller when possible.
- We must reconcile the fact that this newsletter is yet another increase in communication. We will leverage it to cut down on other communications when possible.

**Be fun to look at and read**

- A focus on multimedia is important in order to help the newsletter break the monotony of text Partners sift through each day.
- We will use images, gifs, emoji, and video where possible. For example, instead of doing a written win-wire, we will interview the individual and embed that 30-60 second video in the newsletter.

**Help the Channel operationalize key messages**

- We will organize information around our 3 main value drivers when possible.
- We will frequently reiterate Sales and Channel messages through video clips and use-case examples.

**Be an opportunity for the Partner Community to "learn themselves"**

- A peripheral goal of the newsletter is to advertise helpful resources to the Partners. We will provide helpful information in hopes that it will encourage them to seek out the source of that information and look for additional information once there.

**Highlight _all_ aspects that make a big win possible**

- There are a lot of new Partners and sales reps who are ramping up on GitLab, we want to provide easy to access to information to help them ramp quickly.
- We will include context around partners and alliances when they play a role in a deal.

**Keep the onus on individuals to stay informed**

- GitLab is asynchronous, this communication is in place to help provide quick access to relevant topics, the newsletter is not a substitute for the Handbook or other resources salespeople should be leveraging on the day-to-day.

**Be general enough to allow us to remain segment-agnostic**

- The newsletter will include general updates and resources that are applicable to most, if not all, Partners. I
- **Be built out in the open**
- The newsletter content will be compiled using the News On Demand platform. Any team member is welcome to contribute or make requests. See more information in the Process section below.

**Uphold our value of "everyone can contribute" we will measure success and gather Partner feedback often.**

- We will measure success using a combination of quantitative and qualitative success metrics. See Measurement section below.
- Giving feedback or making requests will be easy, and all input will be considered and addressed.
- The team is committed to upholding the value of the newsletter – information should be relevant, feedback should be actioned on, and leadership should help reiterate by pointing to it as a useful resource for their teams.

- **Priority Weighting (using Eisenhower matrix and weighted tabs in GitLab)**
  - WEIGHT 1 ~ Channel Priority:1 - Home runs (high value to GitLab and high likelihood of success that align to Sales & Channel OKRs) and committed to completion within stated milestones. This category will be limited because not everything can be a priority. These are both URGENT & IMPORTANT
  - WEIGHT 2 ~ Channel Priority:2 - Big Bets (high value to GitLab, lower time urgency, longer dependencies or lower likelihood of success) within stated milestones. These are not urgent but IMPORTANT to our success
  - WEIGHT 3 - Channel Priority:3 - Small wins within stated milestones. These are URGENT but not strategically important. Delegate or push out
  - WEIGHT 4 - Channel Priority:4 - Small wins that are important but high value. Should be slotted in where backlog allows
  - WEIGHT 5 - Channel Priority:Backlog - Things in the queue not currently being worked LABEL

**DRI** To be stated in intro of issue and assigned to that person. There maybe 1 or more assignee but the DRI should be stated intro of issues
