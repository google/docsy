### Forest Definition in TMF

- TMF focuses on tropical rainforests, therefore not including all types of forests present in these countries.
- Generally, it follows a definition based on:
  - Tree cover density greater than 30%.
  - Minimum tree height of at least 5 meters.
  - Predominantly natural ecosystems, excluding plantations or agroforestry areas.
- **Limitation:** Does not include tropical dry forests, mangroves, or other specific forest ecosystems that may be critical in the region.

### Deforestation Definition

- Based on abrupt changes in forest cover detected by satellite imagery.
- A pixel is considered deforested if it loses the identified forest cover in a given period.
- **Limitation:** May not differentiate between:
  - Permanent deforestation (caused by agriculture or infrastructure).
  - Temporary disturbances (from selective logging or natural regeneration).
  - Forest conversion to other sustainable uses (agroforestry or wooded pastures).

### Spatial Accuracy and Resolution

- TMF resolution is 30 meters (based on Landsat imagery), which may not capture changes in small forests or gradual forest degradation.
- **Limitation:** Does not detect small deforested areas within mixed vegetation mosaics or progressive forest fragmentation.

### Climate Conditions and Clouds

- The tropical region has high cloud cover, which can affect accurate detection of changes in forest cover.
- TMF uses images from different periods to minimize this effect, but some areas may remain without data or have classification errors.
