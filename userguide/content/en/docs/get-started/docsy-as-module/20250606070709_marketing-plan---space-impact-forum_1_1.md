## Plan Overview

### Executive Summary 

summarise key recommendations (objectives, strategy and tactics) plus any other information of note.



### Mission Statement 

Consider the organisation’s purpose – what they do, who they’re for, why they exist and how they operate.



Corporate Objectives
Any functional plan within an organisation is designed to deliver on the corporate objectives, so these are important to know.



Marketing Objectives
These are set in the marketing plan, and if there is a separate digital marketing plan the digital marketing objectives need to support the delivery of these.



Marketing Strategy
Again, this is set in the wider marketing plan. Key information about the target market, as well as competition, growth and positioning will be included that should inform the digital marketing plan.



## Stakeholder Analysis

### Macro-environment

A PESTLE analysis can give insight into opportunities and threats presented by changes in the external environment. If there is an overall marketing plan then this will have been conducted, but a more in-depth analysis of the impact of these external factors in relation to technological and digital activity is beneficial (for example a change in legislation covering data, new means of communication that impact on society or new technology).



### Micro-environment

There are a number of areas to consider here, and again these will have been analysed in the overall marketing plan. 
The focus here will be specifically digital across key areas associated with the micro environment.


### Customers

Who is online? Who can we reach with digital marketing activity?
What digital behaviours do they exhibit?
What is their online customer journey?


### Competitors

What are their current strengths in digital marketing?
What are their current weaknesses in digital marketing? 
Where will they be with their digital marketing in the short, medium and long term?


### Market Forces

Porter’s Five Forces can be a useful tool to consider here. 
Does the technological/digital environment impact on the threats of substitutes and new entrants?
What impact does the technological/digital environment have on the intensity of completion?
What impact does the technological/digital environment have on bargaining power for key stakeholders?


### Internal Analysis

The key focus here is on the strengths and weaknesses of the organisation’s current digital marketing activities. What are they and how do they compare to key competitors?
An analysis of current resource capability is also useful here to determine what capacity the organisation has had for future digital 



### External Analysis

A SWOT summary of key findings from the above can be a useful tool, but a TOWS analysis will give more insight into what these findings mean.
A TOWS analysis considers each of these four elements in relation to each other to generate a wealth of strategic options that can then be prioritised and used to develop objectives.

## Objectives and Strategy

### Objectives

Applying the SMART framework when developing objectives:
Specific – to an audience and/or activity.
Measureable – so performance can be monitored and controlled.
Achievable – the organisation has the resources available.
Relevant – they are appropriate in relation to market conditions and audit findings.
Time bound – there is a period of time within which they should be achieved (which further supports measurability).



### Segmentation Strategy

Segmentation should have already been undertaken within the overall marketing plan and this can be further developed for the digital marketing plan.
The development of a customer, or buyer, persona with a focus on digital behaviour can beneficial here. This will then help inform the decisions made when determining the digital marketing mix.



### Targeting Strategy

Again, this will have been undertaken within the overall marketing plan. 
Within the digital marketing plan the relevant marketing segments are selected for targeting – so who will you target online? The approach to targeting is also identified – differentiated (different approaches for different segments), undifferentiated (the same approach for all segments) or concentrated (focus on a niche market).



### Positioning Strategy

Again, this will be in the overall marketing plan. The positioning of the organisation/brand/product will already have been determined – this is the place that the organisation/brand/product occupies in the mind of the consumer and/or the marketplace. This position needs to be reflected in all digital activity – website, social media, email, content, apps etc.



### Growth Strategy

This will also be considered in the overall marketing plan. The market and product considerations taken when developing growth strategies need to be taken into account and supported in the product mix and targeting strategy.



### Digital Marketing Mix

This section outlines the key elements of the digital marketing mix that will be tailored for the Space Impact Forum, considering both online and offline touchpoints to create a cohesive marketing strategy. Each element must align with the overall marketing objectives while leveraging digital channels effectively.

Measurement – What?

Measurement – How?
What tools/platforms should we use to measure the KPIs?
Do we have access to, and understanding of, these platforms?
Are there any alternative means of measurement?
How will the data be presented?

Measurement – Why?
Why is this KPI important to measure?
What will it tell us?
How can we use these findings in the future to support improved decision making?
