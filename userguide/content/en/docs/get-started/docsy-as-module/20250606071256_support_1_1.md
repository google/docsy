<h1>Getting support</h1>

## Issue queue

The best way to get general support with this platform is to use the [GitHub issue queue](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg/issues).

Check if someone has already [raised a relevant issue](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg/discussions) or use one of the [Open SDG issue templates](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg/issues/new/choose) to:

- let us know about a bug you have found in either your site or data build
- request a new feature
- leave any general comments or questions

The templates contain a few questions which will allow us to sort and prioritise your issue efficiently.

## Google Groups

The Open SDG development team can also be reached by email at [opensdg@outlook.com](mailto:opensdg@outlook.com).

## Specific implementations

To get details on specific implementations of this platform, please check with the maintainers of those implementations. For a list, see the [Community](https://open-sdg.org/community) page.
