Inbound Marketing Handbook
## Inbound Marketing Overview
Inbound Marketing exists to build, grow, and protect the business value created at the top of GitLab’s marketing funnel. Through organic engagement with our content, both on the GitLab website and through other channels, we work to establish mindshare and relationships with existing and potential GitLab customers.
## Measuring Progress
### Website Pageviews
Cumulatively increase pageviews on the GitLab Marketing Website by 20% year-over-year.

## Labels
Labels are important because they help populate the boards and make them work. The minimum viable usage is using `mktg-inbound` and using a scoped `mktg-status` label as shown below.
Meanings and usage
### Team Labels
- `mktg-inbound` 
### Status Labels
- `mktg-status::triage` 
- `mktg-status::plan` 
- `mktg-status::WIP` 
- `mktg-status::blocked` 
- `mktg-status::review` 
### Projects
### Additional Labels
- `IM-Support` 
- `IM-Review-Future` 
## Milestones
Meanings and usage
- `Fri: MONTH DAY` 
- `Inbound Marketing Backlog` 
- `Case Study` 
- `INFORMATION GATHERING` 
## Epics
This is how we use Epics to organize our projects. We aim to include the highest level information at the top level and specific information in lower-level epics. This is to keep a SSoT and avoid duplicative placement of information that would need to be updated in multiple places
- **Top Level Epic** 
- **Second Tier Epic** 
- **Third Tier Epics** 
- **Fourth Tier Epics** 
- **Fifth Tier Epics** 
## Issues
### Issue Types
This is how we work with Issues and their scope
### External
(outside of Inbound Marketing) **REQUEST ONLY ISSUE**
- This is for complicated projects (example: campaign).
- This type of Issue is submitted by a team OUTSIDE of Inbound Marketing.
- This serves as a brief to us.
- For each type of request we have a corresponding **Request [Type] Issue Template** that should be filled out to begin the process. 
- Actions taken on issue: 
**REQUEST AND PRODUCTION ISSUE**
- This is for a simple ask (example: single asset)
- This type of Issue is submitted by a team outside of Inbound Marketing and will contain relevant information for the project AND;
- Execution Items/Production Checklists for the Inbound Marketing Teams.
- For each type of request we have a corresponding **Request [Type] Issue Template** that should be filled out to begin the process.
- Actions taken on issue: 
### Internal
(inside of Inbound Marketing)
**PRODUCTION ISSUE**
- This is an Issue we use internally to create and execute on the request/brief.
- These are only used by people inside of Inbound Marketing
- For each type of request we have a corresponding **Production [Type] Issue Template** that should be filled out to begin the process.
- The teams will deliver the individual pieces to these Issues, but not the completed ask. That should be delivered into the Child Epic created
## Issue Templates

### Internal
