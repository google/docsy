NEW: Watch the video above for a recap of SKO 2021 – a full week (42 hours!) of exciting new content and activities that brought us together and allowed us to celebrate as one team from all corners of the globe. We heard from 75 internal and external presenters who together delivered 94 presentations, all helping us chart the course to reach our Peak Performance together in FY22: land with vision, expand with purpose, attach services, scale with partners and alliances, and retain customers.

Here are the follow-up resources and action items from SKO:

1. **Watch it Again:** You can now relive some of the best moments from SKO! All keynote and breakout recordings are [available in GitLab Learn](https://gitlab.edcast.com/channel/sales-kickoff-sko-2021).

### Did You Know? 🔢

*Policy Summary*

### What's New in GitLab 🚀

The GitLab 13.9 release is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:

- **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk:** Teams no longer have to worry about balancing the security and availability of production environments with the new Security Alert Dashboard, which allows teams to discern between suspicious network activity that needs to be blocked immediately or that only needs further attention, minimizing disruption to users.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** The latest release further supports distributed teams through reduced downtime and increased visibility. This includes GitLab's new Maintenance Mode, which enables read-only availability of customers' instances during admin tasks. This also includes the addition of  Release Analytics at the group level, which continues to grow our support of [DORA metrics](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/devops-metrics/).
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** 13.9 makes the path to "better products, faster" much more attainable with automation that helps identify redundancies in configuration and automation that helps mitigate complexity by making it easier to view pipeline configurations broken into many files and manage deployment processes leveraging parent-child or multi-project pipelines with resource groups.
