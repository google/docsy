### Healthcare

Team members have the option to select Remotes medical insurance through Allianz (for team members only). If they wish to add dependents this will be deducted through the Payroll (usd) $106.50 (for partner), $85.20 (children under 18).

- [Allianz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMw61FsriqRPfcFRQ-mzQsu6HF03IUFB/view)

### Pension

The Swedish Pension is with Nordnet Hållbar/SPP

This plan has required enrollment for all employees. There is no opt-out option.

*Contribution rates are:*

- Pensionable Salary between 0 and 7.5 x the [Income Base Amount (IBA*)](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1130&langId=en&intPageId=4814#:~:text=The%20income%20base%20amount%20is,is%20also%20a%20lower%20limit.) = 4.5% On Pensionable Salary between 7.5 and 30 x the IBA = 30% No contributions are payable on Pensionable Salary above 30 x the IBA.
- The company pays all the contributions and no contributions are required from employees.
- Pensionable salary is defined as Basic Salary only.
- Membership of the pension scheme is open to employees aged 18 to 65.

Example for 2024 Income Base Amount:

An employee with an annual salary of 800 000 SEK.

- the 2024 IBA (income base amount) is 76 200 SEK. This means that 7,5 IBA x 76 200 is= 571 500
- Up to a salary of 571 500 the employee has 4,5% contribution (coming from the employer), and above 571 500 (up to 800 000) they have a 30% contribution. There is also a roof of 30% IBA, so if an employee has an annual salary over 30 IBA (2 286 000 SEK), there would be no contribution beyond that level.
To the top of that amount, 24,26% taxes should be added.

### Life Insurance

Mandatory TGL life insurance is provided via Bliwa Livförsäkring. Lump sum benefit: the basic amount is SEK 285,600 (6 x Price Base Amount – PBA*) upon death before age 55, or after age 55 if there are children under age 17.

### Sick Leave

### Social Security

All workers employed in Mexico must be registered with and contribute to the following institutions that deal with different social security insurance benefits:

- Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS):
  - Provides medical services, child day care, accident and sickness compensation, pregnancy benefits and disability pensions
- National Workers’ Housing Fund Institute (INFONAVIT):
  - Provides subsidized housing to employees as well as loans, and the Retirement Savings Program (SAR). SAR provides employees with retirement benefits when they reach 65 years of age.

Employees in Mexico are covered by the Social Security Law, under IMSS who is responsible for administering social security insurance benefits and the collection of contributions.

- Both the employer and employee are required to contribute to social security, although the employer has the responsibility of withholding the employee’s contribution.
- These contributions fund retirement pensions, health and maternity insurance, occupational risk, day-care, disability and life insurance, and unemployment/old age insurance.

### Medical Benefits

- Healthcare Monthly Allowance will be paid by Remote as an allowance to the team members.
- The allowance will be 5000 USD per annum.
- This amount will be paid on monthly basis with the regular payroll

### Life Insurance

- Life insurance cover provided via Remote. Effective January 1, 2024, all Team Members will be enrolled in the Remote Global Life Insurance plan with a cover level of 200,000 USD at no cost to the team member.

### Monthly Remote Working Allowances

Team members in Mexico will receive a monthly allocation of 1100 MXN for internet and electricity to support their remote work. These reimbursements are tax-exempt and will be reflected as a separate line item on your payslips to cover remote working expenses such as internet and electricity.

- If remote work related expenses for internet and electricity are greater than the 1100 MXN allowance team members can expense the difference for reimbursement. For expenses over the allowance team member's will need to upload all receipts for proper reimbursement.
- Use Expense code: `Work From Home` for the additional expenses.

### Ergonomic Chair Allowance

- Team members are entitled to a one-time claim up to 3000 MXN for the purchase of an ergonomic chair to support their comfort and health while working remotely.
- Follow the reimbursement procedure outlined in the [NAVAN policy](/handbook/finance/expenses/#equipment) for reimbursement.

### Christmas Bonus (Aguinaldo)

- GitLab offers 30 working days pay (which includes total earnings + taxable allowances + commissions)
- Paid by December 20th (so the employee can use it for the holiday)
- Employees with less than one year of service will receive a pro-rated Christmas bonus.

### Vacation Bonus (Prima)

The vacation premium is an additional cash benefit given to employees for use on their vacation. It is calculated as a minimum of 25% of daily salary multiplied by the number of days of vacation. Employees who have provided one year of service must be afforded a minimum of 6 paid vacation days in their first year of employment. Two working days will be added to that vacation time every following year through the fourth year. After five years, employers are required to add two days of vacation time every five years.

- Here is a chart on how vacations days increase:

| Year(s)  | Days |
|----------|------|
| 1        | 6    |
| 2        | 8    |
| 3        | 10   |
| 4        | 12   |
| 5 to 9   | 14   |
| 10 to 14 | 16   |
| 14 to 19 | 18   |

**Calculation:**

- To calculate the vacation bonus based on 25% and a salary of $50,000 USD per year:
- $50,000 USD divided by 365 days = $136.99 USD daily pay rate
- $136.99 USD daily pay rate multiplied by 25% = $34.25 USD
- $34.25 USD multiplied by 6 vacation days (first year) = $205.50 USD vacation bonus
- It can be paid right away when the vacation is taken, or as a lump sum upon completing one year of service (or employment ends). It is the employer’s choice which method to use.
- Unused leave must also be paid when employment ends (in other words, the employee does not ‘forfeit’ unused vacation time)
