## Presenter Guide + Instructions

### Presenter Guiding Principles

1. **Product Focused Highlights:** All presentation materials should be focused on products we plan to launch or evaluating products we have available to customers. Information can be applicable, but should always circle back to the product, gathering customer insights, and demonstrating product value.

1. **Emphasize Dialogue over Monologue:** Structure your presentation to encourage meaningful two-ways discussions. Take pauses, plan specific talking points, and actively seek input.

1. **Prepare Targeted Questions:** Develop 2-3 specific, through provoking questions to engage members in conversation. These questions should be focused on presentation, strategic decisions GitLab is currently grappling in your stage that you would like to gather customer feedback on, or a question related directly to customer workflows. These questions should not be able to be answered with a simple 'yes or no'. We reccomend not to focus too much on hypothetical scenarios that can be difficult for Manager+ to answer since our CAB community are not ICs directly executinf the work within GitLab. 

1. **Connect to Previous Feedback:** Reference previous feedback you have received from advisory meetings in the past. This will help illustrate to CAB members the value of their time and that GitLab takes their recommendations into consideration. Be as specific as possible (within reason) about what actions were taken as a result of feedback.

1. **Prompt Follow Through:** Document key insights and actions items during your session. Your team is responsible for finding a note taker with appropriate context.

1. **Be Prepared:** Be sure to prepare for the meeting ahead of time independently. Please be prepared to share slides as we will not meet as a team to run through the whole presentation to ensure different ways of working are supported and to ensure team effeciency.
