## Overview

## Security Policy

Do not install software with many known security vulnerabilities.

Follow the [Third Party Risk Management Procedure](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/third-party-risk-management/) for review of services individually deployed on endpoint devices. After a decision regarding deployment of an endpoint management solution is made the process will be redesigned accordingly and services, where applicable, will be retroactively reviewed. Please ensure you continue to follow the requirements defined in the [acceptable use policy](/handbook/people-group/acceptable-use-policy/).
