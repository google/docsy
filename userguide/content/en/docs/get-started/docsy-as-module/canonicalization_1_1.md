# Canonicalization

Canonicalization is the process of selecting the representative –canonical– URL of a piece of content

Consequently, a canonical URL is the URL of a page that Google chose as the most representative from a set of duplicate pages. Often called deduplication, this process helps Google show only one version of the otherwise duplicate content in its search results.

**There are many reasons why a site may have duplicate content:**
1. **Region variants**: for example, a piece of content for the USA and the UK, accessible from different URLs, but essentially the same content in the same language
2. **Device variants**: for example, a page with both a mobile and a desktop version
3. **Protocol variants**: for example, the HTTP and HTTPS versions of a site
4. **Site functions**: for example, the results of sorting and filtering functions of a category page
5. **Accidental variants**: for example, the demo version of the site is accidentally left accessible to crawlers

Some duplicate content on a site is normal and it's not a violation of Google's spam policies. However, having the same content accessible through many different URLs can be a bad user experience (for example, people might wonder which is the right page, and whether there's a difference between the two) and it may make it harder for you to track how your content performs in search results.
