title: Work Of A Manager

## The what and the why

_What does your manager do all day? What would it mean to become one?_

This document is about the **what** (and a bit about the **why**). It would take an entirely different - and much longer - conversation to talk about how to do each of these things _well_.

The summary: a manager's job is to build an organization that performs well, efficiently, and sustainably. (I've heard and used the term _well oiled machine._) This is especially important to internalize for ICs (individual contributors, meaning not managers) considering switching to the manager role: _management is not on top of your daily duties; it's an entirely different job._

Can you still do a bit of that old day job, like coding? Sure, but that's a ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù from the perspective of the company. It may be essential to your sanity, so by all means dabble, but this dabbling must not take precedence. Your job is to enable people and build healthy, focused organizations..)

## This document is a framework

Use this document to think about a manager's work. It's intended to focus thought and break up the scope into manageable pieces. It is not intended to be prescriptive or exhaustive as to what you should do. The questions and exercises in this document may or may not have an immediate answer. They're meant to raise questions that you may wish to revisit from time to time.

**Read through and discuss the contents, as well as the results of the exercises, with a mentor or peer manager.**

## The matrix

Managers build the "well-oiled machine" by taking care of their direct and indirect reports, and their larger organization. They must align what the business needs, and what the team (and individuals) need. They must also care for themselves, and ensure growth and sustainability. It's essential for managers to balance day-to-day work with forward-looking work. The needs of the _now_ must be balanced with the needs of upcoming large projects, long-term career planning, staffing, and more.

Use this matrix to organize and visualize these concepts:

|             | Self | Individuals | Organization | Work |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------- | ------------ | ---- |
| Short term  |      |             |              |      |
| Medium term |      |             |              |      |
| Long term   |      |             |              |      |

### The columns

* **Self**: Processes relevant to yourself. Improving yourself as a manager, avoiding burnout, and working on your own career. Also meta-work that enables you to function, from mandatory trainings to tracking your achievements.
* **Individuals**: Processes relevant to individuals. The lives of the people that report to you (directly or indirectly), and any mentees in your charge. Their happiness, skills, careers, goals, and individual productivity.
* **Organization**: Processes relevant to broader collaboration: your team, or your whole organization. Interactions of people, organizational culture and structure, and how the team fits into the overall company landscape.
* **Work:** Processes relevant to the business and its overall goals. OKRs, roadmaps, and the team's deliverables. Picking, planning and organizing what work you will be doing - and, just as importantly, _not_ doing.

### The rows

* **Short term**: Daily work. Something you need to do to keep rolling. All input is already at hand. Effects are immediate.
* **Medium term**: Work that requires you to look forward or backward a few weeks or months. Use that broader perspective to do something, or lay a foundation for future work. Effects are usually realized later.
* **Long term**: Work that requires you to look beyond current commitments (often 6-12 months) to understand long-term needs. Drive strategy, prepare for eventualities, or lay a foundation to prepare you for this work. Effects are usually realized much later, although sometimes long-term goals can become urgent unexpectedly.

## Exercise 1: activities in detail

Take five (okay, 15) minutes and put some activities into each box. Think about _why_: if it's an activity done to keep individuals happy and productive (like actually talking to them from time to time) add it to box **Short term, Individuals**.

No, really. üôÇ You'll see mine after.

## Exercise 2: relative importance of activities

Say you have some tasks ready to go in each box.

* Where should you focus your attention? What about over a longer period?
* What happens if you don‚Äôt do some of this for a day, a month, or a year?
* How do you ensure that nothing important is forgotten?

## Exercise 3: quality control

Where in the matrix was your attention in the recent past? Where _wasn't_ it?

* What was the reason?
* What was the effect?
* What are some situations that require more focus on one box, rather than another?
