# Invited Expert Policy for the Sustainable Web Interest Group

Status: This has been reviewed by the IG Chairs.

# Policy

W3C Invited Experts are individuals who are invited by a chair of a Working or Interest Group to participate in that group. The chair and the W3C staff must agree that the individual brings particular expertise to the group prior to inviting the individual. 

The [Sustainable Web Interest Group charter](https://www.w3.org/2024/10/ig-sustainableweb-charter.html) states that “The group [...] welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration, although active contributors are expected to join the group.”

The Chairs expect to invite individuals to participate in the Interest Group as Invited Experts in a manner consistent with the [W3C Invited Expert policy](https://www.w3.org/invited-experts/) and IG Charter. The Chairs will also take into consideration whether individuals:

* Have participated in the [Sustainable Web Design Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/) and have contributed to the work of that group.
* Have contributed to the Sustainable Web IG (e.g., via the mailing list or GitHub) as non-participants.
* Have expertise that the Chairs deem important to the success of the group, even if they have not previously contributed to either the CG or IG.

Once the Chairs have extended an invitation to someone to join as an Invited Expert, that person should review the [instructions for joining the group](https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/sustainableweb/instructions/).

Individuals are welcome to contact the Chairs to initiate a discussion about participation as an Invited Expert.
