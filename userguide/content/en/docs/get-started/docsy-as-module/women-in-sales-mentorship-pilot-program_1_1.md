## Women in Sales Mentorship Program Pilot

As discussed in [GitLab’s Remote Playbook](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/), the intentionality behind communication, especially in remote settings, is a critical element of success. This pilot program aims to support GitLab’s communications plan by purposefully creating and cultivating opportunities for mentors, mentees, and connection.

The goal of the Women in Sales Pilot Program is to provide mentorship opportunities to women in Sales as a ***pilot***. If successful, we will consider an expansion to other groups across the company. In the spirit of [iteration](/handbook/values/#iteration), we would like to get started soon and expand and improve as we go.

## Program Benefits

***Mentees:***

- Increased visibility with leadership
- Increased professional development opportunities
- Career coaching and guidance
- Opportunity to form relationships with leaders on other teams

***Mentors:***

- Faster feedback loop between team members and leadership
- Opportunity to form relationships with team members in other departments
- Opportunity to support Women at GitLab and live our values

## Program Structure

### 1:1 Coaching Sessions

The program proposes a mentor/mentee relationship between selected applicants on the sales team and mentors in leadership roles across the company. Sessions will take place every other week for 30-minutes and will last for *up to 3 months (with the possibility of an extension)*, as long as both mentors and mentees remain engaged. The mentor/mentee relationship will be cross-divisional, meaning that both parties will have the opportunity to work with and learn from team members outside of your respective divisions.

### Coaching Panels

Every 3 weeks a panelist of mentors will host a `Coaching Panel` to discuss several topics mentees indicated to be of interest as a group. There will be pre-work for mentees prior to Coaching Panels (I.E. reading an article, an expert of the first chapter of a book, etc.) to help stimulate discussion and basic understanding of the topic to be discussed. We will share material to review at least one week prior to the sessions.

Coaching panels will be held over Zoom with Q&A on the identified topic. They will be moderated by the program managers. As Coaching Panels are an extension of mentorship sessions with the wider pilot group, they will not be livestreamed.

Potential Coaching Panel topics include:

| Topic | Explanation  | Panelists| Date  |
|----------------|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Effective Mentor/Mentee Partnerships | Mentee expectations, How mentors can help drive a productive career conversation, identification and selection of a personal development goal | All Mentors | 2020/07/08 |
| Leadership @ all levels in Sales | Goal setting, accountability, influence and collaboration | David Sakamoto, Craig Mestel, Michelle Hodges and Mark Rogge | 2020/08/24 |
| Career Transitions | Transitioning into a manager role; leadership pipeline; career inflection points | Eric Brinkman, Mike Pyle, Robin Schulman and Ryan O'Nell |  2020/10/13 |
| Crucial Conversations | Identifying key conversation moments and how to have those conversations successfully | Michael McBride, Bryan Wise and Danielle Morrill |2020/07/27|
| Work/Life Integration | Balancing family, friends, and careers in leadership | Kristen Lawrence, Dale Brown, Carol Teskey and Brandon Jung | 2020/09/23 |

### Program Communications

All program communications will be sent through the slack channel #women-in-sales-mentorship-pilot including any pre reading before coaching panels.

## FAQ

**Q. Why is this program just for women?**

- A. Across GitLab’s 5 primary divisions (Engineering, G&A, Marketing, Product, and Sales) 4 out of 5 of the divisions have a significantly higher number of men in management roles versus women.
- While each participant will set the priorities for their mentor discussions, we are intentional with this cohort as we encourage discussions to include challenges, opportunities and issues unique to women in sales. We aim to keep removing barriers to those discussions and ensure transparent engagement across GitLab.

**Q. Why is this program just for Sales?**

- A. We needed to chose a place to start to validate that a mentorship model/framework would deliver the intended value to the mentees and mentors. When we looked at the data, women in Sales represented one of the lowest percentages in management and leadership when compared to the other functional areas. Additionally, Women in Sales were vocal about seeking out this opportunity. If this pilot is successful, we hope to expand for our second iteration.

**Q. Does participation in this program guarantee a promotion?**

- A. No, participation in this program does not guarantee a promotion. Benefits for mentees include: Increased visibility with leadership in various areas of the organization, increased professional development opportunities, career coaching and guidance, and opportunity to form relationships with leaders on other teams. You can review these benefits in the [Program Benefits](https://gitlab.com/-/ide/project/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/edit/master/-/source/handbook/people-group/women-in-sales-mentorship-pilot-program/index.html.md#program-benefits) section above.
