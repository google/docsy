# Water Pollution Control Plan

(Aligned with ISO 14001:2015 and related ISO environmental management standards)

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This Water Pollution Control Plan outlines the procedures, responsibilities, and controls for preventing and managing water pollution arising from [Organisation Name]'s activities, products, and services.

It supports our Environmental Management System (EMS) commitment to pollution prevention, legal compliance, and continual improvement in water stewardship.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 2. Objectives

- Identify all significant water pollution sources and risks.

- Implement effective water pollution prevention, reduction, and control measures.

- Ensure compliance with applicable water-related legal and regulatory requirements.

- Monitor, measure, and improve the quality of water discharged.

- Support broader environmental goals related to water conservation, health, and sustainability.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 3. Definitions

- Water Pollution: Introduction of contaminants into natural or artificial water bodies causing harm to living organisms and ecosystems.

- Effluent: Liquid waste or sewage discharged into a water body.

- Stormwater Runoff: Water from precipitation events flowing over surfaces and potentially carrying pollutants into drainage systems and water bodies.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 4. Legal and Other Requirements

The organisation maintains a water-focused legal register including compliance with:

- National water quality standards

- Discharge permits and licenses

- Industrial wastewater treatment regulations

- Surface water and groundwater protection acts

- International agreements (where applicable)

The register is reviewed annually or upon changes in operations.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 5. Responsibilities

- Top Management: Endorse water management policy and allocate necessary resources.

- Environmental Manager: Develop, implement, and update this Water Pollution Control Plan; manage monitoring and reporting obligations.

- Site/Facility Managers: Enforce operational controls; manage contractor compliance.

- All Employees: Follow procedures, minimise water pollution, and report incidents.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 6. Risk Assessment and Identification of Sources

The environmental aspect and impact assessment identifies potential water pollution risks including:

- Process wastewater discharge

- Chemical and fuel storage leakage

- Stormwater runoff contamination

- Cleaning operations

- Construction activities

- Accidental spills

- Sewage or sanitary waste systems failure

Each source is assessed for:

- Type and concentration of potential pollutants

- Volume and frequency of discharges

- Receiving environment sensitivity (e.g., rivers, lakes, groundwater)

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 7. Control Measures

Preventive Actions:

- Design facilities to prevent contact between pollutants and stormwater.

- Store hazardous materials in bunded (secondary containment) areas.

- Implement water-efficient practices to reduce wastewater generation.

Operational Controls:

- Install and maintain on-site wastewater treatment systems.

- Use oil-water separators where necessary.

- Direct clean stormwater and contaminated stormwater through separate systems.

- Schedule regular inspections of tanks, pipelines, and drains for leaks.

Emergency Preparedness:

- Spill response kits available in key areas.

- Emergency response plan for major water pollution incidents.

- Staff trained in containment and reporting procedures.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 8. Monitoring and Measurement

Water quality is regularly monitored to ensure compliance with legal and permit standards:

- Sampling and analysis of effluent discharge (e.g., pH, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), nutrients, metals)

- Stormwater quality testing during significant rain events

- Groundwater monitoring if required (especially for hazardous operations)

Monitoring frequencies:

- Monthly/quarterly testing depending on permits and risk assessments.

- Real-time monitoring where necessary for high-risk discharges.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 9. Records and Reporting

- Maintain records of sampling results, inspections, permits, non-conformances, and corrective actions for a minimum of [Specify Period, e.g., 5 years].

- Immediate reporting of incidents to relevant authorities as required.

- Internal communication of results and trends for awareness and improvement.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 10. Performance Evaluation and Continuous Improvement

- Conduct regular internal audits of water pollution controls.

- Analyse trends to identify improvement opportunities.

- Update environmental objectives and targets annually, focusing on water pollution reduction.

- Implement corrective and preventive actions for any exceedances or non-conformances.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 11. Training and Awareness

All relevant employees and contractors are trained on:

- Sources and impacts of water pollution

- Proper handling of hazardous materials

- Spill response procedures

- Pollution prevention practices specific to their roles

Training records are maintained and refreshed at least every [Specify Period, e.g., 12 months].

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 12. Communication

- Display signage near drains indicating "Only Rain Down the Drain" or equivalent messages.

- Communicate water management efforts through sustainability reports, websites, and public disclosures.

- Engage stakeholders (e.g., community, regulators) on significant water protection initiatives or incidents.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 13. Review and Update

This Water Pollution Control Plan is reviewed and updated:

- Annually

- After significant operational or regulatory changes

- Following major pollution incidents or compliance breaches

Management review includes assessing water pollution performance metrics and lessons learned.

- Water Discharge Register

- Sampling and Monitoring Plan

- Spill Response Procedures

- Training Records Template

- Legal Register (Water Quality Specific)

Would you also like a version that highlights key clauses (like ISO 14001 Clause 6.1.2 "Environmental Aspects", 8.1 "Operational Planning and Control", 9.1.1 "Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis and Evaluation") for a tighter ISO audit match?

It might make it even easier if you're preparing documentation for certification or surveillance audits.
