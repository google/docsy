# 1. Purpose

This Access Control Policy establishes guidelines and requirements for managing access to Green Orbit Digital's information systems and resources. It ensures that access to systems and data is appropriately controlled, monitored, and maintained in accordance with security requirements and business needs.

# 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, third-party service providers, and anyone else who requires access to Green Orbit Digital's IT infrastructure, systems, networks, and data. This includes both digital and physical access to organisational resources.

# 3. Access Control Principles

Green Orbit Digital implements access controls based on the following principles:

- Least Privilege: Users are granted only the minimum level of access required to perform their job responsibilities.

- Need-to-Know Basis: Access to sensitive data and systems is granted only when necessary for business operations.

- Segregation of Duties: Access rights are structured to prevent any single user from having complete control over critical processes.

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access is assigned based on job roles and responsibilities.

# 4. Access Management Procedures

## 4.1 Account Creation

User accounts are created based on the individual's job role and responsibilities. Account creation must be approved by the relevant manager and the IT team.

## 4.2 Authentication Requirements

All users must authenticate through strong means, including:

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical systems

- Complex passwords meeting minimum security standards

- Regular password changes

## 4.3 Access Review and Monitoring

Regular reviews and audits of user access rights ensure:

- Access permissions remain appropriate for roles

- Compliance with internal policies and external regulations

- Detailed audit trails of user activities are maintained

## 4.4 Access Revocation

Access rights must be revoked promptly in the following scenarios:

- Termination of employment

- Change in role or responsibilities

- Security policy violations

# 5. Remote Access

Remote access to Green Orbit Digital's systems must be secured through:

- Company-approved VPN

- Encrypted communication channels

- Multi-factor authentication

# 6. Compliance and Enforcement

Failure to comply with this Access Control Policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contractual agreements. Violations may also expose the organisation to legal and regulatory consequences.

# 7. Review and Updates

This Access Control Policy is subject to periodic review and updates to ensure its continued effectiveness in managing access rights and securing company systems.
