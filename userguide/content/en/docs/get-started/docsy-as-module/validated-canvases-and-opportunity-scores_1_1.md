title: Validated GitLab JTBD Canvases and Opportunity Scores
description: >-
  This page contains links to the JTBD canvases that have gone the GitLab JTBD Playbook process and the top outcome statements and opportunity scores from those canvases.
---

This page acts as the single source of truth for the record of Jobs to be Done canvases that have completed the GitLab Playbook process.

For each canvas / job performer we list each outcome statment that received a score of 10 or higher. As a reminder, we perceive opportunity score as having a severity as explained at the end of the [determine opportunity scores section of the playbook](/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/jtbd-playbook/#step-7-determine-opportunity-scores).
