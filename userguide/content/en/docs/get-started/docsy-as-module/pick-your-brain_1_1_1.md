On this page, we're detailing how the public can request a Pick Your Brain interview focused on all-remote.

## Why we offer public interviews on all-remote

{{< youtube "cy6WGuzArgY" >}}

*An example of an All-Remote Pick Your Brain is embedded above, and can also be seen on the [GitLab Unfiltered YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A).*

*Emna G., founder and CEO at Veamly, speaks with GitLab's [Darren M.](https://twitter.com/darrenmurph) on a number of remote work topics: reinforcing culture, encouraging work-life harmony, remote work processes, the importance of process optimization in team productivity, and asynchronous communication.*

GitLab believes that [everyone can contribute](/handbook/company/mission/#mission). We also believe that all-remote organizations can fundamentally change the world by offering a different way to work. From [reversing](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/remote-benefits/) rural depopulation to providing [opportunity](people/) to a more diverse set of people, we want all-remote to become less the exception, and more the [norm](jobs/).

There is no formal guidebook on building an all-remote company, and what works for a new startup may not map precisely to a larger organization.

While we are [proponents](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/remote-benefits/) of all-remote, we recognize that there are [drawbacks](drawbacks/) as well as individuals who are skeptical about its feasibility. We embrace detractors and those who are inquisitive about making all-remote work. We're interested in hearing about challenges faced by others implementing remote work, so we can ideally find and [document](handbook-first/) solutions.

## Scheduling a Pick Your Brain interview on all-remote

Requests for interviews concerning advice on all-remote may be initiated by completing and submitting [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TNdIIDYRJJGzTlbEN2kI_ok6XV9ieHqk2CtnGla4clw/edit). In the request, please include a brief overview of topics you hope to discuss, along with key questions you're prepared to ask.

These 20 to 30 minute interviews with [GitLab's Head of Remote](https://gitlab.com/dmurph) will be recorded though Zoom and shared on the [GitLab Unfiltered](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A) YouTube channel.

We invite guests to surface challenges and examples as points of discussion. Post-interview, and where applicable, we will iterate on relevant handbook pages to document questions and solutions.

GitLab is a very [transparent](/handbook/values/#transparency) company and many things that are normally confidential can be found in our [handbook](/handbook), available online. Please consider looking at the following pages prior to the meeting.
