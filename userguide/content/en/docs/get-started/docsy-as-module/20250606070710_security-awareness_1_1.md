Security Awareness Policy

1. Introduction

At Green Orbit Digital, we are committed to maintaining a secure working environment where our information, assets, and resources are protected from threats, whether internal or external. Security awareness is a key component of our strategy to safeguard the company’s information and infrastructure, and it is essential that all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers understand the importance of security practices in maintaining a safe digital environment.

This document outlines our approach to security awareness, ensuring that all stakeholders are educated about security risks, best practices, and their role in protecting the company’s assets.

1. Purpose

The purpose of the Security Awareness Policy is to:

Educate employees and stakeholders about the importance of information security.

Promote a culture of security within the organisation.

Mitigate the risks of data breaches, cyberattacks, and other security threats.

Ensure compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards.

Equip staff with the knowledge and tools to prevent security incidents.

1. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, interns, temporary workers, and third-party service providers who have access to Green Orbit Digital’s IT infrastructure, systems, or data. It encompasses all forms of communication and data handling, both digital and physical.

1. Security Awareness Training

To foster a culture of security, Green Orbit Digital requires all employees to participate in mandatory security awareness training. This training should be completed as part of the onboarding process and refreshed regularly to ensure up-to-date knowledge of emerging threats and security practices.

The training programme will cover:

Basic Security Concepts: The importance of safeguarding sensitive data, recognising phishing attempts, securing devices, and strong password management.

Cybersecurity Threats: Common threats such as malware, ransomware, phishing, social engineering, and data breaches, as well as how to recognise and respond to them.

Best Practices: Guidance on securing physical and digital assets, safe internet browsing, proper use of email, and the importance of multi-factor authentication.

Data Privacy and Compliance: Information on data protection regulations such as GDPR and how to handle personal and sensitive data in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements.

Incident Response: Procedures for reporting potential security threats or incidents, as well as steps for mitigating damage in case of a security breach.

1. Security Policies and Procedures

All employees must be familiar with and adhere to Green Orbit Digital’s security policies, which are designed to protect company data and assets. Key policies include:

Password Management Policy: Guidelines on creating strong, unique passwords and using 1Password for password storage.

Data Protection Policy: Guidelines for handling, storing, and sharing personal or sensitive data securely.

Incident Response Policy: Procedures for reporting and responding to security incidents.

Acceptable Use Policy: Rules regarding the appropriate use of company IT systems, including restrictions on using personal devices for work-related activities and prohibitions against accessing non-secure websites or downloading unapproved software.

1. Phishing and Social Engineering Prevention

One of the most common threats in the modern workplace is phishing, where attackers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. As part of our security awareness initiative, all employees will receive training on how to identify phishing emails, suspicious phone calls, or other social engineering tactics. Employees should be encouraged to:

Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails.

Verify the identity of anyone requesting sensitive information through alternative communication channels (e.g., phone call or in-person).

Report any suspicious emails or messages to the IT team immediately.

1. Secure Use of Technology

Employees are responsible for ensuring the security of the devices they use for work purposes. This includes:

Device Security: All work-related devices, including laptops, mobile phones, and tablets, must be secured with strong passwords or biometric authentication. Devices should be locked when not in use.

Remote Work Security: Employees working remotely must use secure, company-approved Virtual Private Network (VPN) services to access internal systems. They should avoid using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks for business activities.

Software Updates: Employees should ensure that their devices are updated regularly with the latest security patches and antivirus definitions.

Data Encryption: Sensitive company data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest, and employees should use approved encryption tools for storing or sharing such data.

1. Reporting Security Incidents

Green Orbit Digital encourages a proactive approach to security, where employees feel empowered to report any potential security incidents or concerns. All employees must:

Report Suspicious Activity: Immediately report any suspicious emails, communications, or activities to the IT department or the designated security officer.

Incident Documentation: Provide as much detail as possible, including email addresses, URLs, and the nature of the suspicious activity, to assist in the investigation and resolution of security issues.

Cooperate with Investigations: Employees must cooperate with any investigations related to security incidents and follow prescribed actions to mitigate further risk.

1. Continuous Improvement

Security awareness is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process. Green Orbit Digital will continuously assess the effectiveness of our security awareness programme and make improvements based on:

Regular Training Updates: Training content will be regularly updated to address emerging threats and the latest security trends.

Security Audits and Assessments: Periodic audits and assessments will be conducted to evaluate the security practices within the organisation and identify areas for improvement.

Employee Feedback: We encourage employees to provide feedback on security awareness training and offer suggestions for improving the programme.

1. Compliance and Accountability

It is the responsibility of all employees to comply with this Security Awareness Policy. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to termination of employment, depending on the severity of the security breach or non-compliance. This policy is aligned with relevant legislation, such as GDPR, and industry standards, such as ISO 27001, to ensure compliance and effective risk management.

1. Conclusion

Security awareness is essential to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Green Orbit Digital’s information and assets. By actively participating in training, adhering to security policies, and promoting a culture of vigilance, every employee plays a crucial role in safeguarding the company from cyber threats. We are committed to ensuring that security awareness remains a core part of our organisational culture, and we will continue to improve our practices to mitigate risks and enhance the overall security posture of the company.
