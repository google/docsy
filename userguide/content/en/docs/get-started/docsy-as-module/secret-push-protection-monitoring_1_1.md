title: "Secret Push Protection Monitoring"
---

### When to use this runbook?

This runbook is intended to be used when monitoring the [secret push protection](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/pre_receive/index.html) feature to identify and mitigate any reliability issues or performance regressions that may occur when it is enabled on Gitlab.com. The runbook can also be used to understand more about relevant dashboards below and how to improve them:

* [Secret Push Protection â€“ Overview Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/secret-push-protection-e28093-overview?orgId=1)

### What to monitor?

While the feature, in its [current form](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/secret_detection/#high-level-architecture), doesn't have any external components and is entirely encapsulated within the application server as a dependency, it does interact with a number of components as can be seen in this [push event sequence diagram](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/secret_detection/#push-event-detection-flow). Those components are:

* GitLab Shell (Git over SSH):
  * `git-receive-pack`
* Workhorse (Git over HTTP/S):
  * `git-receive-pack`
* Gitaly:
  * `SSHReceivePack`
  * `PostReceivePack`
  * `PreReceiveHook`
  * `ListAllBlobs()` RPC
  * `ListBlobs()` RPC
  * `GetTreeEntries()` RPC
* Rails:
  * `/internal/allowed` Endpoint

Below is a sequence diagram showing the entire workflow whether a `git push` takes place over HTTP or SSH:

    Workhorse/GitLab Shell->>+User: outcome of push
```

_Note: `PreReceiveHook` is not to be confused with git's [pre-receive hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#pre-receive). In fact, the former is a [binary wrapper](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/tree/master/cmd/gitaly-hooks) around the actual git hook. Please read more about the [hook setup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/blob/master/doc/hooks.md#hook-setup) in Gitaly's documentation._

These components are therefore the main elements we are trying to focus on when monitoring the feature.

### How we monitor the feature?

As discussed above, the functionality spans a number of components. Therefore, are three main tools we could use for monitoring the feature:

* Kibana (Logs)
  * [Staging](https://nonprod-log.gitlab.net)
    * `pubsub-rails-inf-gstg`
    * `pubsub-gitaly-inf-gstg`
    * `pubsub-workhorse-inf-gstg`
    * `pubsub-shell-inf-gstg`
  * [Production](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net)
    * `pubsub-rails-inf-gprd`
    * `pubsub-gitaly-inf-gprd`
    * `pubsub-workhorse-inf-gprd`
    * `pubsub-shell-inf-gprd`
* Prometheus/Grafana (Metrics)
  * [Internal API](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboards/f/internal-api/internal-api)
  * [Gitaly](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/dashboards/f/gitaly/gitaly-service)
  * [GitLab Shell](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/git-main/git3a-overview)
* Sentry (Error Tracking)
  * [Gitlab.com](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/gitlabcom)
  * [Gitaly](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/gitaly)
  * [Workhorse](https://new-sentry.gitlab.net/organizations/gitlab/projects/workhorse-gprd)

This runbook focuses primarly on the Prometheus metrics available in Grafana, but also shares brief information about other tools and how they could be used. In later iterations, this may change as the feature grows and develops.

### How to check the logs emitted from the feature?

To check the logs emitted from the feature, please look at the following Kibana views:

* ðŸ“– [Kibana: Logs for all scans](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/discover#/view/31afcbb2-28e9-466f-a6c3-486e869e1ee3).
* ðŸ“– [Kibana: Logs for blocked pushes](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/app/discover#/view/db7ba29d-d406-46df-8b43-e6d9c47fbed7).

>**Note:** Kibana [retain logs for only 7 days](/handbook/support/workflows/kibana/#using-kibana).

### How to identify and mitigate a reliability or performance issue with the feature?

The [overview dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/secret-push-protection-e28093-overview?orgId=1) is the main dashboard we have built to monitor the feature. That's where anyone should start to look when trying to identify reliability or performance issues.

The dashboard itself is split into 4 rows (or sections), with each containing a number of panels as below.

#### GitLab Shell (Git over SSH)

This section monitors the stability of certain operations related to the feature within `Gitlab Shell`, which is a set of executables created to handle Git SSH sessions. The tool itself does not handle SSH directly, but instead the SSH server/daemon [`gitlab-sshd`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/gitlab_shell/gitlab_sshd.html) maintain all connections with clients and calls up Rails via GitLab Shell to perform authorization or access checks. Please check [this diagram](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/gitlab_shell/index.html#git-push-over-ssh) and [this description of a request cycle](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/architecture.html#ssh-request-22) for more information on how that works.

The section can be used to ensure there are no performance degradations related to `git-receive-pack` operations when a `git push` operation is carried out over SSH. It is dividend into two rows/sections as follows.

**Note**: Most of available metrics for both `gitlab-shell` and `gitlab-sshd` aren't aggregated by the command used, so for a more better overview of the performance of `git-receive-pack` operation, take a look at the Kibana logs linked in those sections instead.

##### gitlab-shell

#### Workhorse (Git over HTTP/S)

This section monitors the stability of certain operations related to the feature within `Workhorse`, which is a smart reverse proxy intended to handle resource-intensive and long-running requests. It intercepts all HTTP requests and either propagates them without changing or handles them itself by performing additional logic. Please check [this diagram](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/workhorse/handlers.html#git-push) and [this description of a request cycle](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/architecture.html#web-request-80443) for more information on how that works.

The section can be used to ensure there are no performance degradations related to `git-receive-pack` operations when a `git push` operation is carried out over HTTP/S.

**[Processed `/.git/git-receive-pack` Requests](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/secret-push-protection-e28093-overview?orgId=1&viewPanel=2)**

This panel displays the number of HTTP requests that have been processed by `workhorse` over time, increasing in range of 24 hours. The panel partitions these requests by the HTTP verb/method and response code. This panel can be used to determine if the amount of `git-receive-pack` requests with a response code that isn't `200` had increased recently, indicating an issue with processing such requests.

#### Gitaly

This section monitors the stability of `gitaly`, a tool providing high-level RPC access to `git` repositories. We focus in this section on the hooks and RPCs used by the feature. This can be used to ensure there are no performance degradations related any of them.

The section is divided into four sub-sections as follows, with most focus being on latency.

1. GitLab Shell <=> Gitaly:
    * `SSHReceivePack`
1. Workhorse <=> Gitaly:
    * `PostReceivePack`.
1. Gitaly <=> Rails API:
    * Gitaly / Before `/internal/allowed`:
        * `PreReceiveHook`.
    * Gitaly / During `/internal/allowed`:
        * `ListAllBlobs()` RPC
        * `ListBlobs()` RPC
        * `GetTreeEntries()` RPC

##### GitLab Shell <=> Gitaly

**[PostReceivePack â€“ Average Latency [All Hosts]](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/secret-push-protection-e28093-overview?orgId=1&viewPanel=36)**

This panel displays the average latency on all hosts in milliseconds for calls to the `PostReceivePack` RPC, which is the RPC responsible for calling `git-receive-pack` command, that in turn executes the `PreReceiveHook`. The latter goes on to call `/internal/allowed` endpoint that runs access checks on Rails side.

_Panel Information_

* Metric: `gitaly:grpc_server_handling_seconds:avg5m`
* Label Filters:
  * `job` = `gitaly`
  * `grpc_method` = `PostReceivePack`
* Operations:
  * Avg: `1000 * avg`
* Legend:
  * `{{method}}`

##### Workhorse <=> Gitaly

**[SSHReceivePack â€“ Average Latency [All Hosts]](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/secret-push-protection-e28093-overview?orgId=1&viewPanel=37)**

This panel displays the average latency on all hosts in milliseconds for calls to the `SSHReceivePack` RPC, which is the RPC responsible for calling `git-receive-pack` command (for git push over SSH), that in turn executes the `PreReceiveHook`. The latter goes on to call `/internal/allowed` endpoint which runs access checks on Rails side.

_Panel Information_

* Metric: `gitaly:grpc_server_handling_seconds:avg5m`
* Label Filters:
  * `job` = `gitaly`
  * `grpc_method` = `SSHReceivePack`
* Operations:
  * Avg: `1000 * avg`
* Legend:
  * `{{method}}`

##### Gitaly <=> Rails API

###### Gitaly / Before `/internal/allowed`

**[PreReceiveHook â€“ Average Latency [All Hosts]](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/secret-push-protection-e28093-overview?orgId=1&viewPanel=38)**

This panel displays the average latency on all hosts in milliseconds for calls to the `PreReceiveHook` hook, that in turn calls `/internal/allowed` endpoint to runs access checks on Rails side.

_Panel Information_

* Metric: `gitaly:grpc_server_handling_seconds:avg5m`
* Label Filters:
  * `job` = `gitaly`
  * `grpc_method` = `PreReceiveHook`
* Operations:
  * Avg: `1000 * avg`
* Legend:
  * `{{method}}`

###### Gitaly / During `/internal/allowed`

**[ListAllBlobs â€“ Average Latency [All Hosts]](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/secret-push-protection-e28093-overview?orgId=1&viewPanel=10)**

This panel displays the average latency in milliseconds for all calls to the `ListAllBlobs` RPC, which is responsible (within the context of the feature) for enumerating all blobs of a repository under a certain size limit (i.e. exactly 1MiB). This procedure is usually fast because it is mostly used with the size limit set to 0 for checking file sizes of blobs in a certain git push.

_Panel Information_

* Metric: `gitaly:grpc_server_handling_seconds:avg5m`
* Label Filters:
  * `job` = `gitaly`
  * `grpc_method` = `ListAllBlobs`
* Operations:
  * Avg: `1000 * avg`
* Legend:
  * `{{method}}`

**[ListBlobs â€“ Average Latency [All Hosts]](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/secret-push-protection-e28093-overview?orgId=1&viewPanel=11)**

This panel displays the average latency in milliseconds for all calls to the `ListBlobs` RPC, which is responsible (within the context of the feature) for enumerating all blobs of a repository under a certain size limit (i.e. exactly 1MiB), similar to `ListAllBlobs`, but it also loads up file paths for those blobs. The procedure is often slower than `ListAllBlobs` because it loads up blob contents when enumerating them.

_Panel Information_

* Metric: `gitaly:grpc_server_handling_seconds:avg5m`
* Label Filters:
  * `job` = `gitaly`
  * `grpc_method` = `ListBlobs`

#### Rails

This section monitors the stability of the [`/internal/allowed` endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/internal_api/internal_api_allowed.html) which is a focal point in the feature's journey to protect against leaked secrets in a `git` push. The endpoint is part of GitLab's [Internal API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/internal_api/), and is responsible for assessing if a user has permission to perform certain operations on the repository.

The section can be used to ensure there are no performance degradations related to the `/internal/allowed` endpoint when changes in a certain `git` push are scanned for secrets.

**[Internal API / Request Latency](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/secret-push-protection-e28093-overview?orgId=1&viewPanel=40)**

This panel displays the average, p95, p99, and mean latencies for requests made to the `/internal/allowed` endpoint over time. The panel can be used to monitor request latency and understand if there's a performance or scalability issue with that specific endpoint. Use the link for more detailed overview of this metric.

**[Internal API / RPS (Requests Per Second)](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/secret-push-protection-e28093-overview?orgId=1&viewPanel=41)**

This panel displays average number of requests per second (RPS) made to the `/internal/allowed` endpoint over time. The panel can be used to monitor request rates and understand if there's a performance or scalability issue with that specific endpoint. Use the link for more detailed overview of this metric.

**[Internal API / Memory Saturation Rate](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/fdk7i56zibv28d/secret-push-protection-e28093-overview?orgId=1&viewPanel=42)**

This panel displays the memory saturation rate for two components of the internal API, which are [Ruby VM](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/goto/ptHVRjsIR?orgId=1) and [Puma Workers](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/goto/dJXnRjyIR?orgId=1). This is helpful to understand if the memory consumption in Rails had increased to the point of saturation, which indicates a performance and a scalability issue and requires attention. Note: this panel isn't specific to `/internal/allowed` endpoint.
