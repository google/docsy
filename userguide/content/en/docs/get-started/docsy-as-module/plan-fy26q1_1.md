---

## Overview

This action plan outlines our strategy to launch 7 new Co-Create projects in FY26Q1. The plan establishes processes for identifying high-potential customers, engaging effectively, and ensuring successful project delivery. Our ultimate goal is to foster continuous contributions that fuel our dual fly-wheel approach, transforming initial projects into long-term contribution relationships.

## Customer Segmentation Process

Customer segmentation helps us identify organizations most likely to successfully participate in Co-Create. By analyzing multiple criteria, we can focus our resources on customers with the highest probability of contributing meaningful features to GitLab.

### Prioritization criteria for customer selection

- Number of public issues and merge requests created
- Usage of specific GitLab features
- Current subscription tier and seat count
- Industry sector focus (Finance, Manufacturing, Telco)
- Previous open source contribution experience
- GitLab usage growth trends
- Customer relationship strength

### Data Collection

- Review Co-Create tracking data
- Document data sources
- Validate selection criteria with team
- Identify data gaps

### Customer Tiering

- Tier 1: High engagement potential
  - Strong issue/MR history
  - Premium/Ultimate subscription
  - Prior contribution experience
- Tier 2: Medium engagement potential
  - No previous MR history, but clear overlap between customer and GitLab tech-stack
- Tier 3: Future potential

## Outreach Process

A structured outreach process ensures consistent communication and sets clear expectations with potential Co-Create participants. This process leverages our existing customer relationships while maintaining a healthy pipeline to achieve our quarterly goals.

### Target Selection

- Focus on existing account team relationships
- Prioritize top 25 scored customers
- Maintain 3x target pipeline (21+ prospects)

### Engagement Steps

- Track contribution patterns across Co-Create participants
- Incorporate contribution / co-create activity into regular business reviews

- Projects initiated
- Time from contact to project start
- Post-project contribution activity (new MRs, issues, comments)
