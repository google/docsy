At Green Orbit Digital, we uphold the highest standards of ethics and integrity in all aspects of our operations.

- Criminal activities

- Health and safety hazards

4. Protection for Whistleblowers:

- Whistleblowers are protected under the law, including the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, which prohibits victimization or dismissal of employees who report concerns in good faith.

- Green Orbit Digital is committed to providing support and protection to whistleblowers, including protection from harassment or victimization.

- Any instances of harassment or victimization against whistleblowers will be treated as serious disciplinary offenses and will be dealt with accordingly.

5. Reporting Procedure:

- Concerns should be raised with the People and Office Manager or one of the Directors of Green Orbit Digital.

- Whistleblowers may report concerns via email, telephone, or in person.

- Whistleblowers should provide detailed information about the nature of their concerns, including relevant background information and any evidence available.

- Whistleblowers may choose to raise concerns anonymously, although doing so may limit the effectiveness of the investigation.

6. Handling of Concerns:

- Upon receiving a concern, Green Orbit Digital will conduct an initial assessment to determine the appropriate course of action.

- Investigations will be carried out promptly and impartially by management or designated personnel.

- Whistleblowers will be kept informed of the progress and outcome of the investigation to the extent possible, while maintaining confidentiality.

7. Support and Confidentiality:

- Whistleblowers will receive full support from the People and Office Manager and Directors throughout the reporting and investigation process.

- All concerns will be treated with the utmost confidentiality, and whistleblowers' identities will be protected to the fullest extent possible.

- Records of concerns, investigations, and outcomes will be maintained confidentially and securely by Green Orbit Digital.

8. Taking Matters Further:

- If whistleblowers are not satisfied with the outcome of the investigation, they may choose to escalate the matter externally to the police, trade union representatives, or legal authorities.

- This policy does not prevent whistleblowers from seeking their own legal advice if necessary.

9. Record Keeping:

- Green Orbit Digital will document and keep records of all concerns raised, investigations conducted, and outcomes reached.

- These records will be stored confidentially and will only be accessed when required for investigative or compliance purposes.

Conclusion:
Green Orbit Digital is committed to fostering a culture of transparency, integrity, and accountability. Through the implementation of this whistleblowing policy, we aim to create a safe and supportive environment for reporting concerns and addressing issues of wrongdoing or misconduct. We encourage all employees and stakeholders to speak up if they become aware of any actions that violate our values or principles, and we are committed to taking prompt and appropriate action to address such concerns.
