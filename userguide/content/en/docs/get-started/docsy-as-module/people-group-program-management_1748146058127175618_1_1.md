## Overview

Program Managers keep our division aligned on what success looks like, how to measure it, and what steps are required to achieve our goals. Through effective management of programs and projects, this group keeps us on track, organized, and driving towards our most impactful business results. By staying closely connected, this function supports our ability to remain agile, iterative, and connected through cross-functional and team-specific projects.

We have various Program Management roles across GitLab. Within the People Group, Program Managers report directly to the team they support to ensure they are as close as possible to their core areas of responsibility, team, and focus.

The goals of this page are to:

- Generate more awareness around Program Manager roles in the People Group
- Create consistent Program Management practices within the People Group
- Drive further cross-departmental connection, alignment, and awareness
- Facilitate internal networking for learning and connection amongst individuals in these roles
- Provide a space for knowledge-sharing and learning

## Key Competencies

Regardless of the team, our Program Management key competencies are consistent to ensure the function at its core remains aligned. While the job families remain the [SSOT](/teamops/shared-reality/#single-source-of-truth-ssot) for roles across GitLab, a few key competencies and behaviors to expect from all Program Managers within the People Group are:

| Key Competency | Behavior |
| ------ | ------ |
| Subject matter expertise | Guides and oversees programs and projects within their functional area of expertise. |
| Effective communication | Provides regular project status updates to stakeholders through effective communication; maps team projects and the status of various projects for stakeholder visibility. |
| Growth mindset | Ensure we remain iterative and continue to grow and improve (e.g. facilitate retrospectives, and optimize where possible). |
| Change management | Supports change management when needed and can quickly facilitate or pivot changes in schedule or timeline. |
| Stakeholder management | Keeps project teams and stakeholders aligned and accountable for executing deliverables. |
| Strategic planning | Ensures work aligns with the division's and organization's overall goals. |
| Program management methodologies | Research, discovery, and documentation of current state processes and workflow. Creates and maintains the project plan in collaboration with team members and helps identify, mitigate, and escalate risks and issues. |

### Determining Drive

As our Program Management function in the People Group continues to expand, we anticipate that we will encounter situations where we have multiple Program Managers involved in the same programs or projects. When these situations arise, the Program Manager aligned to the team that is the project or program DRI will be the primary Program Manager and responsible for managing end-to-end program management. Other Program Managers should approach the program as a partner from the lens of the group they are aligned with, collaborating closely with the DRI Program Manager.
