This is a great interactive activity to get you thinking about Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.

**The Goals and learning objectives are as follows:**

- To acknowledge and investigate privilege.
- To provide an opportunity for team members to connect and reflect on the experience of having (or not having) privilege.
- To discuss the variety of privileges that underrepresented groups have limited access to. Not just legal privileges but social, financial, etc.
- To discuss how no one privilege is more important than another, that for someone any privilege may feel essential.
- Team members will be able to identify privileges that they take for granted in their everyday life.
- Team members will discuss what types of privileges (social, financial, legal, etc.) are important to them and why that may differ from others in their group.
- Team members will be able to investigate and discuss what groups may have limited access to what privileges and effect that lack of access may have on an individual.
- In the activity you have a list of privileges, you do not have any of these privileges, for the purpose of this exercise.

## Best Practices

### For Facilitators

- **Scheduling:** Use Google Calendar's [group scheduling feature](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fKQSeuNQc08ZRZf68IioKEhH7E07pec-/view?usp=sharing) (`Meet with...`), located to the left of the calendar, to find a time that works for all participants. Schedule a 50 min meeting, or longer, if participants are able and willing.
- **Preparing for the roundtable:** Create a copy of this suggested [facilitator template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BlIYfqtMWIkJUulqZYsgNq5_3bKihdyb5fGOeOpZVxI/edit#) and share it with participants only (do not share with "everyone at GitLab" since the DIB Roundtable is a safe space, with information shared needing to stay just between the group participants). Add in participant's names where relevant in the doc (e.g. `Participant 1's list`).
- **How to facilitate:** A possible way to facilitate the Privilege for Sale activity is to ask everyone to take a few mins to choose their top 10 in the lists you've prepared for them. When they are finished, ask them to add a `+ Initial` to the group list (e.g. "You are able to feel safe" +N, +P, +D, +S). This will help you visually see which privileges are the most popular and may help you to begin the conversation.
