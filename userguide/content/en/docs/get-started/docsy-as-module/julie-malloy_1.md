## Why I'm at GitLab

For me, being at GitLab represents the perfect blend of doing a job I truly enjoy at a fast-paced, growing company with tremendous market potential. What makes it especially rewarding is the opportunity to tackle complex challenges alongside exceptionally talented people who embody GitLab's core values. I feel incredibly fortunate to collaborate daily with such high-caliber colleagues in an environment and culture where everyone can contribute.

## My Personal Values

1. **Achievement** - A sense of accomplishment is at the core of what motivates me. But it's more than just checking boxes off my own to-do list. I want to build an environment where everyone's shooting for the stars and we celebrate our team’s victories. I thrive alongside colleagues who share this enthusiasm for excellence and pushing boundaries.
1. **Collaboration** - I've learned that the best outcomes often emerge when we work together, combining different perspectives and expertise. Collaboration isn't just about working side by side; it's about actively engaging with team members, ensuring buy-in from all stakeholders, and creating an environment where diverse ideas are welcomed and respected.
1. **Integrity** - Integrity is all about being honest, ethical, and doing the right thing. When integrity is a key value, it guides how everyone in the team behaves and makes decisions. It’s about being consistent in what you say and do, building trust, and leading by example.  Integrity is essential in all my work relationships and how I expect my team to operate. 

## My Super Powers - how you can get the best from me

1. **Bias for Action** - I want to get things done. I'm not content with just discussing or planning - I drive toward concrete results. When faced with obstacles, I focus on finding solutions rather than dwelling on problems. 
1. **Positive Approach** - I see opportunities where others might see roadblocks. This doesn't mean I ignore problems, but rather I choose to focus on solutions and potential positive outcomes. I believe that maintaining a constructive attitude creates an environment where innovation and progress can be the norm.
1. **Curiosity** - I ask a lot of questions because that is simply how I learn.  It’s my process to help me understand root causes, explore multiple perspectives and ultimately explore different aspects to find the best solution. I genuinely enjoy uncovering how things connect and work together. This drive to truly understand things, rather than just scratching the surface, often leads to insights that we might otherwise miss. 

## My Weaknesses

1. **Impatience** - I have a strong bias for action and results, which can manifest as impatience when project deadlines are at risk, deliverables lack a clear timeline or progress appears to be slowing or stalling.
   - How to help me manage this: Flag potential delays early so we can problem-solve proactively. If you need more time, provide context and a revised timeline
1. **Reaction to Roadblocks** - While my optimistic mindset drives results, I sometimes need to better manage my response to perceived roadblocks.  I tend to quickly “shut down” when I hear no or it can’t be done. Everything can be accomplished to some degree, just not maybe how it was originally envisioned or within the desired timeframes. 
   - How to help me manage this: Come to me with solutions that may not be a perfect fit or bring others in to help work through alternatives. 
1. **Curiosity** - Because I ask a lot of questions, it can be misinterpreted as distrust or me doubting your understanding of your subject. That is not my intent
   - How to help me manage this: direct me to source information upfront to help me get up to speed or set up time 1:1 so we can delve deeper without an audience.  

## My Expectations of Everyone

1. **Accountability**: Taking ownership of your work is fundamental to our success. This means: delivering high-quality work that meets or exceeds standards, following through on commitments and deadlines, acknowledging mistakes and course correcting, being transparent about progress and potential roadblocks.
1. **Proactiveness**: Success requires thinking beyond the immediate task. This can manifest in many ways: anticipate potential challenges and prepare contingency plans, identify opportunities for process improvement and efficiency gains, question existing practices or why we need them and stay current with industry trends in your area.  
1. **Business Partnership**: our team is here to make GitLab successful. We facilitate Sales orders, negotiate Vendor contracts and administer equity, pay sales people, etc. - there isn’t  a function in the company that we do not interact with on a regular basis.  I expect our team to be thought of as trusted business partners. That means collaborating, getting answers even if it’s not in our immediate scope, acting with a high level of responsiveness, listening to stakeholders needs and being an expert in your function.

## My Role

1. I am the Vice President of Accounting Operations at GitLab.
1. Our finance mission statement is **We deliver timely and accurate financial information to enable optimal decision making to increase shareholder value.**
1. My role is to build an exceptional finance operations team that supports GitLab's business and growth through streamlined processes, automation and high quality output while creating an environment where everyone feels supported.

## Communication Preferences

1. I prefer Slack to email, but I check all forms of communication often, even when OOO. 
1. If you need something urgently, text or phone is the best method to reach me. 
1. Please contact Sarah Hobbs, my EBA, if you need help getting time on my calendar.
1. Meetings should have a prepopulated agenda.
1. My SLA is within a day. If there is something that you will urgently need when I am OOO, please plan ahead of time so we can coordinate

## Expectations for leadership - What I need from you. What you will get from me

1. Be open to change and new ideas. I will throw a lot of ideas your way - some will land and some won’t, but that’s not the point. Companies don’t grow if they stay stagnant - they have to evolve to what is going on around them. 
1. Don’t live in your “lane.” Try to understand your stakeholders needs, what your peers perspective is…it will make you a better business partner. 
1. I am always transparent and do my best to communicate. Please do the same. 
1. If you need help, ask for it. I want all of you to be successful. 
1. I will support you to the best of my ability. I ask that you support each other as a team. 

## FAQs

1. What do you do outside of work? 
   - Family and friends are top of my list. Being active is super important to me which means everyday involves something: running, bootcamp, hiking or a long walk. I volunteer at a community farm which is a great way to spend a few hours away from spreadsheets.  Traveling, a fun concert and trying something creative are things that get me out of my work zone!
