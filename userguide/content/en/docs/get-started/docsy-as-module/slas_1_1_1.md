{{% alert title="Zendesk calls them service level agreements, we do not" color="danger" %}}

What appears here is all titled service level agreements, or SLAs, but many of these are internal service level objectives, or SLOs, instead. They are titled as service level agreement, or SLA, because that is what Zendesk calls the setting. Nothing detailed herein is an actual, legal service level agreement.

## What are Zendesk service level agreements?

As per [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408829459866-Defining-SLA-policies):

> A Service Level Agreement, or SLA, is an agreed upon measure of the response and resolution times that your support team delivers to your customers. Providing support based on service levels ensures that you're delivering measured and predictable service. It also provides greater visibility when problems arise.
