# socket.io flow
Sure! Let me break down the **Socket.IO flow** and explain the role of each line of code. This will give you a detailed understanding of how everything works in both the **server** and **client** code.

---

## **Overview of Socket.IO Flow**
Socket.IO enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients. Hereâ€™s the typical flow:

1. **Connection**: A client connects to the server via a WebSocket.
2. **Joining Rooms**: Clients can join specific "rooms" (or groups) to organize messages and events by context (e.g., chat groups).
3. **Event Communication**: Clients and the server exchange custom events. For example, `sendMessage` can be an event to share messages.
4. **Disconnection**: A client can leave rooms or disconnect, and the server cleans up.

---

## **Server-Side Code**
This is your `server.js` (or related module). Letâ€™s go through it **line by line**:

```javascript
module.exports = (io) => {
    io.on("connection", (socket) => {
        console.log("A user connected:", socket.id);
```
- **`io.on("connection")`**: Listens for a new client connection. Each time a client connects, the callback function runs.
- **`socket.id`**: A unique ID is assigned to every client when they connect. It helps track individual users.

---

### **Joining a Room (Group)**
```javascript
socket.on("joinGroup", (groupName) => {
    socket.join(groupName);
    console.log(`User ${socket.id} joined group: ${groupName}`);

    io.in(groupName).fetchSockets().then((sockets) => {
        console.log(`Sockets in ${groupName}:`, sockets.map((s) => s.id));
    });

    io.to(groupName).emit("userJoined", {
        message: `A new user has joined the group: ${groupName}`,
        groupName,
        userId: socket.id,
    });
});
```

1. **`socket.on("joinGroup", (groupName))`**: Listens for the `joinGroup` event from the client. This event sends the group name the user wants to join.
2. **`socket.join(groupName)`**: Adds the socket (client) to a specific "room" identified by `groupName`. Rooms are logical groups of sockets.
3. **`io.in(groupName).fetchSockets()`**: Fetches all sockets (clients) currently in the specified room.
4. **`io.to(groupName).emit("userJoined", { ... })`**:
   - Sends a broadcast message to all sockets in the room (including the new user).
   - The `userJoined` event is sent to notify others about the new user.

---

### **Handling Messages**
```javascript
socket.on("sendMessage", ({ groupName, message, card }) => {
    console.log(`Message to ${groupName}: ${message}`);
    io.to(groupName).emit("sendMessage", {
        message,
        card,
        groupName,
    });
});
```

1. **`socket.on("sendMessage", callback)`**: Listens for the `sendMessage` event from a client. The client sends `groupName`, `message`, and `card` as data.
2. **`io.to(groupName).emit("sendMessage", { ... })`**:
   - Broadcasts the message to all sockets in the specified room (`groupName`).
   - The event name (`sendMessage`) and the message data (`{ message, card, groupName }`) are sent to clients in the group.

---

### **Leaving a Room**
```javascript
socket.on("leaveGroup", (groupName) => {
    socket.leave(groupName);
    console.log(`User left group ${groupName}`);
    io.to(groupName).emit("userLeft", {
        message: `A user has left the group: ${groupName}`,
        groupName,
        userId: socket.id,
    });
});
```

1. **`socket.on("leaveGroup")`**: Listens for the `leaveGroup` event from the client.
2. **`socket.leave(groupName)`**: Removes the socket from the specified room.
3. **`io.to(groupName).emit("userLeft", { ... })`**:
   - Broadcasts a `userLeft` event to the group to inform other members that a user has left.

---

### **Handling Disconnection**
```javascript
socket.on("disconnect", () => {
    console.log("User disconnected:", socket.id);
});
```

- **`socket.on("disconnect")`**: Automatically triggered when a client disconnects (e.g., closes the browser).
- **`socket.id`**: Logs the ID of the disconnected user.

---

## **Client-Side Code**
Letâ€™s go through the client-side logic line by line.

---

### **Connecting to the Server**
```javascript
const socket = io();
```
- **`io()`**: Initializes a WebSocket connection to the server.

---

### **Joining a Room**
```javascript
socket.emit("joinGroup", `team-${projectId}`);
```
- **`socket.emit("joinGroup", ...)`**: Sends the `joinGroup` event to the server with the group name (e.g., `team-123`).
- The server will handle this and place the user in the appropriate group.

---

### **Sending a Message**
```javascript
socket.emit("sendMessage", {
    groupName: `team-${projectId}`,
    message: messageText,
    card: cardNum,
});
```
- **`socket.emit("sendMessage", ...)`**: Sends the `sendMessage` event to the server. Includes the group name, the message text, and the card ID for context.
- The server will broadcast this message to all users in the specified group.

---

### **Receiving Messages**
```javascript
socket.on("sendMessage", (data) => {
    const { message, card } = data;
    const messageList = document.getElementById(`message-list-${card}`);
    if (messageList) {
        const messageItem = document.createElement("li");
        messageItem.textContent = message;
        messageItem.className = "p-2 border-b";
        messageList.appendChild(messageItem);
    }
});
```

1. **`socket.on("sendMessage", callback)`**:
   - Listens for the `sendMessage` event from the server.
   - When a message is received, it is displayed in the appropriate chat interface.

---

### **Leaving a Room**
```javascript
socket.emit("leaveGroup", `team-${projectId}`);
```
- **`socket.emit("leaveGroup", ...)`**: Sends the `leaveGroup` event to the server. The server will remove the user from the room and notify others.

---

## **Flow of Events**
### 1. **Joining a Chat Group**
- Client emits `joinGroup`.
- Server:
  - Adds the client to the room.
  - Broadcasts a `userJoined` event to the group.

---

### 2. **Sending a Message**
- Client emits `sendMessage` with group details and message text.
- Server:
  - Broadcasts the message to all clients in the group via `sendMessage`.

---

### 3. **Leaving a Chat Group**
- Client emits `leaveGroup`.
- Server:
  - Removes the client from the room.
  - Broadcasts a `userLeft` event to the group.

---

### 4. **Receiving Messages**
- All clients in the group receive the `sendMessage` event and update their UI accordingly.

---

### **Why This Flow Works Best**
- **Rooms (Groups)**: Efficiently segment users into logical groups without needing multiple connections.
- **Events**: Named events (`sendMessage`, `userJoined`, etc.) ensure clear communication.
- **Broadcasting**: Server broadcasts messages only to relevant users in the room, improving performance.
