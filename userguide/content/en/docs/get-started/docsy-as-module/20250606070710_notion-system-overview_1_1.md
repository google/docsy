Green Orbit Digital leverages Notion as its central operations hub, designed for scalability, clarity, and agility. This playbook details how our workspace is structured and how we use PARA, Zettelkasten, Eisenhower Matrix, Kanban, and custom dashboards to manage workflows, tasks, and knowledge.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 1. PARA Method

PARA is a foundational framework in our Notion setup that organises content into four main categories:

### P - Projects

- Active initiatives with a clear goal and deadline (e.g. "2025 Space Sustainability Talk", "CSR Framework Implementation").

- Tracked in a Projects Database with status, priority, and owners.

- Each project links to related Areas, Resources, and Archives.

### A - Areas

- Ongoing responsibilities without fixed end dates.

- Structured around core business functions:

- Each Area has an overview page, KPIs, and linked projects/tasks.

### R - Resources

- Knowledge and reference material (e.g. white papers, strategy docs, playbooks).

- Stored in a Resource Library database, tagged by topic.

### A - Archives

- Completed projects and outdated documents.

- Moved here for record-keeping and traceability.

Green Orbit Digital Notion Playbook

### 1. Introduction to Our Notion System

This playbook outlines how Green Orbit Digital uses Notion as a central operating system to manage all aspects of the business — from strategy to task execution. The system is designed for clarity, efficiency, and scalability.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 2. The PARA Method

Our Notion structure is built around the PARA framework (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives), designed to maximise organisation and clarity across the company.

### Projects

Projects are time-bound initiatives with clear outcomes.

- Examples:

- Structure: Each project has a dedicated Notion page including:

### Areas

Ongoing responsibilities and core functions of the business.

- Examples:

- Structure: Each Area has its own dashboard with:

### Resources

Reference materials, templates, research, and documentation used across projects and areas.

- Examples:

- Structure: Categorised databases with filters and tags (e.g., internal vs external; theme or topic).

### Archives

Inactive or completed items from Projects, Areas, and Resources.

- Examples:

- Structure: Automatically or manually moved to Archives with metadata intact for searchability.

PARA Use Cases at Green Orbit Digital:

- Keep strategy, execution, and knowledge clearly separated but connected.

- Align day-to-day tasks (Projects) with long-term sustainability and business goals (Areas).

- Reuse Resources across Projects without duplication.

- Maintain a lean, searchable archive that preserves institutional knowledge.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 3. Note Taking: Zettelkasten Method

We use the Zettelkasten system to capture and connect ideas, creating a living knowledge base.

- Permanent Notes: Standalone, atomic ideas tagged by theme or context.

- Literature Notes: Summaries of research, white papers, or meetings.

- Fleeting Notes: Quick thoughts captured in daily notes, later categorised or discarded.

- Connections: Each note links to relevant Projects, Areas, or Resources for contextual awareness.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 4. Task Management: Eisenhower Matrix + Kanban Hybrid

Tasks are managed in a hybrid Eisenhower Matrix and Kanban board format.

### Eisenhower Matrix Tags:

- Urgent & Important: Do now

- Not Urgent but Important: Schedule

- Urgent but Not Important: Delegate

- Not Urgent & Not Important: Eliminate or Archive

Tasks are filtered by Eisenhower priority and then moved through a Kanban board:

- Backlog

- This Week

- In Progress

- Awaiting Review

- Completed

Each task card includes:

- Priority label (Eisenhower Matrix)

- Due date and reminder

- Related Project or Area

- Notes or links to resources

- Owner/Assignee

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 5. Dashboards

We maintain interconnected Notion dashboards for visibility and decision-making.

### Company HQ Dashboard:

- Mission, Vision, and Strategy Links

- Key Projects (OKRs)

- Area Health Snapshots

- Weekly Review & Retrospective

### Personal Dashboards (per user):

- Assigned Tasks

- Notes & Inbox

- Eisenhower Filter View

- Quick Links to Active Projects

### Departmental Dashboards (Areas):

- Tailored to department needs

- Include SOPs, KPIs, reports, meetings, and related tasks

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 6. Best Practices

- Use templates for projects, meetings, and briefs.

- Weekly reviews: Tidy tasks, capture notes, archive closed projects.

- Link everything: Use backlinks and mentions to reduce redundancy.

- Keep it simple: Only show what's needed per dashboard.

- Documentation first: Always write up insights and SOPs.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

Let me know if you want this structured as a visual Notion workspace or turned into a public-facing knowledge centre using Guru or a similar platform.

I've expanded the PARA section and completed the Notion playbook with detailed examples, structures, and best practices. Let me know if you'd like a visual Notion workspace version, embed-ready components, or a version suitable for onboarding new team members or clients.

## 2. Note-Taking: Zettelkasten Method

We use the Zettelkasten system to capture, connect, and contextualise ideas.

### Structure:

- Each note (zettel) is atomic: one idea per note.

- Stored in a Zettelkasten Notes database with backlinks, tags, and linked context.

- Notes are categorised as:

This setup supports creativity, learning, and synthesis for content creation, thought leadership, and strategic development.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 3. Task Management

We use a hybrid system combining Kanban and Eisenhower Matrix:

### Eisenhower Matrix

- Tasks are first triaged by urgency and importance:

- Tasks are tagged accordingly in the Tasks Database.

### Kanban Board

- Tasks flow through a board with statuses:

Each task links to related Projects and Areas, with filters to view by Eisenhower category, status, and assignee.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 4. Dashboards

We use custom dashboards for different needs:

### Company HQ Dashboard

- Overview of all business areas

- KPIs, active projects, recent notes

- High-priority tasks by Eisenhower quadrant

- Quick links to tools and systems

### Departmental Dashboards (e.g. Marketing, Partnerships)

- Projects by area

- Weekly goals

- Campaign metrics

- Resource links

### Personal Dashboard

- My Tasks (filtered Kanban)

- Eisenhower Quadrant View

- Inbox for new notes & tasks

- Calendar view of deadlines

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 5. Templates & Automation

To support consistency, we use templates for:

- Project Briefs

- Meeting Notes

- SOPs

- Campaign Planning

- Weekly Reviews

Automations (via Notion buttons or third-party tools like Zapier/Make) streamline:

- New task creation from meeting notes

- Archiving completed projects

- Reminders for project check-ins

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 6. Best Practices

- Keep notes atomic and tagged

- Link related content across databases

- Weekly review every Friday (review tasks, projects, notes)

- Monthly PARA audit to reorganise content

- Maintain single source of truth—update databases, not static pages

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 7. Access and Permissions

- Role-based access (Admin, Editor, Viewer)

- Sensitive areas (Finance, HR) are restricted

- Shared templates and common areas remain accessible to all contributors

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

This scalable Notion setup ensures Green Orbit Digital stays focused, agile, and aligned—supporting high-impact work with clarity and purpose.

The complete Notion playbook has been added to your document, detailing the PARA structure, Zettelkasten method, Eisenhower Matrix, Kanban, dashboards, and best practices. Let me know if you want it visually designed, turned into a training module, or adapted into a client-facing template.

## Task Management

We combine the Eisenhower Matrix for prioritisation and Kanban boards for execution.

### Eisenhower Matrix

Located on the Today View:

- Urgent & Important: Do now

- Important, Not Urgent: Schedule

- Urgent, Not Important: Delegate

- Neither: Delete or defer

Tasks are added manually or from linked projects.

### Kanban Boards

Every project and area has its own Kanban setup, with standard columns:

- To Do

- In Progress

- Blocked

- Done

Tasks can be assigned, commented on, and tracked via filters (e.g. by owner or deadline).

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->
