Some fonts have parts of their name "reserved" per the [Reserved Font Name mechanism][SIL-RFN]:
> No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
> Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
> Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
> presented to the users.

- The main goals seem to be to: `Avoid collisions`, `Protect authors`, `Minimize support`, and `Encourage derivatives`

See the [Reserved Font Name section][SIL-RFN] for additional information
