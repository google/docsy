## People Group Dashboard Inventory

Several dashboards have been published to the People project in the Tableau environment. Below is a brief overview of some of the dashboards created and where you can find them:

### General project

These dashboards are safe for general use by the Tableau User population here at GitLab.

- [Attrition Dashboard](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/workbooks/2024177?:origin=card_share_link) - This dashboard gives turnover metrics for the organization. Rates can be filtered by `Rolling 12 Months`, `Fiscal Year to Date`,`Month to Date`, or `Quarter to Date` and different time periods can be selected. Dimensional breakouts of the data that result in small counts are hidden to protect Team Member identity.
- [DIB Identity Dashboard](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/workbooks/2188641?:origin=card_share_link) - This dashboard shows diversity metrics as a percentage compared to the same date in the prior year. This dashboard is used for handbook embedding on [this page](/handbook/company/culture/inclusion/identity-data/).
- [Discretionary Bonus Dashboard](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/workbooks/2177808?:origin=card_share_link)- This dashboard tracks discretionary bonuses over time showing bonus counts, bonus rates as a percentage of headcount, or bonus rates as a rolling 3 month average relative to headcount.
