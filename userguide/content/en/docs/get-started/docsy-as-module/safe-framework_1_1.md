The Green Orbit Digital SAFE Framework serves as a guide to ensuring that we share information responsibly while maintaining transparency and integrity, in line with our core values. This framework is designed to help us protect sensitive information, maintain accuracy, ensure financial data is safeguarded, and be mindful of the impact that information can have.

As with our values, this is a living framework and we will continue to refine it based on lessons learned and the evolution of our practices. By contributing to the process, we reinforce the importance of responsible transparency and safeguard the integrity of Green Orbit Digital.

If you have any questions, please reach out through the designated SAFE communication channel or the internal teams for further guidance. For sensitive inquiries, please do not include them in public channels but message the legal team directly.

### WHAT IS SAFE?

Sensitive:

This reminds us to avoid sharing information that could be classified as sensitive without explicit approval from the relevant internal stakeholders. Considerations include:

- Is the information confidential or not publicly available?

- Does it include team member data, customer or partner details, or any material nonpublic information?

If you're unsure, always seek approval from Green Orbit Digital’s legal team before disclosing such information.

Accurate:

Accuracy is paramount. Before sharing any information, ask:

- Is the data verifiable?

- Can it be backed up by references or solid data?

- Are you the responsible individual for this information, and have you received approval from the relevant parties to share it?

Always double-check your data and methodology before disclosure, and indicate when estimates are being shared or data is subject to change.

Financial:

Financial information must be protected. The Chief Financial Officer’s approval is required before any financial details are shared externally. Considerations for financial disclosures include:

- Are you sharing financial data or forecasts?

- Does the information pertain to performance metrics, margins, or financial results?

If in doubt, consult the CFO to ensure compliance with our financial disclosure practices.

Effect:

The potential effect of any shared information must be carefully considered. Ask yourself:

- How will the information impact the company and stakeholders?

- Could it have unintended consequences, either positive or negative?

Always assess the broader implications before sharing any information to ensure the right outcome for Green Orbit Digital.
