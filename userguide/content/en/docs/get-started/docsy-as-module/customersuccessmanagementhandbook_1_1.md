# Customer Success Management Handbook

The Customer Success Management team at GitLab is a part of the Customer Success department, acting as trusted advisors to our customers and helping them realize value faster.
## Customer Success Segments
## Mission Statement
Accelerate customer success by aligning passionate CSMs with customers to:
- Drive adoption aligned with business outcomes
- Enable customers in current and future GitLab use cases
- Expand ROI from GitLab
## What is a Customer Success Manager (CSM) at GitLab?
CSMs are accountable for customer adoption, measurable outcomes, customer satisfaction, and creating true customer advocacy. We create successful customers by enabling, training, and nurturing them throughout their journey. The following areas incorporate the remit of a CSM:
- **Customer Adoption -** Ensure the customer is working towards or adopting their desired use cases to maturity. Ensure the successful onboarding of all intended users. Identify areas of adoption risk and establish mitigating plays and programs.
- **Delivering Positive Business Outcomes -** Ensure customers are meeting and exceeding their desired business outcomes so that customers can quantify and support their investment.
- **Trusted Advisor -** Establish “trusted advisor” relationships with the management and technical teams on the customer side while working seamlessly with our account team to deliver a best-in-class customer experience.
- **Account Expansion -** Lead adoption expansion beyond the customer’s desired use cases and further customer return on investment (ROI). Partner with Sales to identify expansion opportunities and ensure we realize the expansion potential of a customer account.
- **Leading Business Reviews -** Review and celebrate progress towards, or achievement of, the customer’s desired business outcomes. Address challenges with a plan for mitigation, align on upcoming and future customer business objectives.

### Education and Enablement
In Customer Success Management, it is important to be continuously learning more about our product and related industry topics. The [education and enablement handbook page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/education-enablement/) provides a dashboard of aggregated resources that we encourage you to use to get up to speed.
## SFDC useful reports
### Tracking opportunities for your assigned Strategic Account Executive (SAEs)
To ensure that opportunities are listed with the correct Order Type, [this Salesforce report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004agfP) shows you all of the opportunities that have closed, or are soon to close, with your SAEs. Tracking Order Type is important since CSM team quota and compensation depend on this. Please reference the latest [Sales Compensation Plan](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/sales-comp-plan/) information to know what is counted.
Next steps for you:
1. Customize [this SFDC report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004agfP) where “Account Owner = your SAEs”; “CSM = You”
1. Save report
1. Subscribe to report when “Record Count Greater Than 0” and Frequency = Weekly (You’ll get a weekly email as a reminder to look at the report)
1. If you find an opp that is tagged incorrectly, chatter (@Sales-Support) in the opportunity and let them know there is a mistake ([example](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/csm/#csm-tools))
