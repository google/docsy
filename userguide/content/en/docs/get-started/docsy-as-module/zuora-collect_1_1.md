## Business Need

The business had identified the need to optimize the [cash collection process](/handbook/finance/accounting/finance-ops/billing-ops/#cash-collections) in order to reduce the Order to Cash cycle, thereby reducing our Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), increasing cash efficiency for the business and scaling for future growth since the current collections process was partly automated with automated dunning notices remitted in a cadence of 7, 20, and 30 days past due. From there, a manual collections process would begin.

The Billing team was spending an average 31.5 hours per month/per person on accounts receivable activities totaling 157.5 hours per month for the team:

- Average 2.5 Hours per week on Accounts Receivable Aging.
- Average 2.5 Hours per week on Cases.
- Average 2 Hours per week on Zendesk.

## Business Solution

Since Zuora was already an application from our Tech Stack and used across different teams and departments, the business decided to move forward with the implementation of the Zuora Collect module in order to support collection activities automation. The implementation would allow the Billing team to create a more organized Collections team by moving into a single use collection platform.

### What is Zuora Collect

[Zuora Collect](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CE_Collect/Get_Started_with_Collect/Overview_of_Zuora_Collect) is a complete solution for optimizing recurring collections in the Subscription Economy. As main benefits, it can track unpaid invoices and delinquent accounts, manage automated business processes and intelligent retry logic, and customize payment runs.

1. Login to your Zuora account (via Okta).
