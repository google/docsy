General Disaster Recovery Best Practices for Green Orbit Digital

Cloud-Based Redundancy: Ensure all critical data is replicated across multiple cloud providers (e.g., Proton Drive, Google Cloud) and physical storage to provide redundancy. This way, if one cloud service goes down, the data remains accessible from another provider.

Staff Communication Plan: Set up communication systems outside of business-critical channels. For example, a dedicated Slack channel or WhatsApp group can provide immediate communication if email services are disrupted.

Testing & Training: Regularly test recovery procedures for all systems, and run tabletop exercises with the team to ensure they are familiar with the steps to take in case of a disaster. Staff should also be trained on how to restore files, switch to backup services, and troubleshoot common issues.

Documented DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan): Maintain a detailed disaster recovery document that outlines every step, key contacts, recovery objectives, and alternate processes for all critical systems and services. This document should be reviewed regularly and updated as systems evolve.

Incident Reporting: Establish an incident reporting protocol to detect and resolve any potential disasters early. This includes monitoring for irregularities in system performance, data integrity, and security breaches.

By integrating these systems with the outlined disaster recovery practices, Green Orbit Digital can ensure that it is prepared for potential disruptions and that the business can recover with minimal downtime or data loss. This proactive approach supports business continuity while fostering trust among clients and stakeholders.
