Ticket processor changes are classified as ad-hoc. Once changes are merged into the default branch, they will be live.

These also usually involve changes to other components we manage.

This can mean changes can cause severe problems if you have not thoroughly tested them.

## Making changes

Making the changes would be done by modifying the files within the project. You should also do this in a way that creates a MR. Said MR should always be peer reviewed before merging (the MR should enforce this).
