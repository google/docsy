This is an informational page for the SKU mapping.

While we call them "SKUs", in the actual code what we are mapping is Product Rate Charges.

Due to the sheer number of them, we document the mapping via the [Product Rate Charge Name mapping google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bJEq_q3h2fM3E8xWxYoFgZLdryWi_Cn5WLtzGSjuUUI/edit?usp=sharing) (internal only).
