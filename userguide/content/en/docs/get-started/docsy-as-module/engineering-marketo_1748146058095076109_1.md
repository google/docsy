## Snippets

Snippets are reusable chunks of content used in Marketo emails, landing pages, and templates. They can include a variety of content types.

### Key Features

- Snippets can be used across multiple programs.
- Updates to snippets are automatically reflected everywhere the snippet is used.

### Best Practices

- Double-check changes before saving, as updates are automatically propagated.
- Document all changes for reference and version control.

## Templates

Templates provide the base layout and formatting for Marketo emails and landing pages.

### Key Features

- Templates define where elements, including snippets, can be inserted.
- Updates to templates do not automatically reflect in previously created pages.

### Best Practices

- Manually republish pages to reflect updates in templates.
- Be cautious when making changes that may impact the layout or appearance of your pages.
- Document all changes for reference and version control
