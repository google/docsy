## Functions

In order to achieve its purpose, the Committee will perform two functions.

1. *Identification and consideration of disclosure issues*
The members of the Committee will continue to follow the internal processes set forth in the disclosure controls and procedures documented by the company pertaining to the preparation of periodic reports required by the federal securities laws and the preparation of quarterly earnings releases. As part of this process, the Committee shall:
   - Review the company’s periodic reports, with a particular focus on “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” and the “Financial Statements and Footnotes to the Financial Statements”;
   - Review and discuss with the controller’s group whether the company’s periodic reports and earning releases provide a fair presentation of the company’s financial condition, results of operation and cash flows;
   - Assess the materiality of specific events, developments or risks to the company; and
   - Review financial reporting issues that are significant to the company and other material reporting matters where the person primarily responsible for such matters made significant judgments (either independently or in consultation with others).
1. *Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures*
Each quarter, the Committee shall review and evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s procedures for recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed by the company in its Exchange Act filings. As part of this review and evaluation, in connection with the preparation of the company’s annual report, the Committee will assess the effectiveness of the company’s internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.

The Internal Audit shall submit a written report documenting its quarterly conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures and annual assessment of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting to the company’s CEO and CFO. Such reports shall be submitted as soon as practicable after the respective reporting period.

## Meeting

The Committee shall meet at the discretion of the chair, but not less than once per quarter. This will coincide with public filings of GitLab Inc. Any of the chairs may call a meeting by providing a minimum of 24 hours advance notice of the time of the meeting to all Committee members.
