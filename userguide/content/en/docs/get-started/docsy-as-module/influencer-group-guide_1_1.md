### Purpose and Benefits of a DIB Influencer Group

Internal diversity groups are a valuable component of a company’s diversity, inclusion, and belonging strategy because they provide an inclusive and effective mechanism for managing and initiating diversity, inclusion, and belonging programs. Diversity councils/groups successfully integrate the company’s DIB programs with their operations, strategies, missions, and objectives. They provide platforms for assessing the effectiveness of the DIB program, introducing reform, and overseeing DIB. They also demonstrate the company's commitment to DIB.
