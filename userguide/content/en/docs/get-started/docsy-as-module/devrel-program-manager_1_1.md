The Developer Relations Program Management team supports communities that align with GitLab's [CREDIT values](/handbook/values/) by executing specific programs that help these communities grow and thrive. These programs include the [**GitLab for Education**](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/education/), [**GitLab for Open Source**](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/), and [**GitLab for Startups**](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/startups/) programs. Our mission is to help these communities experience GitLab's vision of a world where everyone can contribute.

The Developer Relations Programs Management team is the DRI for establishing program requirements and benefits. As each of these programs provides free, unlimited seats of GitLab Ultimate to qualifying applicants (in addition to other benefits), the Developer Relations Programs team also oversees the entitlement process. As part of this work, the team leads community outreach efforts, marketing activities, and other strategic engagements (which may include serving on foundation boards, building partnerships, creating enablement and marketing content, delivering public presentations and learning sessions, and sponsoring events). We continually strive to be thought leaders in each respective community.

Members of the Developer Relations Programs Management team serve as liaisons to their respective communities, tracking the ways those communities prefer using GitLab and translating that knowledge into insights that help GitLab create a better product. We do this by collaborating across organizational functions whenever possible. We work with Product and Engineering teams to ensure each communities’ needs are represented on the GitLab roadmap. We also work with Marketing to regularly showcase our members' success through case studies, blog posts, GitLab Commit presentations, videos, meetups, and live streams. In all that we do, we aim to create and sustain mutually beneficial relationships between members of our programs and GitLab.
