## Business Goals

A purchase and ordering system that is well-documented and easily understood by all stakeholders.
The system will be resilient, reliable, and observable from the ground up.
In addition to addressing our current use-cases, the system will easily accommodate the addition
of new purchasing workflows (like channel partners), metered billing, and project Horse.
Finally, this should all be achieved without sacrifices to the buyer experience. Touchpoints with
the product(s) should be even more seamless than they are today, especially if/as we begin surfacing
up-sell opportunities directly in the product.

## Definitions

### What is Purchasing?

At GitLab, "fulfillment" generally refers to the [Fulfillment Sub-department](/handbook/engineering/development/fulfillment/) of Engineering.

To avoid confusion, this Working Group uses "purchasing" as an all-encompassing term to describe
the end-to-end purchasing experience including (but not necessarily limited to) ordering, billing,
licensing, fulfillment, and all of our internal workflows
(like lead generation for Sales, and reporting for Finance).

Be aware if you see the term "fulfillment" used casually in the context of this Working Group,
it is likely referring to the entire "purchasing system", not the
[Fulfillment Sub-department](/handbook/engineering/development/fulfillment/) specifically.

### Infrastructure

Infrastructure team is committed to supporting Fulfillment in the migration of CustomersDot
from the legacy Azure VM to GCP by the end of 2022-01. See the discussion in [2021-11-30 Engineering Allocation Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_9P8QlvaFO-XFoZTKZQsLUpm1wA2Vyf_Y83-9lX9tg/edit)) for details.

This will help bring CustomersDot in line with the rest of our application stack in terms of how it is operated,
but the application will still need to be instrumented and alerting configured to address our current
lack of observability and insight into this app.
