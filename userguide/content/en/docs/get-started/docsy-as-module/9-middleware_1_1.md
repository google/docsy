### more types of middleware

4. **Error-handling middleware**
> ![IMPORTANT]
> Error-handling middleware always takes four arguments. You must provide four arguments to identify it as an error-handling middleware function. Even if you donâ€™t need to use the next object, you must specify it to maintain the signature. Otherwise, the next object will be interpreted as regular middleware and will fail to handle errors
```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack)
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!')
})
```
5. **Third-party middleware**
- Use third-party middleware to add functionality to Express apps.
