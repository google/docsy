The every so fun "we don't have a process for this" situation. These are going
to be done on a case by case basis, so there isn't anything specific we can say
here.

Some general advise would be:

- Discuss with the rest of the team to figure out the best solution
- Use a project template for the project's creation (whichever one is the
  closest match) to ensure the settings are close to what you need

Make sure to setup the [.gitlab folder and its contents](./gitlab_folder_setup)
for the project!

**NOTE** You probably need to update some form of our handbook for this new
project, so make sure that gets done!
