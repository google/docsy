The groups in the [Create stage](/handbook/product/categories/#create-stage) conduct asynchronous standups in the
[#g_create_standup](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/g_create_standup) channel 3 times a week, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

The goal is to support the members of these groups in connecting at a personal level,
not to check in on people's progress or replace any existing processes to communicate
status or ask for help, and the questions are written with that in mind:

1. What did you do outside of work since we last spoke?
1. What are you planning to do today?
1. Is anything blocking your progress or productivity?

For more background, see the [Async standup feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/issues/4) on the
[Create stage issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/issues).
