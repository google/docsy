## Why I'm at GitLab

It is not often that one has the opportunity to be part of a company that is at the heart of our global economy and shaping what the future of software looks like. Software is at the core of so much of our day to day experience. GitLab plays a strategic role in this eco-system by helping customers deliver better, more secure software faster. It is amazing to speak with our customers who are incredibly loyal to GitLab and passionate about the role that we play in building their businesses.
Few technology start-ups grow from an innovative idea to a publicly traded company. Even fewer can deliver our level of growth and increase profitability at this scale. This is a testament to the value we create and our leadership position in the market.
Fundamental to long-term shareholder value creation is company culture. In my experience teams that respect each other and communicate openly also collaborate well and innovate. I believe that is what we have at GitLab and it is unique.

## My Personal Values

1. **Trust** - Trust is foundational for any healthy relationship or team. It is built over time by delivering on our commitments. I tend to engage with people assuming good intent and that trust is inherent. It is critical to me that I surround myself with people I can trust, both personally and professionally.
1. **Integrity** - I want to wake up every morning being able to say that I am making good decisions for the right reasons. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the decisions are right or wrong, but that they align with my values.
1. **Ownership** - When I was young I told my Dad the plate broke. He put the pieces of the plate on the counter and asked me to watch the pieces until they broke again. The plate didn’t break, I broke the plate. Everyone wants to take ownership when things are going well, but we learn the most when we own things that aren’t.

## My Super Powers - how you can get the best from me

1. **Relationship Building** -  I am passionate about building long term relationships and maintaining them. In my professional life I have created a valuable external network of people I also consider to be friends. This is where I find my energy.
1. **Collaboration** -  I love working with teams across functions. There is so much to learn and the collective thinking of a group is so much more powerful than the individual. Collaboration also requires a mutual commitment to not only being your best, but to helping others be their best.

## My Weaknesses

1. **Impulsivity** - Ideas and brainstorming make me very excited. When that happens I can generate a lot of ideas and ask a lot of questions very quickly. This can lead me to either cutting someone off (I sometimes refer to this as “stomping” on someone) or derailing the conversation.
    - How to help me manage this: Let me know I am doing it. I am working on my self-awareness and really appreciate feedback. I want to be a collaborative team member.
1. **Zoom** - I find Zoom to be exhausting. I spend all day on Zoom, frequently engaged with the financial community where I need to bring my best even if I am not feeling it. I also do my most productive thinking away from the computer which requires some space in my schedule.
    - How to help me manage this: When you request a meeting please let Anita Mall know its level of urgency so she can schedule accordingly while at the same time keeping my Zoom time balanced.

## My Expectations of Everyone

1. **Put GitLab First** - When I started my career an executive taught me to tackle problems with the question “What is best for the company”. Over the years I have found that this question creates better alignment around objectives and reminds team members to put their self-interest to the side.
1. **Deliver Quality** - I expect attention to details. Things like spelling mistakes, typos, and miscalculations are a distraction. More than that, I believe quality is asking the question “Why?”. Why? is where the impactful discussions can be had and decisions made.

## My Role

1. I am the Vice President, Investor Relations of GitLab.
1. Our Investor Relations mission statement is **Attract and retain the highest quality, lowest turnover shareholder base**.
1. My role: Collaborate with the team to crisply articulate our business strategy, differentiation, and related financial performance. Consistently use this narrative in all Wall Street facing communications including earnings, external facing assets, and conversations. Create demand for our stock by retaining shareholders and targeting highly correlated prospective shareholders through strategic financial analyst and investor engagement.

## Communication Preferences

1. I keep my personal and professional phones separate. This has allowed me to be more present in my personal relationships and make space. If you have slacked me or emailed me and need a response and haven’t heard back, please text me. My texts go to my personal phone and I will respond quickly.
1. I like collaborating with Google docs. That being said, if an earnings announcement is impending the number of comments and alerts get overwhelming.  Please don’t be shy about pointing out something if I have missed it.
1. Please acknowledge me if I have reached out. That way I know that things are in progress.

## Expectations for leadership What I need from you What you will get from me

1. Communication. Working in a virtual environment eliminates the casual conversations in the hall. To balance this, please communicate frequently and intentionally.
1. Responsiveness. This will help us all keep on track.
1. Ask questions and poke at assumptions to drive to the best outcomes.
1. Be passionate about what you are doing and why.
1. Share what you know.
1. Help me understand how I can help and break down roadblocks.
