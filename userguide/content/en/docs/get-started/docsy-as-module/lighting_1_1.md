## GVM Lights

## Operation

GVM Panel lights should be operated in CCT mode only. In most cases, it will not be necessary to use any other features.

1. Unfold the light stand and place it where you desire your light to be. Secure by twisting the appropriate knob.
1. Place the light on top of the stand while it is in its lowest position and secure.
1. Power the light by pressing the power switch to the right.
1. Raise the light to desired hight and secure.
1. **Press the right knob** to cycle modes until the LED display shows **CCT** on the second line.
1. Use the left knob to adjust brightness.
1. Use the right knob to adjust the colour temperature (CCT). A lower value represents warm light, such as candlelight. A higher value represents cool light, such as sunlight. In almost every case, the desired colour temperature is 5000k or higher because it will compliment the natural light from your windows.
1. Ensure that each GVM light displays an identical CCT value.
