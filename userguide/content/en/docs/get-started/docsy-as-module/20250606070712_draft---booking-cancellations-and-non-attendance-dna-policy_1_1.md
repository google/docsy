## Waitlist Management

To efficiently manage event capacity and accommodate participants, Green Orbit Digital maintains a waitlist system for popular events.

- When events reach capacity, interested participants can join a waitlist through our online booking system

- Waitlisted participants will be automatically notified if spots become available due to cancellations

- Priority on waitlists is given on a first-come, first-served basis

## Payment and Deposit Policy

To secure event bookings and minimize last-minute cancellations, the following payment procedures apply:

- A deposit may be required at the time of booking to secure your spot

- The deposit amount will be deducted from the total event cost

- Full payment must be received before the event start date unless otherwise specified

## Communication Channels

Green Orbit Digital maintains clear communication channels for all event-related matters:

- Primary communication will be conducted via email and SMS

- Emergency contact numbers will be provided for urgent matters during events

- Technical support is available through our live chat system during business hours

## Introduction

This policy outlines the procedures and expectations for coaching, conferences, workshops, and other professional development events hosted or organised by Green Orbit Digital. The aim is to ensure efficient management, enhance participant experience, and maintain the highest standards of professional delivery.

## Booking and Attendance Procedures

### Event Registration:

- Participants can register for coaching sessions, conferences, and workshops through Green Orbit Digital’s website or via direct invitation.

- Registration is confirmed upon receipt of payment (where applicable) and completion of any required forms.

### Event Non-Attendance (DNA) Policy:

- If a participant is unable to attend an event, they must notify Green Orbit Digital at least 48 hours before the event to allow for rescheduling or refund requests.

- Failure to attend without prior notice will result in a "Did Not Attend" (DNA) being recorded, and a refund will not be issued.

- Participants who accumulate two DNAs may be restricted from future events.

## Event Management

### Cancellation by Participants:

- Cancellations must be made in writing at least 48 hours before the scheduled event to qualify for a full refund or rescheduling.

- Cancellations within 24-48 hours will be eligible for rescheduling but not a refund.

- Cancellations made less than 24 hours before the event will be considered a DNA.

### Cancellation by Green Orbit Digital:

- In case of unforeseen circumstances requiring the cancellation or rescheduling of an event, participants will be informed immediately.

- Green Orbit Digital will offer participants a choice between rescheduling or a full refund.

## Participant Requirements

### Pre-Event Preparation:

- Participants are expected to review any pre-event materials provided, ensuring they are familiar with the content to optimise the experience.

- Technical requirements (such as software downloads or login details for virtual events) must be completed prior to the event. Support is available through our contact centre.

### Identification:

- For in-person events, participants may be asked to provide identification to verify their registration.

### Technology for Virtual Events:

- Green Orbit Digital uses platforms like Zoom or Microsoft Teams for virtual events.

- Participants must ensure their internet connection and device are functioning properly before the event starts. Green Orbit Digital offers limited IT support through chat or phone before the event.

## Event Notifications

### Event Confirmation:

- Upon successful registration, participants will receive a confirmation email, including event details, venue or platform access information, and any pre-event instructions.

### Reminders:

- Participants will receive automated reminders via email and SMS 72 hours and 24 hours before the event, highlighting key details and requirements.

## Refunds and Rescheduling

### Refunds:

- Full refunds will be issued for cancellations made at least 48 hours before the event.

- Cancellations made less than 48 hours before the event are not eligible for refunds, except in exceptional circumstances (e.g., medical emergencies).

### Rescheduling:

- Participants may reschedule an event once without penalty, provided they notify Green Orbit Digital at least 24 hours in advance.

- Rescheduling requests made less than 24 hours before the event may not be accommodated.

## Event Conduct

### Professional Behaviour:

- All participants are expected to maintain professional behaviour during Green Orbit Digital events. Disruptive behaviour may result in removal from the event without refund and possible exclusion from future events.

### Confidentiality:

- Participants must respect the confidentiality of discussions, particularly during coaching sessions and workshops, and refrain from sharing sensitive information outside of the event context.

## Accessibility and Special Requirements

### Reasonable Adjustments:

- Green Orbit Digital is committed to providing accessible events. Participants requiring special accommodations (e.g., accessibility needs, alternative communication methods) must inform the event organiser at least 7 days before the event to ensure proper arrangements.

### Support for Participants:

- IT support is available for virtual event participants through our live chat or phone lines during business hours. For in-person events, logistical support will be available at the venue.

## Record Keeping and Data Protection

### Event Records:

- Green Orbit Digital will keep records of all events, including participant details and attendance, in compliance with data protection regulations.

- Participant data will be used only for the purposes of event management and communication.

## Key Considerations

- Privacy: All personal information collected will be handled in accordance with our privacy policy.

- Event Adjustments: Green Orbit Digital reserves the right to modify event content, schedule, or presenters to accommodate changes without affecting the overall quality.
