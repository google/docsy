##### SDR Discovery Questions

- I’ve been hearing from customers that they are spending way more time than they’d like configuring, fixing, or maintaining hacked-together (or homegrown) CI solutions. I’m curious if that’s something you can relate to or a problem you're facing? I’d love to talk about it and see if that’s something we can help with.
- Are you currently using CI automate builds and tests? Would you say you spend more time than you'd like on manual tasks and unplanned work?
- What are you using as your main CI orchestration tool? Is it running critical workloads in production?
  - Sub question/add on: I’ve also been having some really good conversations with customers that are in need of advice on how to start a discussion with their peers or managers around a potential change in how things are done today with CI. Is that something you’d be open to?
- How do you currently support CI internally? Do you find maintenance to be a sore spot or a time eater?
- Do you find yourself working late and on the weekends dealing with build breaking changes and/or unplanned work? This isn't abnormal and I'd love to schedule a brief introduction to chat about how we can help you be more efficient with your cycles at GitLab.
