Emerging Talent, defined as talent with 2 years or less experience in a given domain, will be a value add as GitLab scales.

This page will serve to provide additional information for hiring managers when we achieve a critical mass of intern and job grade 4 positions.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to **attract**, **acquire**, and **activate** talent to unlock their potential, connecting learning agility with employment opportunities.

This is anchored in the belief that building a balanced workforce will enable GitLab to scale effectively and inclusively, and that building a strong foundation today will greatly impact our future growth.
