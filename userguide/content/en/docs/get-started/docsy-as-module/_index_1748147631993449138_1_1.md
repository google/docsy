title: Laptop Donations

## Overview

Donating hardware/laptops will help people in disadvantaged areas and/or from underrepresented groups with their ability to learn about technology. Therefore GitLab offers the possibility to donate hardware devices to [vendors on a curated list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15g4v5coC_yLlVNTKUZMwATllZhxzqbxrtvwJsi8bjXE/edit#gid=0) after 3 years of use. This curated list has been a result of the [Upstream Diversity Working Group](/handbook/company/working-groups/upstream-diversity/).

The vendors on the list have been meeting the following criteria:

1. Their focus group should be people in disadvantaged areas and/or underrepresented groups
1. They should be non-profit
1. Their values have to align with GitLab's CREDIT values
1. They should pass a "negative-press" check (first 2 pages of Google)

If you, as a GitLab team member, would like to add a vendor aligned with the criteria, please comment in the [Vendor sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15g4v5coC_yLlVNTKUZMwATllZhxzqbxrtvwJsi8bjXE/edit#gid=0).

## Process

1. Follow the [laptop refresh](/handbook/security/corporate/services/laptops/refresh) guide to create an issue.

1. Indicate in the issue you want to donate your used laptop to a vendor on the curated list.

1. Indicate in the issue which option of logistics will be used: Local Drop off or Sending via courier.

1. For security reasons, ensure that you have completed the [laptop wipe](/handbook/security/corporate/services/laptops/guide/wipe) process before drop off or sending.

1. When you receive your new laptop, complete the donation.
