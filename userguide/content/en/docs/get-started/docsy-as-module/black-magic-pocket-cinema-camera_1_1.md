## Setting Your Image

 The following settings are best completed when the camera is placed where you intend to record and your subject is in frame, with any lighting or adjustments already in place. The settings can all be easily reached on the LCD Touch Screen. Revise these steps every time you move your camera or adjust your light.

### 1. Adjust Lens Zoom

1. Rotate the middle of the lens to zoom in or out as you frame your subject.

### 2. Adjust Focus

1. Using the LCD Touch Screen, touch the face of the subject to set the camera focus.

*Note: If the focus does not adjust, check that the auto focus switch, located on the lens, is set to ON.*

### 3. Adjust Shutter Angle

1. On the LCD Touch Screen, select **Shutter** near the top left of the screen.
1. Use the touch screen controls to select a shutter angle of **180**.
1. Check the LCD screen to see the camera image. If you see flickering light, which can be the case with fluorescent lights, slightly modifying this value up or down is the best way to compensate.

*Note: If your camera has been adjusted to display shutter speed instead, adjust the setting to **1/50**.*

### 4. Adjust Iris

 The f-stop adjusts how much light is allowed into the lens.

#### At your Desk

1. On the LCD Touch Screen, select **Iris* near the top left of the screen.
1. Select the **Auto Exposure** slider.
1. Select **Shutter + Iris**

#### Away from your Desk

1. On the LCD Touch Screen, select **Iris** near the top left of the screen.
1. Use the touch screen controls to select an iris of **4.0.**.

### 5. Adjust ISO

1. With your camera in place and pointed at your subject, look at the Histogram at the bottom left of the LCD Screen. It looks like a horizontal bar with rolling white data. The left represents the darkest parts of your image and the right represents the brightest.
1. On the LCD Touch Screen, select **ISO** near the top right of the screen.
1. Adjust the **ISO** while referring to the Histogram. The contents of the histogram will shift right or left. Lower ISO values result in a better image, but require more light.
1. Continue to adjust the **ISO** until the Histogram shows a decreasing slope on both ends, avoiding a vertical drop off.

### 6. Adjust White Balance

The White Balance settings removes color cast from your image and helps white appear purely, without other hues.

1. On the LCD Touch Screen, select **White Balance** in the top right corner of the screen.
1. The camera will display a number of presets, selecting one will change the color of your image.
1. If you are working with lights you can control, such as the GMV Panel lights, adjust the value at the bottom left to match the setting on the lights. In most cases this will be around 5000.
1. If you are working with lights you can't control, choose the preset that seems to give you the most authentic image.

### 7. Adjust Audio Levels

1. Connect headphones to the camera using the port located on the left side of the camera, towards the top.
2. Using the LCD Touch Screen, select the audio meters on the lower right side.
3. Use the headphones to listen for any unwelcome noise in your audio. Common examples are clicking jewelry or watches against a desk or table, fans and vents, kitchen appliances turning on, or outside traffic.
4. While your subject is speaking confidently, adjust the levels until they very gently enter the yellow portion of the meter. This will record at an appropriate level, while allowing room for futher noise should your subject laugh or exclaim something loudly.

## Recording with your Blackmagic

### To an SD Card

1. After following the steps above. Press the red button on the back or front of the camera to record.
1. Press the button again to end the recording.
1. With the camera turned off, remove the SD card and use a card reader to connect it to your computer.
1. The file will appear as a mounted disk, but ensure the file is transferred to your computer before returning the card to your camera.

### Reference Slides with Zoom when Recording for a Presentation

1. Connect your Blackmagic camera with an HDMI cable to your computer using the Elgato Capture Card. It is plug and play.
1. While using your Blackmagic Camera as a webcam, you can share your deck and record normally as you would during a Zoom presentation.
1. You may then **ALSO** record by pressing the red button on the Blackmagic camera itself.
1. When you are finished, end both recordings.
1. You may provide both the zoom recording, along with the high quality recording on your SD card, to the digital production team, if the content is to be submitted for editing. The production team will use the Zoom recording to track where the slide should appear when editing the presentation.

***Be sure to keep your eye fixed on the Blackmagic lens only, as that is where you will be looking in the final video. Refrain from looking at your slides or computer as much as possible.***

## Webcams

The operation of webcams is plug and play. Connect the webcam to your computer via USB and use the clamp to position the camera on your laptop or monitor. Logitech and Razr webcams include a thread that will allow you to attach it to a tripod, if necessary.

## Lighting

## Elgato Lights

Elgato lights are packaged with easy-to-follow directions on a cardboard sheet. Please do not throw these out.

### Setup Instructions

1. Attach clamp to mounting pole.
1. Attach Elgato light to the other end. This can be done vertically or horizontally depending on what suits your workspace.
1. Connect the Power Cable and plug it in.
1. Secure the power cable using supplied fasteners to keep the cable tidy and prevent snags.
1. Download and install the Elgato Control Center application on your laptop or phone.

## GVM Lights

### Operation

GVM Panel lights should be operated in CCT mode only. In most cases, it will not be necessary to use any other features.

1. Place the light on top of the stand while it is in its lowest position and secure.
1. Power the light by pressing the power switch to the right.
1. Raise the light to thhe desired height and secure.
1. **Press the right knob** to cycle modes until the LED display shows **CCT** on the second line.
1. Use the left knob to adjust brightness.
1. Use the right knob to adjust the color temperature (CCT). A lower value represents warm light, such as candlelight. A higher value represents cool light, such as sunlight. In almost every case, the desired color temperature is 5000k or higher because it will compliment the natural light from your windows.
1. Ensure that each GVM light displays an identical CCT value.

## Teleprompters

## GlideGear TMP100 Teleprompter

1. Attach the tripod to the bottom of the unit using one of the available mounting threads.
1. Using the thumb screws on both sides of the mirror, rotate the mirror forward to an angle of about 45 degrees.
