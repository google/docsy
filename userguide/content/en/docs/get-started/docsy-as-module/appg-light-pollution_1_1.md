Subject: Advancing National Recognition of Light Pollution as an Environmental Priority under the Environment Act 2021

Dear Members of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Dark Skies,

I am writing on behalf of Green Orbit Digital to express our full support for your continued efforts to protect the night sky and reduce light pollution in the United Kingdom. We commend the re-establishment of the APPG for Dark Skies and your commitment to highlighting the environmental, health, and cultural importance of natural darkness. We are especially encouraged by your cross-party collaboration and alignment with global initiatives such as DarkSky International.

As a signatory of the European Light Pollution Manifesto adopted during the Spanish Presidency of the European Council in 2023, we wish to formally raise the case for greater recognition of artificial light at night (ALAN) as an environmental pollutant at the UK level. This request aligns closely with the provisions and intent of the Environment Act 2021.

### Relevance to the Environment Act 2021

Section 44 of the Environment Act defines the natural environment as including “plants, wild animals and other living organisms,” their habitats, land, air, and water, as well as the natural systems and processes through which they interact. Artificial light at night demonstrably affects all of these components by disrupting ecological cycles, altering species behaviour, and degrading habitat quality.

The Act’s definition of an "environmental effect" encompasses short- or long-term, cumulative, local, regional, or national impacts — all characteristics of light pollution. The adverse effects of ALAN are well-documented in both UK and international literature and include:

- Fragmentation of habitats and interruption of nocturnal behaviour in over 70% of flora and fauna;

- Disorientation of pollinators and migratory species;

- Increased energy waste (over 38 TWh annually in the EU);

- Negative health effects in humans due to circadian disruption, linked to chronic illnesses;

- Significant reduction in the visibility of the night sky, affecting both scientific research and cultural heritage.

### Five Environmental Principles and Light Pollution

We respectfully call on the APPG to consider how the five environmental principles enshrined in the Environment Act apply to light pollution:

1. Integration Principle – Environmental protection should be integrated into policy-making. Light pollution should be included in planning, transport, and infrastructure policies.

1. Prevention Principle – Preventing pollution is more effective than remediation. Responsible lighting design and LED regulation can prevent irreversible ecosystem disruption.

1. Rectification at Source – Issues should be tackled at their origin. Smart lighting and shielding technologies allow for localised mitigation.

1. Polluter Pays Principle – Those who contribute to excessive lighting should fund the necessary mitigation efforts.

1. Sustainable Development – Light pollution challenges our ability to meet the needs of present and future generations by degrading ecosystems and human health. Addressing ALAN directly aligns with the UK’s duty to deliver environmental and social value together.

### Opportunities for the UK

Current technologies such as multispectral photometers, satellite-based sensors, and detailed lighting inventories are readily available. The EU has shown leadership by funding programmes like Stars4ALL, ACTION, Keep It Dark, and the Horizon 2023 initiative on light and noise pollution. The UK could follow suit by supporting:

- A national light pollution monitoring network;

- Local authority capacity building for light audits;

- A public lighting data standard and open access mapping;

- Expansion of UK Dark Sky Reserves and ecological corridors;

- Regulatory inclusion of light pollution in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).

We believe the APPG is uniquely positioned to bring these issues into sharper national focus and urge you to recommend that light pollution be explicitly recognised in the UK's environmental framework and planning system.

We would welcome the opportunity to share further insights and collaborate on the development of a national dark skies strategy, aligned with the goals of the Environment Act and the UK’s international environmental commitments.

Thank you for your leadership and dedication.

Yours sincerely,

Subject: Advancing National Recognition of Light Pollution as an Environmental Priority under the Environment Act 2021

Dear Members of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Dark Skies,

I am writing on behalf of Green Orbit Digital to express our full support for the work of the APPG for Dark Skies and to encourage formal recognition of light pollution as an environmental pollutant within UK law and policy. In line with the Environment Act 2021, we believe there is an urgent need for light pollution to be addressed as a cross-cutting environmental, health, and astronomical issue. We respectfully submit this letter to contribute to your deliberations.

### Scientific Context and Environmental Relevance

The body of peer-reviewed evidence on artificial light at night (ALAN) is unequivocal. Light pollution:

- Alters the behaviour and physiology of wildlife, including disruption of migration, foraging, and reproduction cycles. Over 70% of all species are nocturnal, and ALAN severely fragments ecological connectivity.

- Affects pollinators, such as moths, beetles and bees, reducing their abundance and plant-pollination rates.

- Interferes with predator-prey dynamics by artificially extending daylight hours, leading to increased vulnerability and displacement.

- Is linked to the decline of at least 51% of threatened species, according to studies on biodiversity under pressure.

- Impairs human circadian rhythms, with growing associations between ALAN and sleep disorders, depression, obesity, diabetes, and certain cancers.

- Contributes to climate change and resource inefficiency, with more than 99% of outdoor artificial light being misdirected or excessive, leading to wastage of over €6.3 billion and 38 TWh annually in the EU.

- Obstructs astronomical observation, diminishing scientific capability and access to natural heritage. The UK has lost up to 90% of its population’s view of the Milky Way.

### UK Legislative and Policy Opportunity under the Environment Act 2021

Section 44 of the Environment Act defines the natural environment to include plants, animals, habitats, air, land, and water, and the natural systems that connect them. Artificial light is a pervasive stressor that directly interferes with each of these domains.

The Environment Act defines an environmental effect as any change to the environment that is primary or secondary, short- or long-term, local or transboundary, and positive or negative. Light pollution exhibits all of these characteristics:

- Primary and secondary effects on biodiversity and human health;

- Cumulative and transboundary impact, spreading across jurisdictions and skies;

- Long-term degradation of natural darkness and its regenerative functions.

### Application of the Five Environmental Principles

The five statutory environmental principles under the Environment Act provide a robust foundation for incorporating light pollution:

1. Integration Principle – Light pollution should be embedded in planning, infrastructure, and transportation policies to ensure consistency with nature and climate objectives.

1. Prevention Principle – Preventing unnecessary light emissions through better design and regulation is cheaper and more effective than post-hoc mitigation.

1. Rectification at Source – Technology exists to control light precisely through shielding, dimming, and smart timing.

1. Polluter Pays Principle – Those who over-illuminate should bear the cost of reducing impact or retrofitting systems.

1. Sustainable Development – A dark night sky supports ecological integrity, cultural continuity, and public health.

### Emerging Tools and EU Leadership

Technological capacity to monitor light pollution is rapidly advancing. Available tools include:

- Multispectral photometers to measure spectral emissions accurately;

- On-orbit satellite data from the VIIRS-DNB and future missions proposed by ESA and EUSPA;

- Citizen science platforms (e.g. Globe at Night) enabling community-driven data collection;

- Lighting inventories and spectral audits, critical for policy enforcement.

The EU has taken substantial steps through initiatives such as:

- Stars4ALL, Pirineos la Nuit, ACTION, Starlight, Dynamic Light, Night Light, KID – Keep it Dark, and Darker Sky, as well as new funding under Horizon 2023’s “Impact of Light and Noise Pollution on Biodiversity” (2024–2028).

The UK has the opportunity to lead by developing a national light pollution monitoring framework and formally recognising ALAN in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process.

### Strategic Recommendations

We respectfully urge the APPG to consider:

- Encouraging DEFRA and DLUHC to include light pollution within environmental and planning policy;

- Advocating for a UK-wide monitoring system integrated with local authority lighting strategies;

- Supporting research on ALAN's impacts under UKRI and Natural England;

- Establishing guidelines for dark sky-compatible development in National Parks and AONBs;

- Exploring tax incentives for light pollution mitigation and retrofitting.

We would welcome the opportunity to support your work through dialogue, evidence-sharing, and stakeholder engagement. The time is right for national action that aligns the UK with global best practice while fulfilling its obligations under the Environment Act.

Thank you for your leadership on this critical issue.

Yours sincerely,

Subject: Advancing National Recognition of Light Pollution as an Environmental Priority under the Environment Act 2021

Dear Members of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Dark Skies,

I am writing on behalf of Green Orbit Digital to express our support for the APPG's leadership in protecting the UK's night skies and to formally advocate for the national recognition of artificial light at night (ALAN) as a pollutant. As a signatory to the European Light Pollution Manifesto and an organisation dedicated to sustainable innovation, we view this as a critical issue at the intersection of environmental, health, and astronomical policy.

Artificial lighting has brought transformative benefits to society — yet its unregulated spread is now known to pose substantial and growing risks. Scientific consensus shows that ALAN disrupts biodiversity, contributes to climate change, interferes with human health, and obscures one of humanity’s oldest cultural and scientific resources: the night sky.

### Environmental and Scientific Context

The body of evidence is clear:

- More than 70% of animal species are nocturnal, and ALAN severely disrupts their behaviours including migration, reproduction, and feeding.

- Pollinators, such as moths and beetles, suffer reduced activity in artificially lit areas, threatening food web dynamics.

- Over 51% of threatened species are negatively affected by light pollution.

- Human health is impacted via circadian disruption, linked to sleep disorders, depression, obesity, and some cancers.

- Astronomical visibility has declined steeply — in the UK, up to 90% of the population cannot see the Milky Way.

- Light pollution wastes over €6.3 billion and 38 TWh of energy annually across the EU. The UK is likely experiencing similar losses.

- Between 2012–2017, green light emissions in the EU rose by 11%, and blue light emissions by 24%, the latter being especially harmful to ecosystems and sleep regulation.

### Alignment with the Environment Act 2021

The Environment Act defines the natural environment broadly — including habitats, land, air, water, and the organisms and systems they comprise. ALAN impacts each of these components directly and cumulatively. The Act's definition of an "environmental effect" includes local or transboundary, short- or long-term, and positive or negative impacts — all applicable to light pollution.

The five environmental principles enshrined in the Act are especially relevant:

1. Integration Principle – Environmental protection must be embedded in all policymaking. Light pollution should be considered in planning, infrastructure, and transport.

1. Prevention Principle – Light pollution is easier to prevent than to reverse. Early design intervention can prevent ecological and health harms.

1. Rectification at Source – Modern lighting technologies enable precise control of direction, timing, and intensity.

1. Polluter Pays Principle – Over-illuminating entities should bear the cost of mitigating environmental harm.

1. Sustainable Development – Ensuring that future generations inherit a resilient natural world requires curbing unnecessary light emissions today.

### Available Technology and EU Best Practice

Scientific and monitoring capabilities are robust:

- Multispectral photometers, on-orbit sensors (e.g., VIIRS-DNB), and citizen science projects offer scalable data.

- Lighting inventories and spectral audits can inform local policy and public accountability.

The EU has led with multiple initiatives: Stars4ALL, Pirineos la Nuit, ACTION, Starlight, Dynamic Light, Night Light, KID – Keep it Dark, and Darker Sky, with new research emerging under the Horizon 2023 call on Light and Noise Pollution.

The UK can and should match this ambition by:

- Establishing a national light pollution monitoring and data-sharing network;

- Supporting local authorities in lighting audits and retrofits;

- Updating planning guidance to reflect light pollution’s cumulative impacts;

- Requiring Environmental Impact Assessments to consider light emissions;

- Protecting and expanding the UK’s Dark Sky Reserves and ecological corridors.

### Working with the APPG for National Action

Green Orbit Digital supports the APPG’s objectives to:

- Promote dark sky-friendly lighting and planning policies;

- Highlight the environmental and health value of natural darkness;

- Protect existing UK Dark Sky Reserves and identify new ones;

- Collaborate with international partners including DarkSky International.

We will continue advocating through the channels available to us and would welcome the opportunity to assist in shaping UK-wide guidance or contributing to evidence sessions. We believe this is an opportunity for the UK to lead globally — not only in preserving a valuable natural resource but in advancing wellbeing, ecological resilience, and energy responsibility.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and for your continued leadership.

Yours sincerely,

Ryan Laird
