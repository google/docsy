## Being a Product Manager at GitLab

Product Managers at GitLab have a unique opportunity to define the future of the
entire [DevOps lifecycle](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/). We
are working on a [single application](/handbook/product/single-application) that
allows developers to invent, create, and deploy modern applications.

We want to facilitate [Concurrent DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/concurrent-devops/) so that teams can work simultaneously instead of sequentially, unleashing collaboration across organizations.

We work in a very unique way at GitLab, where flexibility and independence meet
a high paced, pragmatic way of working. And everything we do is [in the open](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).

We are looking for talented product managers that are excited by the idea to
contribute to our vision. We know there are a million things we can and want to
implement in GitLab. Be the one making decisions. A review of the product management role levels can be found [here](/job-families/product/product-manager/#career-paths).
