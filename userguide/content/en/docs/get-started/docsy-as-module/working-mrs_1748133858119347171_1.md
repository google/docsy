Working merge requests is not too different than how you would normally use a merge request in GitLab.

The important things to remember are:

- Always get a thorough peer review. This _should_ be requried on the merge request (as it needs approval from someone who has not made a commit).
- During peer review, you can make suggestions. But _never_ commit them. Doing so makes you no longer able to approve the merge request (and thus now requires _another_ peer to review it).
