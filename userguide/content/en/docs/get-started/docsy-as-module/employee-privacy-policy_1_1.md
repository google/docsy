This Employee Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains what types of personal data we may collect about our employees and how it may be used.

While this Privacy Policy is intended to describe the broadest range of our data processing activities globally, those processing activities may be more limited in some jurisdictions based on the restrictions of their laws. For example, the laws of a country may limit the types of personal data we can collect or the manner in which we process that data. In those instances, we adjust our internal policies and practices to reflect the requirements of local law.

For personal data collected under this Privacy Policy, the controller will be GitLab and the GitLab affiliates by which you are employed. For, (i) specific security concerns around your data, (ii) in the event you feel that you have not received proper attention to your data request, or (iii) have any other data privacy concerns, please contact GitLab Privacy Team by emailing [dpo@gitlab.com](mailto:dpo@gitlab.com).

GitLab, Inc. is a global company with its headquarters in the U.S. This means that personal data may be used, processed, and transferred to the United States and other countries or territories and those countries or territories may not offer the same level of data protection as the country where you reside, including the European Economic Area.  However, GitLab will ensure that appropriate or suitable safeguards are in place to protect your personal data and that transfer of your personal data complies with applicable data protection laws. Where required by applicable data protection laws, GitLab has ensured that service providers (including other GitLab affiliates) sign standard contractual clauses as approved by the European Commission or other supervisory authority with jurisdiction over the relevant GitLab data exporter (which typically will be your employer).

*Who is collecting your personal data (who is the data controller)?*

The GitLab entity that is a party to your employment contract or contract for services or otherwise employs you will be the data controller of your personal data.  The following are the GitLab entities that act as controller:  GitLab, Inc., GitLab, LLC., GitLab BV, GitLab GK, GitLab GmbH, GitLab PTY Ltd, GitLab Canada Corp, GitLab IT BV, GitLab UK, Ltd., GitLab Ireland Ltd., GitLab Korea Limited, GitLab Singapore Pte Ltd., GitLab France S.A.S. and other GitLab subsidiaries throughout the globe (collectively "GitLab").

GitLab affiliates may act as processors on behalf of other GitLab affiliates and/ or controllers.  Furthermore, GitLab, its affiliates and subsidiaries participate in a group-wide IT system in order to harmonize GitLab’s IT infrastructure and its use (the “System”). The System also may hold data on all employees, workers, individual contractors and contingent workers ("Staff"). Insofar the System serves to improve and harmonize most of the human resources (“HR”) processes within GitLab. GitLab, Inc. in the U.S. is responsible for the System.

*Applicability of Other GitLab Privacy Policies*

The websites of GitLab (e.g., [about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/)) have separate privacy policies and terms of use that apply to their use. Additionally, some of our third party products and services may have separate privacy policies and terms of use that apply to their use. Any personal data collected in connection with your use of those websites or products and services are not subject to this Privacy Policy.  If you are unsure how or if this Privacy Policy applies to you, please contact our Data Privacy Officer.

*Third Party Services*

In some cases, you may provide personal data to third parties that GitLab works with or that provide services to GitLab.  This includes, those parties identified in the [Tech Stack Application YAML](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml) (“Third Parties”).

Apart from personal data relating to yourself, you may also provide us with personal data of related parties, notably your dependents and other family members, for purposes of your HR administration and management, including the administration of benefits and to contact your next-of-kin in an emergency.

*How is Data Collected?*

Generally, we collect personal data directly from you in circumstances where you provide personal data (during the onboarding process, for example). However, in some instances, the personal data we collect has been inferred about you based on other information you provide us, through your interactions with us, or from third parties. When we collect your personal data from third parties it is either because you have given us express consent to do so, your consent was implied by your actions (e.g., your use of a Third-Party employee service made available to you by us), or because you provided explicit consent to the Third-Party to provide the personal data to us.  Where permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may collect personal data about you without your knowledge or consent.

We reserve the right to monitor the use of our equipment, devices, computers, network, applications, software, and similar assets and resources for the safety and protection of employees and intellectual property. In the event such monitoring occurs, it may result in the collection of personal data about you.  If required by applicable law, we will notify you of such monitoring and obtain your consent.

*Legal Basis for processing*

Where applicable data protection laws require us to process your personal data on the basis of a specific lawful justification, we generally process your personal data under one of the following bases:

Compliance with a legal obligation to which GitLab is subject; Entering into at-will employment (for US only) or performance under an employment contract with GitLab;
For GitLab's legitimate interests being those purposes described in the section above headed "How We Process and Use Your Personal Information";
Your consent where required and a legitimate legal basis under applicable local laws.

We may on occasion process your personal data for the purpose of the legitimate interests of a Third-Party where this is not overridden by your interests.

*Processing of Special Categories of Personal Data*

“Special Categories of Personal Data” includes information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, sex life or sexual orientation, as well as genetic and biometric data.

From time to time you may provide us with information which constitutes Special Categories of Personal Data or information from which Special Categories of Personal Data may be deduced.  In such cases, where required by law, we will obtain your express written consent to our processing of Special Categories of Personal Data.  If separate consent is not required by local law, by providing this information to GitLab, you give your freely given, informed, explicit consent for us to process those Special Categories of Personal Data for the purposes set out in How We Process and Use Your Personal Data section above.

You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting GitLab's People Operations Group or the DPO. Where you have withdrawn consent but GitLab retains the personal data we will only continue to process that Special Category Personal Data where necessary for those purposes where we have another appropriate legal basis such as processing necessary to comply with legal obligations related to employment or social security. However, this may mean that we cannot (for example) administer certain benefits or contact your next-of-kin in an emergency or provide support to you above and beyond our legal obligations.  You give your knowledgeable, freely given, express consent to GitLab for GitLab to use, disclose and otherwise process any personal health information about you that is provided to GitLab by any of your personal health information custodians, for the purposes set out in the How We Process and Use Your Personal Information section above.

*Sharing Personal Data*

Your personal data may be shared, including to our affiliates, subsidiaries, and other third parties, as follows:

- Where you request us or provide your consent to us.
- In order to carry out the uses of personal data described above (see, How We Process and Use Your Personal Data).
When using or collaborating with third parties in the operation of our business, including in connection with providing many of the benefits and services we offer our employees (e.g., human resources information systems, financial investment service providers, insurance providers). When we share personal data with third parties we typically require that they only use or disclose such personal data in a manner consistent with the use and disclosure provisions of this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
- We may buy or sell businesses and other assets. In such transactions, employee data is generally one of the transferred business assets and we reserve the right to include your personal data as an asset in any such transfer. Also, in the event that we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, your personal data may be one of the transferred assets.
- Where required by law, by order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or government tribunal, which includes in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements or in response to legal process.
- If we determine it is necessary or desirable to comply with the law or to protect or defend our rights or property.

- To seek advice from our lawyers and other professional advisors.

*Access to Personal Data We Collect*

To the extent access is required by applicable law, you can request access to the personal data that we hold about you. There are two seperate processes to request access to personal data. The first is to requst a copy of your Personnel File by submitting a [Personnel File Request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvFak7IYv4Z92h-3xu4rZeahQd_trbXblJNKBsM1EoZhuJZg/viewform). You can review the types of personal data contained in a Personnel File [here](/handbook/legal/record-retention-policy/#team-member-personnel-file-retention-policy). If you want to review personal data beyond what is included in a Personnel File, please submit a Data Access Request [form](https://forms.gle/8LVd1jseHoxCD47o9). If you want to correct your personal data, you may do this through the self-serve capabilities within Workday.

When requesting access to your personal data, please note that we may request specific information from you to enable us to confirm your identity and right to access, as well as to search for and provide you with the personal data that we hold about you.

We reserve the right not to grant access to personal data that we hold about you if access is not required by applicable law. There are also instances where applicable law or regulatory requirements allow or require us to refuse to provide some or all of the personal data that we hold about you. In addition, the personal data may have been destroyed, erased or made anonymous. In the event that we cannot provide you with access to your personal data, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.

*Correction of Collected Personal Data*

We endeavor to ensure that personal data in our possession is accurate, current and complete. If an individual believes that the personal data about him or her is incorrect, incomplete or outdated, he or she may request the revision or correction of that data. We reserve the right not to change any personal data we consider to be accurate or if such correction is not required by applicable law.

*Retention of Collected Data*

Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may retain your personal data only for as long as we believe it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the personal data was collected (including, for the purpose of meeting any legal, accounting or other reporting requirements or obligations) and for IT archival purposes.

Personal data for data subjects in the European Union is by default erased by GitLab after termination of your employment, with the exception of certain types of personal data, which may be stored for an extended period of time due to administrative purposes, e.g. for payment of retirement income or for giving references to other employers, or where such personal data must be retained to comply with regulatory requirements.

You may request that we delete the personal data about you that we hold, provided that we reserve the right not to grant such request if we are not required to delete personal data under applicable law. There are instances where applicable law or regulatory requirements allow or require us to refuse to delete this personal data. In the event that we cannot delete your personal data, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.

To request deletion of your personal data, please submit your request via this [Deletion Request Form](https://forms.gle/nhiPE1XX4jC6krfq7).

*Resolving Concerns*

If you have questions or concerns regarding the handling of your personal data, please contact GitLab's People Operations Group or DPO. Alternatively, you may report concerns or complaints to the Legal Department.

You may also anonymously report violations of policy or law using our Third-Party managed Compliance & Fraud Prevention Hotline. You can access the Hotline by going to [Questions,Reporting, and Effect of Violations section of the Code of Ethics](https://ir.gitlab.com/static-files/7d8c7eb3-cb17-4d68-a607-1b7a1fa1c95d)

*Changes to Privacy Policy*

We may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting notice of such a change in the revision table below. The effective date of each version of this Privacy Policy is identified the revision table.

*Security of Collected Information*

We are committed to protecting the security of the personal data collected, and we take reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to help protect the data from unauthorized or inappropriate access or use.

**Additional Rights**

You may also have the following additional rights, subject to certain exceptions and limitations as specified in applicable law:

*Data portability*

Where we are relying upon your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party as the legal basis for processing, and that personal data is processed by automatic means, to the extent provided under applicable law, you have the right to receive all such personal data which you have provided to GitLab in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and also to require us to transmit it to another controller where this is technically feasible;

*Right to restriction of processing*

You have the right to restrict our processing of your personal data where:

- You contest the accuracy of the personal data until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy;
- Where the processing is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase the information;
- Where we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you require them for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or
- Where you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below) pending verification as to whether GitLab has compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.

To the extent required by applicable law, where personal data is subjected to restriction in this way we will only process it with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

*Right to withdraw consent*

Where we are relying upon your consent to process data, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time. You can do this by contacting GitLab's People Operations Group or DPO.

*Right to object to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds*

Where we are relying upon legitimate interest to process data, then you have the right to object to such processing, and we must stop such processing unless we can either demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or where we need to process the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Normally, where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in your country of residence, if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes this regulation.
