## Chapter 1: Understanding the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR)

At Green Orbit Digital, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of data protection and privacy. As a responsible data controller and processor, we must ensure that all personal data is handled in compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.

### 1.1 What is UK GDPR and Why It Matters

The UK GDPR is the framework that governs how we collect, store, use, and share personal data. It strengthens individuals' rights and imposes greater responsibilities on organisations like ours to manage personal information securely and lawfully.

This regulation applies to all personal data, whether held electronically (e.g. in cloud storage like Untitled, CRM systems like Untitled, or emails) or physically (e.g. printed client contracts or event sign-up forms).

Our obligations are not just legal — they are essential to maintaining the trust of our clients, partners, and collaborators, particularly given our focus on sustainability, transparency, and ethical innovation.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 1.2 What is Personal Data?

‘Personal data’ means any information that can identify a living person, either directly or indirectly. This includes:

- Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses

- Job titles, company affiliations, and social media handles

- IP addresses, device IDs, and online behaviour

- Special category data such as health information, political or philosophical beliefs, or ethnicity (only collected with clear justification and explicit consent)

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 1.3 Green Orbit Digital’s Role and Responsibility

As both a data controller (when we decide how and why to process personal data) and a data processor (when we act on behalf of clients), we must:

- Process data fairly, transparently, and lawfully

- Only use data for clearly defined purposes

- Minimise the amount of data collected and retained

- Keep data accurate and up to date

- Store and process data securely

- Respect individuals’ rights over their data

All staff, contractors, interns, and collaborators at Green Orbit Digital are required to adhere to these principles.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 1.4 Individuals’ Rights

Under the UK GDPR, individuals have the right to:

- Be informed about how their data is used

- Access the personal data we hold about them

- Request corrections or deletions

- Object to certain types of processing

- Request restriction or portability of their data

- Withdraw consent at any time (for consent-based processing)

- Not be subject to automated decision-making without human oversight

All data subject requests must be forwarded to our designated Data Protection Officer (DPO) at dpo@greenorbit.space.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 1.5 Transparency and Privacy Statements

Whenever we collect personal data — whether through web forms, event sign-ups, consultations, or email campaigns — we must provide a clear privacy notice that explains:

- What data is being collected

- Why it’s being collected and how it will be used

- The lawful basis for processing

- Who it will be shared with (if anyone)

- How long it will be retained

- How individuals can exercise their rights

This notice must be included in all data collection points and must be as prominent and legible as the rest of the content.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 1.6 Training and Awareness

Everyone at Green Orbit Digital who processes personal data must complete GDPR awareness training annually and confirm their understanding of this guide. Contractors, freelancers, and collaborators must agree to our data protection terms before access to any systems is granted.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Chapter 2: Your Personal Data Responsibilities

Protecting personal data is not just the job of one person or team at Green Orbit Digital — it’s a shared responsibility. Everyone who has access to personal information, whether staff, freelancers, interns, or collaborators, must handle it with care and in accordance with the UK GDPR.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 2.1 Core Principles

At Green Orbit Digital, you must:

- Only access personal data you need to do your work.

- Use it only for the specific purpose agreed with the individual.

- Keep it secure, whether in paper or electronic form.

- Never share it unless authorised and legally justified.

- Delete it securely once it’s no longer needed.

Personal data always belongs to the individual it refers to. They have the legal right to know how it’s being used and to request corrections, deletions, or access at any time.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 2.2 Leavers and Role Changes

If someone leaves the company or their role changes and they no longer require access to personal data:

- All records (digital and physical) containing personal data must be returned or securely deleted within 7 days.

- Access to platforms (e.g. HubSpot, Notion, Google Workspace) will be revoked immediately.

- Failure to return or delete data may be treated as a data breach and reported to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 2.3 Publishing and Consent

Never publish or distribute someone’s personal data (e.g. a name, photo, or quote) publicly unless:

- You have written consent for the specific use.

- The data is already publicly available in a professional context and the use is fair and proportionate.

If in doubt, consult the Data Protection Officer at privacy@greenorbit.digital.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 2.4 Confidentiality and Discretion

You must treat all personal data confidentially and ensure others do the same. This includes avoiding casual or unauthorised sharing of personal details via:

- Conversations

- Emails

- Messaging apps

- Screenshots or photos

Be especially cautious in co-working spaces, public areas, or shared screens during video calls.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 2.5 Emergencies and Safeguarding

Data protection laws do not prevent you from sharing information with emergency services if:

- A person’s life or safety is in immediate danger.

- The data is necessary to protect someone from serious harm.

Otherwise, all external data sharing requests — including from authorities or journalists — must be referred to the DPO.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 2.6 Storing Data Securely

Paper records must be stored:

- In a locked cabinet or drawer

- Out of sight from household members or visitors

- Transported securely and kept in your possession at all times

Untitled 



Digital records must be:

- Stored on password-protected and encrypted devices or cloud systems approved by Green Orbit Digital

- Not downloaded onto personal devices unless explicitly permitted

- Accessed only through secure, authorised channels (e.g. via VPN or company Google Workspace)

We recommend the use of 2FA (two-factor authentication) and password managers such as Bitwarden or 1Password.

Password Management Policy 

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 2.7 What to Do If Something Goes Wrong

A data breach includes any situation where personal data is:

- Lost or stolen

- Sent to the wrong person

- Accessed by someone unauthorised

- Accidentally deleted or altered

If you suspect a breach has occurred:

1. Report it immediately to dpo@greenorbit.space 

1. Include what happened, when, and what data was involved.

1. Do not attempt to resolve or cover up the incident yourself.

We are legally required to report certain breaches to the ICO within 72 hours.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Chapter 3: Email, Communications and Data Security

As a remote-first and digitally driven organisation, Green Orbit Digital relies heavily on email and online tools to operate. With that comes a responsibility to ensure all communications involving personal data are handled securely and respectfully.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 3.1 Using Email Safely and Legally

When handling personal data over email:

- Always use your official Green Orbit Digital email account. Do not use personal email accounts for work-related communications.

- Use BCC (Blind Carbon Copy) when emailing multiple people who are not part of the same organisation or team. This protects their email addresses from being shared without consent.

- Double-check recipients before sending any email, especially if it includes sensitive or confidential data.

- Avoid sending large amounts of personal data via email. Use secure cloud sharing (Untitled with restricted access) when needed, and ensure only authorised recipients have access.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 3.2 Consent and Marketing Emails

Under the UK GDPR, you must not email someone with marketing content (e.g. newsletters, campaign updates, product or service promotions) unless:

- They have explicitly opted in, or

- You are contacting an existing client about similar services under a lawful basis (e.g. soft opt-in), and they have not opted out.

Every marketing email must include:

- A clear explanation of why the recipient is receiving it

- An easy way to unsubscribe or update preferences

- Our standard privacy footer with a link to the Privacy Policy.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 3.3 Communications and Membership Data

When using data from tools like HubSpot, Notion, or event sign-ups:

- Ensure the data is no more than 28 days old

- Only use it for the purpose for which it was collected

- Delete the exported data immediately after use, unless there's a lawful basis to retain it longer

If someone updates their contact preferences, this must be reflected in all systems as soon as possible.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 3.4 Secure Storage of Written and Digital Communications

All records — including:

- Emails

- Direct messages

- Notes from calls or meetings

— that include personal data must be stored securely and in line with Green Orbit Digital’s Data Retention Policy (see also Chapter 6).

Do not:

- Forward emails containing personal data to third parties without legal basis or consent

- Store emails locally unless they are backed up and access-controlled

- Share email content unless it is necessary and authorised

### 3.5 Third-Party Communication Tools

If you're using messaging apps like Untitled Untitled:

- Avoid discussing or sharing sensitive personal data unless the tool is secured and approved for use

- Never send passwords, ID numbers, or payment details over unencrypted channels

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 3.6 Protecting Your Communications

You must:

- Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts

- Lock your device when away from your screen

- Avoid accessing work email or files on public/shared computers or unsecured Wi-Fi

- Report any suspicious emails (phishing, spoofing, etc.) to the DPO immediately

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 3.7 Practical Example: A Mistake to Avoid

Scenario: You email a list of workshop participants using the “To” field instead of “Bcc”.

Impact: Every recipient now sees each other's email address, violating their privacy.

Action: Report it to dpo@greenorbit.space immediately. We will assess whether the incident needs to be reported to the ICO and notify the affected individuals appropriately.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Chapter 4: Using Client and Membership Data Responsibly

Green Orbit Digital interacts with a range of stakeholders — including clients, collaborators, students, and supporters — whose data must be handled with purpose, care, and respect. This chapter outlines how to manage that information responsibly and in line with UK GDPR and ePrivacy regulations.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 4.1 Who Can Access Stakeholder Data?

Only individuals whose role requires access to client or membership data may handle it. These roles may include:

- Directors and project leads

- Account managers

- Marketing and communications staff

- CRM and data analysts

- Interns or contractors with explicit data handling duties (under contract)

All such individuals must have completed Staff Data Protection Training POlicy and Data Protection and Confidentiality Policy (agreement)

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 4.2 Accessing and Using CRM Data (e.g. HubSpot)

When using platforms like HubSpot to manage contacts:

- Only access the records needed for your task.

- Use data only for the purposes for which the contact opted in (e.g. sending them event updates if they registered for an event).

- Respect marketing consent preferences at all times — if someone unsubscribed, you must not re-subscribe them manually or use workarounds.

- Exported data (e.g. for reporting or email lists) must be securely stored, password-protected, and deleted when no longer needed.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 4.3 Keeping Data Current

To ensure we comply with data minimisation and accuracy principles:

- Never reuse old downloads of contact data — always pull fresh lists from your CRM or database.

- Remove outdated contact information or preferences immediately upon request.

- Never send bulk emails to contacts unless the list is no more than 28 days old and verified.

If someone requests an update to their data, you must apply it promptly across all systems where their record exists.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 4.4 Internal Use and Confidentiality

When internal collaboration requires access to stakeholder information:

- Share only what is necessary to complete the task.

- Use secure sharing tools (e.g. Google Drive with restricted access).

- Never forward contact information to external freelancers or agencies without a written agreement and DPO approval.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 4.5 Marketing and Events

Marketing emails, surveys, and event invitations are subject to data protection and GDPR:

- You may only contact individuals who have consented to be contacted or where there is a legitimate interest that does not override their rights.

- Every communication must provide a clear unsubscribe option.

- For event participation, clearly inform attendees how their data (e.g. name, dietary needs, photos) will be used and stored.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 4.6 Training and Responsibilities

Any team member who accesses stakeholder data must:

- Complete Data Protection for GDPR training annually.

- Be able to demonstrate how they apply data handling best practices in their role.

- Seek guidance from dpo@greenorbit.space if unsure about data use or compliance.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Chapter 5: Images, Stories, and Visual Content

At Green Orbit Digital, storytelling and visual communication are key to how we engage audiences — whether through campaigns, case studies, digital media, or live events. However, images and personal stories often contain identifiable information and are therefore subject to UK GDPR.

This chapter outlines how to collect, store, and use visual content and stories responsibly.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 5.1 When Consent is Required

Before publishing or sharing someone’s identifiable image or story — such as in a campaign, testimonial, social media post, or promotional material — you must:

- Obtain explicit written consent using Green Orbit Digital’s approved Image & Story Consent Form.

- Clearly explain:

Consent forms must be stored securely for at least one year after the final use of the image or story. Consent form - all media types 

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 5.2 When Consent Is Not Required

Consent is not required if:

- The image features crowds or public events where no individuals are the focus and faces are not clearly identifiable.

- The person is not recognisable, e.g. they appear in silhouette, are facing away, or are anonymised.

- You are using stock photography or visuals that are fully licensed and GDPR-safe (e.g. from Unsplash, Pexels, or our internal image bank).

Even in these cases, it is good practice to notify people when photography or filming is taking place, and offer them the chance to opt out or avoid the frame.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 5.3 Good Practice for Visual Content Collection

When gathering content:

- Let participants know in advance that photos or filming may take place.

- Display notices at events or online sessions explaining how visuals will be used.

- Provide clear opt-out options (e.g. a no-photo sticker at in-person events, or a “camera off” recommendation for online).

- Use model release or consent forms for anyone featured in close-ups or giving personal stories.

For minors or vulnerable adults, consent must be obtained from a parent, guardian, or legally authorised representative.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 5.4 Storage and Retention of Visual Content

- All visual content must be stored securely on Green Orbit Digital’s authorised platforms (e.g. Untitled, Untitled, or DAM systems) with access restricted to relevant team members.

- Do not store photos or stories on personal devices or external USB drives without encryption.

- Stories and photos must be deleted within three years of their last use.

- Consent forms must be retained for one year beyond the deletion date.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 5.5 Ethical Storytelling

When sharing case studies or testimonials:

- Avoid including unnecessary personal details (e.g. health, financial, or contact information).

- Use first names only unless explicit permission is granted to use full names.

- Give the subject an opportunity to review and approve the final version before publication.

- Be sensitive to cultural, emotional, or reputational risks that the person might face.

Ethical storytelling helps protect people’s dignity and reinforces trust in Green Orbit Digital as a responsible communicator.

## Chapter 6: Data Retention and Secure Deletion

To comply with UK GDPR principles — particularly data minimisation and storage limitation — Green Orbit Digital only retains personal data for as long as it is genuinely needed. Holding onto data longer than necessary increases the risk of misuse, breaches, and non-compliance.

This chapter sets out how long we should keep different types of personal data, and how to securely dispose of it when no longer needed.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 6.1 General Retention Principles

You must:

- Define the purpose for which data is being held

- Delete or anonymise personal data once it is no longer required

- Review data holdings regularly to ensure outdated information is removed

- Document any exceptions where longer retention is required (e.g. for legal or contractual obligations)

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 6.2 Data Retention Timelines

See Data Retention Policy 

Note: Data used for statistical or analytical purposes may be anonymised and retained longer.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 6.3 Secure Deletion Procedures

Paper records:

- Shred or use a confidential waste service.

- Do not dispose of documents in general recycling or bins.

Electronic files:

- Permanently delete files from your device or cloud storage.

- Empty your Recycle Bin or Trash folder.

- Where possible, use secure deletion tools or encryption wipe.

Cloud and third-party tools:

- Remove or anonymise records directly within platforms (e.g. HubSpot, Google Drive).

- Ensure backups do not retain unnecessary personal data longer than necessary.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 6.4 IT and Device Disposal

Before disposing of laptops, phones, USB drives, or other devices:

- Wipe all data using secure format tools.

- Log the disposal with the Operations or IT lead.

- If donating or repurposing a device, confirm that no personal data remains.

Secure Disposal of Equipment Policy 

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 6.5 Data Review and Audits

We conduct annual data audits across key systems to ensure compliance. Team leads must review data holdings within their area and confirm:

- What personal data is stored

- Why it’s needed

- Where and how it’s stored

- Whether it should now be deleted

Any concerns should be raised with the Data Protection Officer at dpo@greenorbit.space.

## Chapter 7: Sharing Data with Third Parties

There are times when Green Orbit Digital may need to share personal data with external partners — such as collaborators, service providers, technology vendors, or funding bodies. When this happens, we must ensure data is shared lawfully, securely, and transparently.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 7.1 When Data Sharing Is Permitted

You may only share personal data with a third party when:

- The individual has given explicit consent (e.g. for joint projects or referrals)

- There is a contractual obligation or legitimate interest, and this has been communicated in our Privacy Policy

- The sharing is necessary for legal reasons (e.g. fraud prevention, court orders)

- The third party is acting as a data processor on our behalf under a written agreement

If none of the above apply, do not share the data.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 7.2 Data Sharing Agreements

Before sharing personal data, we must have a formal agreement in place. This includes:

- Data Processing Agreement (DPA) — when a third party handles data on our behalf (e.g. a marketing agency, freelance CRM consultant, or virtual assistant)

- Confidentiality Undertaking — for contractors or short-term collaborators with temporary access to data

- Collaboration strategy and policy Collaboration Agreement — where data is shared between partners for a joint initiative

These documents must:

- Outline what data is shared, how it will be used, and for how long

- Require the third party to follow UK GDPR standards

- Specify security, retention, and breach reporting obligations

Templates can be requested from the DPO.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 7.3 Security Requirements for Third Parties

Third parties must demonstrate that they:

- Store data securely (e.g. encrypted storage, 2FA, secure platforms)

- Restrict access to authorised personnel only

- Notify us of any breach within 24 hours

- Delete or return data at the end of the contract or collaboration

We do not allow the use of unsecured tools (e.g. free Dropbox or unprotected USBs) for storing or transferring personal data.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 7.4 Cloud Services and International Transfers

If a third party uses cloud-based systems, they must:

- Store data in the UK or EEA, or

- Use providers with recognised adequacy decisions or Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)

This includes platforms like Proton, Untitled, Untitled, and Untitled — all of which meet our compliance criteria. If unsure, seek DPO approval before proceeding.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 7.5 Public and One-Off Sharing

If you’re booking a venue, arranging transport, or using one-off services (e.g. for catering or hospitality):

- Do not share personal data unless essential (e.g. dietary or access needs)

- Minimise the amount of information shared

- If in doubt, anonymise where possible or get individual consent

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 7.6 Monitoring and Accountability

Project leads are responsible for:

- Ensuring third parties follow the agreed terms

- Keeping a record of data sharing activities

- Escalating concerns or breaches to dpo@greenorbit.space 

A central log of data-sharing agreements is maintained by the DPO and reviewed annually.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Final Note

Handling data properly is part of what makes Green Orbit Digital a trusted and ethical brand. Our clients, supporters, and collaborators rely on us to protect their privacy and honour our values of transparency, accountability, and sustainability.

If you ever have questions, uncertainties, or concerns about handling data, don't guess — reach out to dpo@greenorbit.space for guidance.
