## Why This Matters

Properly tagging customer contacts is crucial for our personalized digital communication strategy. When we accurately identify contact roles, we can:

- Deliver targeted content that resonates with each persona
- Increase engagement with our digital programs
- Improve product adoption through relevant use case information
- Gather more meaningful feedback from the right stakeholders
- Create a better overall customer experience

Proper role tagging ensures our messages reach the right people at the right time. This allows us to scale our communication efforts efficiently while maintaining personalization.

## How to Tag Contacts

### In Salesforce

- Navigate to the contact record in Salesforce
- Locate the "Role" field in the contact details section
- Select the appropriate role(s) from the dropdown list
- Save the contact record
- Remember that contacts can have multiple roles assigned (for example, a contact can be both a GitLab Admin and Technical)

### In Gainsight

- Access the contact record in Gainsight
- Find the "GitLab Role" field in the contact details
- Select the appropriate role from the dropdown list
- Save your changes
- Multiple roles can be assigned in Gainsight as well

### Role Mapping for Digital Communications

Our digital programs target specific personas. Use [this mapping](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14udgDUoEhzMjkQMYBVmYInPUBHgpfSKm8vVDRTR3NyY/edit?usp=sharing) to ensure contacts receive the most relevant communications.

#### Considerations

- Other roles not managed by sales that receive digital engagement include SaaS owners, SaaS maintainers, and sold-to contacts.
- Webinars and newsletter can vary which may impact the persona group.

## Best Practices for Role Tagging

### When to Update Contact Roles

- During account onboarding
- When contact job titles or responsibilities change
- After customer calls where new role information is discovered
- During quarterly account reviews
- As part of annual data cleanup activities

### Ensuring Complete Role Data

- GitLab Admin requirement: Every account must have at least one GitLab Admin identified
- $500k + accounts, Achieve minimum of 3 contacts with appropriate role tags (Target: 90%+ of accounts)
- Leverage contact management reporting in Gainsight to identify gaps
- Ask about team structure during initial discovery calls

### Tips for Role Assignment

- When in doubt about technical vs. admin roles, check if the person manages the GitLab instance
- For contacts serving multiple functions, prioritize their primary role but tag secondary roles when relevant
- Leadership positions should be tagged as Team Lead/Manager even if they have technical backgrounds
- Security-focused roles should always receive the Security tag regardless of their formal title

### Communication Frequency

Our digital programs have different communication schedules to avoid overwhelming contacts. Please review the [FY26 - Digital Success Email Program Documentation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14udgDUoEhzMjkQMYBVmYInPUBHgpfSKm8vVDRTR3NyY/edit?usp=sharing) for details on program timing and content.

## Measuring Success

We track the following metrics to evaluate our contact tagging effectiveness:

- Percentage of contacts with defined roles (target: >85%)
- Number of accounts with at least one GitLab Admin (target: 100%)
- Email engagement rates by persona (open rate and click-through rate)
- CSAT survey completion rates

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What do I do if I'm unsure about a contact's role?

Check their LinkedIn profile or ask directly during your next interaction. When in doubt, consult with your manager or the Digital Success team.

### How can I verify I've completed all necessary tagging?

Utilize the Contact Management reporting in Gainsight to see any gaps in your assigned accounts.

### What if a contact has a role that doesn't fit the existing categories?

Use the closest match from the available roles. If truly unique, consult with your manager or the Digital Success team.

### How often should I review contact roles?

Quarterly reviews are recommended, with a full data cleanup annually.
