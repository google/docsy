Product Managers, Product Designers, and UX Researchers have access to the UX research tools below.  If you need access to any of these tools, please [open an access request](/handbook/business-technology/end-user-services/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/).

## Research tools we use

- [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) is used for scheduling research sessions with users. A basic plan (free) is usually adequate for Product Managers and Product Designers. UX Researchers are entitled to a Premium account. Should you wish to upgrade your Calendly account to Premium, please contact @asmolinski2.
- [Qualtrics: CoreXM with TextiQ](https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/core-xm/) is used for surveys and screening surveys. For further information about Qualtrics, including how to create and style your survey, please visit [Qualtrics tips & tricks](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/surveys/qualtrics/).
- [Dovetail](https://dovetailapp.com/) is used to analyze data, collaborate on insights, and as a research repository.
- [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/) is used to facilitate card sort testing and tree testing. We do not have an ongoing subscription, so a monthly license is purchased as needed. Contact @asmolinski2 if you need access.
- [UserTesting.com](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/unmoderated-testing/) is used for certain unmoderated testing for [solution validation](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/solution-validation-and-methods/) and [Category Maturity Scorecard studies](/handbook/product/ux/category-maturity/category-maturity-scorecards/). Note: UserTesting.com offers analysis tools but we prefer exporting the videos to Dovetail for analysis to keep a SSOT.
- [Respondent.io](https://www.respondent.io/) is used for moderated testing for [problem validation studies](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/problem-validation-and-methods/). We typically use Respondent.io to find participants if we're having challenges in finding participants within our own internal panel.
- [Figjam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) is used for online brainstorming, synthesis, and collaboration.
