### Introduction

Disciplinary procedures are established to address and resolve issues of misconduct or poor performance in the workplace. At Green Orbit Digital, we are committed to maintaining a fair and transparent disciplinary process that upholds our values and promotes a positive work environment for all employees.

### Purpose

The purpose of disciplinary procedures is to:

1. Address instances of misconduct or poor performance promptly and effectively.

1. Provide a framework for addressing disciplinary issues in a fair and consistent manner.

1. Support employees in understanding the expected standards of behavior and performance.

1. Ensure that disciplinary actions are proportionate to the severity of the offense and are applied consistently across the organization.

### Scope

These disciplinary procedures apply to all employees of Green Orbit Digital, including full-time, part-time, and temporary staff.

### Disciplinary Process

1. Informal Discussion: In minor cases of misconduct or performance issues, the employee's manager may initiate an informal discussion to address the issue. During this discussion, the manager will provide feedback to the employee and work together to identify solutions to improve performance or behavior.

1. Formal Investigation: If the issue is not resolved through informal discussion or if the misconduct is serious, a formal investigation will be conducted. The investigation may involve gathering evidence, interviewing witnesses, and reviewing relevant documentation. The employee will be informed of the investigation and will have the opportunity to present their side of the story.

1. Disciplinary Meeting: Following the investigation, if it is determined that disciplinary action is necessary, the employee will be invited to attend a disciplinary meeting. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the findings of the investigation, provide the employee with an opportunity to respond, and determine appropriate disciplinary action if warranted.

1. Disciplinary Action: Depending on the severity of the offense and the employee's history, disciplinary action may include verbal or written warnings, suspension, demotion, or termination of employment. The disciplinary action will be documented and communicated to the employee in writing.

1. Appeal Process: If the employee disagrees with the outcome of the disciplinary meeting, they have the right to appeal the decision. The appeal should be submitted in writing to the HR department within a specified timeframe. An independent panel will review the appeal and make a final decision.

### Confidentiality

All disciplinary matters will be handled with confidentiality to the extent possible. Information related to disciplinary actions will only be shared with individuals who have a legitimate need to know.

### Conclusion

At Green Orbit Digital, we believe in treating all employees fairly and respectfully, even in disciplinary situations. By following these disciplinary procedures, we aim to address misconduct and poor performance in a fair and consistent manner while upholding the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness.
