The core premise enabling the realization of Green Orbit’s vision is the acceleration of collective action within the space industry and beyond. Achieving our desired future will require focused efforts in several key areas, all aligned with our values of sustainability, innovation, collaboration, and systems change. Our path forward will require a deep commitment to shifting paradigms, fostering long-term engagement, and creating systemic changes that ensure a greener and more inclusive space sector.

1. Supporting Cultural Shifts Towards Sustainability and Equity

To drive meaningful change, we must guide societies, industries, and organizations toward adopting values rooted in sustainability, equity, and collective well-being. Green Orbit will encourage cultural shifts that move away from profit-driven, short-term gains and embrace long-term, sustainable practices. This shift will focus on:

- Advancing Equity: Moving power dynamics in favour of traditionally marginalized groups, ensuring that decision-making processes become more inclusive and collaborative.

- Fostering Collaboration Over Heroism: Cultivating an environment where collective action takes precedence over individual heroics, enabling more effective and broad-reaching solutions.

- Integrating Well-being and Spiritual Awareness: Encouraging holistic approaches that promote not just external success but also inner peace, resilience, and well-being for all involved.

2. Strengthening Political, Policy, and Community Engagement

Green Orbit will advocate for policies that not only support the space industry but also drive sustainability and social good. To achieve systemic change, we will work closely with governments, industry leaders, and grassroots organizations to align on shared sustainability goals. Key steps include:

- Advocacy for Supportive Policy: Lobbying for policies that incentivise sustainable practices within the space industry and across related sectors.

- Government Collaboration: Ensuring that space agencies and governments at all levels are not just passive participants but active enablers of social and environmental change.

- Community Engagement: Amplifying local voices and supporting grassroots movements that drive sustainability initiatives in space and Earth-focused projects.

3. Strengthening Systems-Level Funding and Support

Achieving sustainability goals requires more than just innovative ideas; it requires a rethinking of funding models that empower organizations to take risks and pursue long-term, systems-based solutions. Green Orbit will work with investors, philanthropists, and development agencies to support:

- Reforming Funding Structures: Pushing for funding models that favour collaboration, innovation, and impact over isolated projects.

- Creating Systems Change Funding Mechanisms: Encouraging funders to support multi-stakeholder efforts and to finance projects that address root causes rather than symptoms.

- Long-Term Financial Sustainability: Shaping financial frameworks that allow for continuous investment in green technologies, sustainable practices, and cross-sector partnerships.

4. Developing and Deploying Systems Change Tools

To facilitate collective action and long-term success, Green Orbit will focus on building and refining tools that measure, track, and enable systems-level change. By developing and promoting systems change frameworks, we will guide organizations in creating solutions that have lasting impact. This includes:

- Systems Thinking Integration: Encouraging a holistic view of problems, understanding interdependencies, and addressing the underlying causes of environmental and social challenges.

- Educational Resources and Training: Providing stakeholders with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand and apply systems thinking tools in their operations.

- Measuring Impact: Developing tools and metrics to track the effectiveness of our efforts in shifting systems toward sustainability, ensuring that progress is transparent and measurable.

5. Amplifying Impact Through Collaboration and Partnerships

Green Orbit will play a pivotal role in supporting collaboration among diverse stakeholders—ranging from space agencies and private companies to NGOs, policy-makers, and local communities. Building powerful partnerships across sectors is key to driving large-scale, systemic change. We will:

- Facilitate Cross-Sector Partnerships: Enable collaboration between industries, governments, and civil society to tackle global challenges such as climate change, space debris, and equitable access to space.

- Create Platforms for Knowledge Exchange: Support the creation of networks and forums that encourage knowledge sharing and collaborative problem-solving.

- Global Coalitions for Systems Change: Mobilize multi-sector coalitions to push forward ambitious initiatives aligned with the SDGs, particularly SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), to unlock joint action on sustainability challenges.

### Conclusion: Building the Future

Green Orbit’s pathway to realizing our desired future involves a multi-faceted approach that spans culture, policy, funding, systems thinking, and collaboration. By working towards these foundational areas, we will create a lasting legacy of positive change in the space industry—one that champions sustainability, equity, and systems transformation. Our actions today will shape the future of space, making it greener, more inclusive, and more aligned with the global community’s sustainability goals.
