title: Licensing and Renewals Support Pod
description: A Support Pod for everything Licensing and Renewals related (from the technical side). 
---

## Purpose

Discuss and handle Licensing, Renewal and Subscription related matters for customers that involve technical or technical-adjacent problems and solutions.

Provide training, help and assistance with others who wish to grow their knowledge in the Licensing, Renewal and Subscription field of GitLab technical support. This is done via shadowing, pairing, and other methods that will be evolved and developed as we transition from just a group of engineers working the tickets and improving the processes to a proper Support Pod.

## Current Objectives

- Collaborate on tickets
- Gain and share knowledge
- Improve documentation
- Idenify bugs, product issues and MRs
- Assist in updating relevant Support Training modules
- Serve as a resource for the greater Support team
- Influence product based on our experiences
- Develop tooling to aid in testing, troubleshooting, analysis, and learning
