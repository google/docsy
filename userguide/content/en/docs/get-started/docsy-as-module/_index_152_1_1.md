## About

We're the Design System team and we are part of the [Foundations Stage](/handbook/product/categories/#foundations-stage).

We hope it's a good entry point to learn more about who we are and what we do.

## What do we work on?

<!-- TODO: Pull this from the product side -->
- **Design System** ([Direction Page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/foundations/design_system/))

    We are currently focused on integrating our design system, [Pajamas](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com), into the GitLab product.

    We perform an accessibility audit on each component and make sure that our implementations in [GitLab UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) match the desired user experience, guidelines, and visual design.

    The Design System team does the preparation work necessary so that other Engineers at GitLab and members from the wider community can help out with these efforts.

## Communication

To get in touch with the Design System team, it's best to create an issue in the relevant project (typically [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab), [Pajamas](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com) or [GitLab UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui)) and add the `~"group::design system"` label, along with any other appropriate labels.
Then, ping the relevant Product Manager and/or Engineering Manager (see [team members](#team-members)).

For more urgent items or if you are unsure who to ask, ping `@gitlab-org/foundations/design-system` or use [#g_pajamas-design-system](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CDNNDD1T3) on Slack (internal only).

## How do we work?

In general, we use the standard GitLab [Product Development Flow](/handbook/product-development/product-development-flow/). Here are some specific workflows we use:

### Design Token Migration Strategy

### Phase 0 (Small Migration with validation screenshots)

- Create a small test migration issue to validate the approach for a particular scenario before applying it widely.
- This step is not mandatory, but is available as a safety net when we need extra confidence. It should be suggested when we are not confident enough in the mass migration.

### Phase 1 (Large-Scale, Low-Risk Migrations)

- Focus on straightforward, low-risk changes we've confirmed are safe. For example, simple like-for-like color class replacements or switching a component's variant that we've tested is risk-free.
- Do not dive into semantic correctness at this stage. The goal is to reduce deprecated classes quickly.
- If something looks unsafe or unclear:
  - Suggest removing it from the MR, or
  - Create (or suggest) an issue for a Phase 0 test migration that covers this specific case.
  - This phase is tackling thousands of changes without excessive review overhead. To aid with this, instead of changing one deprecated class across multiple directories, choose one directory and change all deprecated classes in that directory. This approach has a few benefits:
    - Reduces the chance of a merge conflict
    - Features are generally grouped by directory, this allows us to ping domain specific reviewers and more easily check features locally if there are questions.
    - If there are regressions, they are isolated to one feature instead of across the entire product

### Phase 2 (Page-by-Page Semantic Review)

- After handling the bulk of horizontal migrations, move on to detailed, page-by-page audits.
- Collaborate closely with teams and UX designers to ensure proper semantic usage and address code smells.
- This will be slower and more deliberate, but by then weâ€™ll have fewer issues to tackle since the big migrations are done.
