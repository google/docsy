We use weights to forecast the complexity of each given issue aimed at being scheduled into a given milestone. These weights help us ensure that the amount of scheduled work in a cycle is reasonable, both for the team as a whole and for each individual. The "weight budget" for a given cycle is determined based on the team's recent output, as well as the upcoming availability of each engineer.

Before each milestone, the Engineering Manager takes a pass and sets weights on all issues currently aimed at the next milestone by Product and triaging processes. On occasion, specific ICs can be brought to review the assigned weight. This is aimed at helping the ICs stay focused on Deliverables while working in the last week of the active milestone.

We understand weights are mere forecasts and we accept the uncertainty that comes with this.
