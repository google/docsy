Green Orbit Digital Notion Playbook

## Overview

Welcome to the Green Orbit Digital Playbook. This centralised guide outlines how we use Notion to run our sustainable marketing agency efficiently and effectively. It documents our structure, workflows, and methodologies to ensure consistency, scalability, and clarity across everything we do.

## PARA System for Organising Work

We structure everything using the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives). This approach helps us maintain clarity, reduce clutter, and retrieve information quickly.

### Projects

Active, short-term outcomes we are working toward (e.g. "Sustainable Events Campaign Q3"). These are time-bound and goal-oriented. Each project has:

- A dedicated page with goals, timelines, milestones

- Tasks linked via Notion database (Kanban or Table view)

- Links to relevant Resources and Areas

### Areas

Ongoing responsibilities we manage over time (e.g. "Finance", "Marketing", "HR"). These contain systems and SOPs for ongoing functions.
Examples:

- Marketing (campaign strategy, social media calendar)

- Operations (sustainability metrics, ISO processes)

- Finance (budget tracking, invoicing template)

### Resources

Non-actionable reference material (e.g. articles, research, reports, templates, inspiration, SOPs). We use tags and link these into Projects and Areas as needed.

### Archives

Completed or inactive items—past projects, sunset campaigns, outdated documents. We use an archive database to keep the workspace clean while maintaining access to historical knowledge.

## Note-Taking: Zettelkasten Method

We use a Zettelkasten-style approach to knowledge management:

- Notes are atomic and evergreen (one idea per note)

- Each note has a unique ID (e.g. ZK20250416-A)

- All notes are interlinked via backlinks and tags

- We differentiate between Literature Notes (summary of content) and Permanent Notes (ideas we develop and reuse)

We maintain a "Zettelkasten" database in Notion with views for:

- Literature notes (summarised research, reading)

- Permanent notes (conceptual thinking, development)

- Fleeting notes (temporary thoughts)

## Task Management: Eisenhower Matrix & Kanban

We manage tasks using a combination of:

### Eisenhower Matrix

Tasks are triaged into 4 quadrants:

1. Urgent + Important – Do immediately

1. Important but Not Urgent – Schedule

1. Urgent but Not Important – Delegate

1. Neither – Eliminate

We use a Notion database with a template that auto-sorts tasks by quadrant. This helps us prioritise work mindfully.

### Kanban Boards

Each project has a Kanban board with the following columns:

- Backlog

- Ready

- In Progress

- Waiting/Blocked

- Complete

We also use a team-wide board for weekly sprint planning.

## Dashboards

Our dashboards act as command centres for focus and visibility.

### Top-Level Company Dashboard

- Quick links to key projects and areas

- KPI widgets (OKRs, sustainability targets, revenue, carbon footprint)

- Team announcements, reminders, and quarterly focus

### Individual Dashboards

Each team member has a custom dashboard:

- Weekly to-dos

- Eisenhower matrix

- Personal calendar

- Quick capture inbox

### Onboarding Dashboard

- Welcome note

- Mission, values, and CSR commitments

- Key SOPs and policies

- First-week checklist

- Role-specific resources

## Integrations, Embeds & Other Notion Features

We enhance Notion's functionality by integrating it with the tools we already use.
