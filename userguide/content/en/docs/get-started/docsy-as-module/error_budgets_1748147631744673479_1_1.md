title: "Error Budgets"
---

We maintain the Error Budgets process that is described [in the Engineering Handbook](/handbook/engineering/error-budgets/).

Issues are kept in the [Observability group tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/observability/team/-/issues) with
the label of `Category::Error Budgets`.

We maintain the metrics used to generate the Error Budgets and we ensure that the reports are published on time. The reports are available as issues in the [Error Budget Reports issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/error-budget-reports/-/issue). They are automatically generated by the code in the same [project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/error-budget-reports) but require manual editing before sending them out.

We advocate for improving the SLOs for Stage Groups and we provide support to help them achieve this. Providing the Stage Groups
with data about how their feature categories operate on GitLab.com enables them to make good choices about how to efficiently
improve the reliability, availability and performance of their feature categories.
