### GitLab Customer Advisory Boards

**Purpose:** To help foster DevOps transformation and adoption we are establishing a Customer Advisory Board, where we focus on sharing DevOps best practices and lessons learned with each other. We believe that transparency and sharing  is a key way to help encourage the success of DevOps transformations.  The GitLab customer advisory board is intended to be home to learning and collaboration so we can all experience success through DevOps transformation.

**Members** Executives/Champions for DevOps within their organizations

**Frequency:**  We meet every quarter on the first Wednesday of the month at 11 a.m. Eastern for 2 hours

**Membership:** As of Feburary 2021, we have 30 customer members in the CAB.

**Meeting Recordings** Meetings are recorded for internal and member use. Members can seek these recordings by emailing CAB@gitlab.com

**Recurring Content** Our content plan for the CABs is determined by customer feedback on specific requests/topics as relayed via regular member surveys. We will frequently ask for GitLab Product Managers to join to [present the vision for their assigned DevOps stage](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/). Typical CAB's include customer breakout sessions, birds of a feather discussions and customer presentations, we aim for 80:20 customer driven conversations.  The CAB Manager will follow up CAB's with an email to members that includes a link to watch the recording and review meeting notes.

**Recorded CAB meetings** Due to the private nature of the Customer Advisory Board, video recordings and presentations are not linked here. If you are a GitLab employee, please join our internal CAB slack channel (#cab-shared-internal) or email CAB@gitlab.com.

### CAB Nomination Process

***Please reach out to the Product CAB Manager (slack the cab-internal channel) before you nominate a customer for the Product CAB. Typically the customer profile is enterprise level with over 1200 licenses; however we review every nomination on its own merit***

1. SAE's can nominate their customers for CAB membership via the customer contact view in SFDC (Nominate as a Reference tab).
