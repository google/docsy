They work together with product managers, designers, and [backend engineers](/job-families/engineering/backend-engineer/) to solve common goals.

## Responsibilities

- Develop features and improvements to the GitLab product in a secure, well-tested, and performant way
- Work with Product Management and other stakeholders (Backend, UX, etc.) to iterate on new features within the GitLab product.
- Craft code that meets our internal standards for style, maintainability, and best practices for a high-scale web environment. Maintain and advocate for these standards through code review.
- Consistently ship small features and improvements with minimal guidance and support from other team members. Collaborate with the team on larger projects.
- Help improve the overall experience of our product through improving the quality of the Frontend features both in your [group](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy) and features that benefit other groups.
