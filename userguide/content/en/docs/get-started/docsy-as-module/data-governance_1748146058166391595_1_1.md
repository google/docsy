At GitLab, maintaining data governance includes data definitions, policies, processes and procedures for our data. Compliance, transparency, quality are all drivers for data governance, and continue to be the focus of our team.

**Data Stewardship**

Data stewardship formalizes the accountability for managing the day-to-day procedures. As we implement a flexible data governance structure and aligning with [GitLab's mission](/handbook/company/mission/#mission) that everyone can contribute.
