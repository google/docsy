**Analytics Engineers** sit at the [intersection](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/#data-job-families) of business teams, [Data Analytics](/job-families/finance/data-analyst) and [Data Engineering](/job-families/finance/data-engineer) and are responsible for bringing robust, efficient, and integrated data models and products to life. Analytics Engineers speak the language of business teams and technical teams, they are able to translate data insights and analysis needs into models powered by the [Enterprise Data Platform](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform). The successful Analytics Engineer is able to blend business acumen with technical expertise and transition between business strategy and data development.

## Staff Analytics Engineer

The Staff Analytics Engineer reports to the [Manager, Data.](/job-families/finance/manager-data)

### Staff Analytics Engineer Job Grade

The Staff Analytics Engineer is a [grade 8](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#gitlab-job-grades).

**Market Justification:** From a survey data perspective 98 companies have this role with an average of 3 employee incumbents in all industries. In tech there are 33 companies reporting an average of 2 employee incumbents. The business justification for Analytics Engineer Staff and Principal job grades is to retain and develop deep technical talent by establishing Individual Contributor focused career paths for our team members who do not want to move into [Data People Management](/job-families/finance/manager-data/). Despite residing in the Finance Division, all Data job families are deeply technical in nature and require knowledge of databases, SQL, and modeling. Education in a technical field, typically Computer Science, Mathematics, Management Information Systems, or Data Analytics is typical for individuals in Data careers. At GitLab, the Analytics Engineer role is critical to support the growing Data Program because it helps glue together the business-facing Data Analyst roles with the technology-focused Data Engineering roles by creating data solutions for both roles. The Analytics Engineer is a specialized in dbt, which GitLab has chosen as the standard for developing Trusted Data Models.

### Staff Analytics Engineer Responsibilities

Responsibilities for the Staff Analytics Engineer extend the Senior Analytics Engineer job. In addition:

- Help promote data innovation across GitLab with a willingness to experiment and to confront hard and complex problems
- Identify and resolve impediments to efficiency and enable the entire Data Program to iterate faster

- Research new data engineering and analytics methodologies with minimal guidance and support from other team members
- Regularly participate in the Data Community/Industry outside of GitLab through writing, speaking, and/or networking
- Organize and Plan multi-quarter initiatives and develop the **Enterprise Model Roadmap**
- Help create a sense of psychological safety in the department

## Principal Analytics Engineer

The Principal Analytics Engineer reports to the [Manager, Data](/job-families/finance/manager-data) or [Director, Data & Analytics](/job-families/finance/data-and-insights-executive/#director-data-and-analytics).

### Principal Analytics Engineer Job Grade

The Principal Analytics Engineer is a [grade 9](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#gitlab-job-grades).

**Market Justification:** While there is limited supporting survey data for a grade 9, the same market justification for a Staff Analytics Engineer holds true for a Principal Analytics Engineer. In addition, Analytics Engineering is a relatively new job family in the Data space and is not as mature as the well-established Data Analysis, Data Engineering, and Data Scientist job families. Despite this, the Analytics Engineering job family is growing quickly and there are reasonable analysis to support the addition of new job grades:

- From a survey data perspective 11 companies have this role with an average of 1 employee incumbent in all industries.
- a LinkedIn search on 2021-08-16 identified 3 Principal Analytics Engineers within the tech sector.
- Companies which support the Analytics Engineer job family include: Netifly, Miro, Spotify, Netflix, Frame.io, Slalom, Pluralsight, and dbt.
