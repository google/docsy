Organisation:

scripts/: One-off or utility scripts (shell, Python, Node.js).

automation/: Workflow or CI/CD related tools (e.g., Hammerspoon configs, Raycast scripts).

utilities/: Larger reusable tools or CLI utilities.

Version Control: Could be git-initialised separately or integrated into personal repos depending on size and relevance.
