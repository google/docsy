description: "A list of managers and other assignees for scheduled GitLab release posts."

Each month a Product Manager will [lead the release post authorship](/handbook/marketing/blog#release-post-manager), and a Product Marketing Manager will [lead the messaging](/handbook/marketing/blog#pmm-lead). Other members will be responsible for the structural check, copy edit, and social media posts. For each monthly release, there are also technical [Release Managers](https://about.gitlab.com/community/release-managers/) who support the effort.
