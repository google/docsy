### Weeks 2 and 3

By now, everyone should be starting to settle in with working in Support Global Groups. We found in the trials this is a good time to have some conversations on how the group wants to coordinate, collaborate and self-organise.

#### Training/resources these 2 weeks

- Regional timezone sync meeting in each group once during weeks 2 and 3. There will be 1 meeting notes doc for each group, in which we will be taking notes during each meeting. This is to enable collaboration across the group's regions.
Everyone is highly encouraged to take part synchronously. We (DRIs) have seen the groups have some great conversations in the trials from which we felt all group members would benefit. It is, of course, also possible to collaborate asynchronously.
The DRI role is to facilitate any conversations that might be good for the group to have at the given point in time.
- Two "SGG Office Hours" events in each region in week 2
- DRIs will check in on all groups regularly and be available for questions
- DRIs continue to respond to your questions in `#spt_gg_questions`

### Weeks 4 and 5

#### Training and resources these 2 weeks

- Regional timezone sync meeting in each group 2 weeks after the previous sync meeting. We will continue using the group's meeting notes doc across all regions in the group.
- DRIs will check in on all groups regularly and be available for questions
- DRIs continue to respond to your questions in `#spt_gg_questions`

### Week 6 and going forward

Regional timezone sync meetings in each group will be held at intervals or as needed
