## OKRs

## Architecture review sync meeting

We want to use our Architecture Review meeting to invite other people from the [Fulfillment Section](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/fulfillment/). We aim to increase transparency, collaboration and knowledge sharing in the Fulfillment Section. Further we can use it as internal user research for the group.

### Meeting focus

- Upcoming projects that need cross-group collaboration (e.g. [CustomersDot BillingAccount can have multiple CustomersDot Users](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8951)).
- Intake and proposals to enable other Fulfillment groups to be more efficient.
- Architectural reviews and suggestions (e.g. spikes from other teams) that impact the CDot architecture.
- Topics related to our Zuora integration.
- Topics related to any [Fulfillment product category](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/data/categories.yml#L2219).

### Meeting routine and agenda

The weekly meeting can be seen on the [Fulfillment calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=gitlab.com_7199q584haas4tgeuk9qnd48nc@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/Madrid). Everyone is welcome to attend.

Every meeting has one or more discussion topics. To be inclusive and mindful of team members in all timezones, please consider the following:

- Topics should be added to the agenda well in advance, and at least one day before the meeting.
- Agenda with discussion topics will be shared in #s_fulfillment_fyi slack channel one day before the meeting.
- Topics can be reviewed async before the meeting, so questions and answers can be added to the agenda document.
- If there are no discussion topics in the agenda one day before the meeting, it will be canceled.

### Upcoming topics

Upcoming and past topics are documented in the [internal Architecture review meeting topics agenda doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_YbxNCo3KXK1-KdIZTgSvmU9kIslYjQnFZAmmu1DSqQ/edit#heading=h.jfvrioc0vg6).

### How to bring a topic to the meeting

We want everybody to contribute to the meeting. If you have a topic that you want to bring up in the Architecture Review meetings, add it to [this list of topics in the internal agenda doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_YbxNCo3KXK1-KdIZTgSvmU9kIslYjQnFZAmmu1DSqQ/edit#heading=h.jfvrioc0vg6) and we will schedule it.
