### What's New in GitLab üöÄ

The GitLab 13.7 release is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:

- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** 13.7 features multiple enhancements to package and dependency management, ensuring less development time goes to waste. This includes the added option to quickly find and view generic packages. It also includes multiple improvements to GitLab's Dependency Proxy ‚Äì the ability to avoid Docker rate-limits and speed up pipelines with the Dependency Proxy, use the Dependency Proxy with private projects and use pre-defined variables with the Dependency Proxy instead of relying on defined variables or hard-coding values in the gitlab.ci-yml file.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** Enhanced cross-collaboration means customers spend less time managing projects and more time developing valuable features. New project management features in 13.7 make it easier to efficiently collaborate across groups and projects, including the addition of merge request reviewers, which allows customers to quickly find out who's involved in the merge request or request a formal review that will send them a notification. This also includes the ability to clone issues with quick actions and sort issues by blockers to uncover which issues are blocking progress for other issues.
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** Get value into customers‚Äô hands sooner and more frequently with improved automation and deployment flexibility, including a new feature to automatically revert an unsuccessful deployment back to the last successful deployment and send an automatic status notification, and the ability to view deployment status in the Environment page. 13.7 also features the first officially supported beta of GitLab Runner container on Red Hat OpenShift and the Certified Runner Operator to give customers even more flexibility over how they release with GitLab.

![Ricardo-Amarilla-TMS-Thumb](/handbook/sales/field-communications/field-flash-newsletter/images/Ricardo_Amarilla_TMS_Thumb.png)

**Where did you grow up, and where are you based now?**

I was born and raised in Asunci√≥n-Paraguay, where I am also based. I have never lived abroad.

**What is your favorite thing about your job?**

The freedom I have in choosing the best time to do my job is something I have never experienced before. GitLab enables me to find the right balance between family, friends, and work.

**Which of GitLab's Values resonates most with you?**

Collaboration ‚Äì at GitLab, everyone is willing to help and collaborate, which is unique. Even though we are all-remote, I never feel disconnected thanks to this level of collaboration.

**Do you have a helpful tip for working at GitLab to share?**

Our customers usually have Technical Communities in MeetUp, LinkedIn, or other platforms. I would recommend participating in some of them for networking purposes. Besides learning new things, it has also helped me re-engage with some accounts.

**What is a hobby or skill you have that the team might not know about?**

I started playing paddle a few weeks ago; this is a new hobby for me. Besides this, I spend my spare time with my family, running, and riding my bike.

**Icebreaker: What's the craziest thing on your bucket list?**

Participate in an Ironman Triathlon.
