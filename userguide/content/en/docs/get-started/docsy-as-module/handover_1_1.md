### Sales Assisted FO to Expand AE

When a customer purchases GitLab with the assistance of a First Order Account Executive, it’s important to give that customer a seamless experience from the initial purchase to the implementation phase. Expecting a customer to have to repeat things they just shared with the First Order AE will lead to frustration and lack of confidence in GitLab’s ability to support them. Alternatively, if a customer feels like everyone is collaborating to deliver an excellent experience, they will be more likely to meet when asked, knowing that value will come from the experience.

The FO AE should look to contact the customer and perform the hand-off to the Expand AE within 24 hours of their purchase

By using the below template, they can thank the new customer for their purchase, provide some key resources, and introduce the Expand AE who will manage their account moving forward. (Note that this template is also available within Outreach).

Before sending the welcome email, be sure to consult the Rules of Engagement, to make sure you are looping in the correct AE.

#### SaaS Only

Once the FO AE has handed over the account via email, they are some keys steps they must now complete;

- Add the tag #FOtoFYEhandoff to the AE Comments section on the Account record.  (One can then use this [report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008mcf5) to help track which Accounts still need to be handed over).
- Make sure all the R7 components are completed on the FO closed won opportunity, plus all notes and call recordings are attached.
- Chatter the following people on the Account;
- Expand AE
- Expand AE’s ASM
- First Order ASM
- Sales Support
- Expand Director
- Once the above is done, the account and renewal opportunity will be transferred to the Expand AE and the hand over is considered complete!

#### Web Direct FO to Expand

These customers have made it to a GitLab paid plan without ever speaking to someone in sales, so we should be completing discovery as a first step to understand what brought the customer here. Typically, customers have a preconceived notion of what GitLab does and aren’t aware of all of the great features included in what they just paid for. It’s important to share that with them at this stage to ensure they get off to a successful start.

In this scenario an Expand AE should leverage the FYE Web Direct [report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008Qg6r) so they can reach out to new customers to introduce themselves, and schedule time to discuss success planning.

#### Assisted FO & Web Direct to Pooled

All Pooled accounts go through a specific low touch digital journey, and will only speak to an AE when they ‘hand raise’, or we have identified that they required sales assistance.  Further info on this model can be found [here](/handbook/sales/commercial/pooled_model/).

Upon entering this Low Touch digital journey, customers will be welcomed to the Pool via the below [email](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/customer-success-operations/-/issues/1918).
