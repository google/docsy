title: Locking Laptop When Unattended
---

## Overview

All GitLab team members must follow the **clean desk / clear screen** principle and keep their computers locked when not actively being used and any sensitive GitLab information must be stored and secured when not in use when working from a shared or public space.

In other words...

- Never leave your unlocked computer unattended.
- Activate the screensaver, lock the desktop, or close the lid.
- When possible, sign out or close active web browser sessions when finished.
- If using public [wireless networks](/handbook/security/corporate/services/laptops/security/networks), you should disable WiFi on your laptop when not in use or when traveling to avoid network traffic interception or use Nordlayer VPN.

## Screen Saver and Password Lock

> **No Action Required:** This has been automatically configured by [Jamf](/handbook/security/corporate/systems/jamf), however verification is recommended.

- Set up a screen saver with password lock on your laptop with a timeout of 15 minutes (or less).
- Require password after screen saver starts after 5 seconds (or less).
- Disable password hints
- Configure login window to show a list of users and not the last signed in user
