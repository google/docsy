title: Data Platform Security

description: >
   Data platform security involves implementing measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data within our platform. This encompasses a range of strategies and technologies aimed at safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorised access, data breaches, and other security threats. These measures often include access controls, encryption, authentication mechanisms, monitoring tools, and compliance frameworks to ensure that data remains secure throughout its lifecycle within the platform. By prioritising data platform security, we can mitigate risks, maintain regulatory compliance and build trust with our stakeholders.
