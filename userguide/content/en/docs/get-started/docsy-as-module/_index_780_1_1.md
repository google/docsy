## Summary

GitLab CI/CD, [integrated into GitLab in 2015](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2015/09/22/gitlab-8-0-released/),
is a [crucial](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/09/27/gitlab-leader-continuous-integration-forrester-wave/)
yet resource-intensive component that has experienced exponential growth, surpassing 1 billion builds by 2021.

Despite its evolution, the CI/CD data storage architecture remains largely unchanged since 2012,
posing scalability challenges due to the vast volume of data stored in PostgreSQL.

The proposed strategies involves:

1. [Partitioning CI/CD data tables](pipeline_partitioning.md) to efficiently support large scale
   of data and reduce the risk of databae performance degradation.
1. [Reducing the growth rate of metadata](reduce_data_growth_rate.md) by being efficient in the
   data to store at any given stage of the pipeline lifecycle.
1. [Archiving pipeline data](pipeline_archival.md) to consistently move less accessed data to other
   storage solutions like object storage and enforce a different access pattern.
1. [Introducing configurable data retention policies](retention_policies.md).

This architectural overhaul aims to enhance reliability, scalability, and performance while maintaining
data accessibility and compliance.

## Goals

This architectural overhaul aims to enhance reliability, scalability, and performance while maintaining
data accessibility and compliance.

## Challenges

There are more than two billion rows describing CI/CD builds in GitLab.com's
database. This data represents a sizable portion of the whole data stored in
PostgreSQL database running on GitLab.com.

This volume contributes to significant performance problems, development
challenges and is often related to production incidents.

We also expect a [significant growth in the number of builds executed on GitLab.com](../ci_scale/)
in the upcoming years.

## Opportunity

CI/CD data is subject to
[time-decay](../../../../company/working-groups/database-scalability/time-decay/)
because, usually, pipelines that are a few months old are not frequently
accessed or are even not relevant anymore. Restricting access to processing
pipelines that are older than a few months might help us to move this data out
of the primary database, to a different storage, that is more performant and
cost effective.

It is already possible to prevent processing builds
[that have been archived](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/continuous_integration.html#archive-jobs#archive-jobs).
When a build gets archived it will not be possible to retry it, but we still do
keep all the processing metadata in the database, and it consumes resources
that are scarce in the primary database.

To improve performance and make it easier to scale CI/CD data storage
we might want to follow these three tracks described below.

![pipeline data time decay](/images/engineering/architecture/design-documents/ci_data_decay/pipeline_data_time_decay.png)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

1. Partition CI/CD builds queuing database tables
2. Partition CI/CD pipelines database tables
3. Reduce the rate of builds metadata table growth

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD029 -->

## Principles

All the three tracks we will use to implement CI/CD time decay pattern are
associated with some challenges. As we progress with the implementation we will
need to solve many problems and devise many implementation details to make this
successful.

Below, we documented a few foundational principles to make it easier for
everyone to understand the vision described in this architectural blueprint.

### Removing pipeline data

While it might be tempting to remove old or archived data from our
databases this should be avoided. It is usually not desired to permanently
remove user data unless consent is given to do so. We can, however, move data
to a different data store, like object storage.

Archived data can still be needed sometimes (for example for compliance or
auditing reasons). We want to be able to retrieve this data if needed, as long
as permanent removal has not been requested or approved by a user.

### Accessing pipeline data in the UI

Implementing CI/CD data time-decay through partitioning might be challenging
when we still want to make it possible for users to access data stored in many
partitions.

We want to retain simplicity of accessing pipeline data in the UI. It will
require some backstage changes in how we reference pipeline data from other
resources, but we don't want to make it more difficult for users to find their
pipelines in the UI.

We may need to add "Archived" tab on the pipelines / builds list pages, but we
should be able to avoid additional steps / clicks when someone wants to view
pipeline status or builds associated with a merge request or a deployment.

We also may need to disable search in the "Archived" tab on pipelines / builds
list pages.

### Accessing pipeline data through the API

We accept the possible necessity of building a separate API endpoint /
endpoints needed to access pipeline data through the API.

In the new API users might need to provide a time range in which the data has
been created to search through their pipelines / builds. To make it
efficient it might be necessary to restrict access to querying data residing in
more than two partitions at once. We can do that by supporting time ranges
spanning the duration that equals to the builds archival policy.

It is possible to still allow users to use the old API to access archived
pipelines data, although a user provided partition identifier may be required.

### Other strategies considered

#### Partition CI/CD builds queuing database tables

While working on the [CI/CD Scale](../ci_scale/) blueprint, we have
introduced a [new architecture for queuing CI/CD builds](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5909#note_680407908)
for execution.

This allowed us to significantly improve performance. We still consider the new
solution as an intermediate mechanism, needed before we start working on the
next iteration. The following iteration that should improve the architecture of
builds queuing even more (it might require moving off the PostgreSQL fully or
partially).

In the meantime we want to ship another iteration, an intermediate step towards
more flexible and reliable solution. We want to partition the new queuing
tables, to reduce the impact on the database, to improve reliability and
database health.

Partitioning of CI/CD queuing tables does not need to follow the policy defined
for builds archival. Instead we should leverage a long-standing policy saying
that builds created more 24 hours ago need to be removed from the queue. This
business rule is present in the product since the inception of GitLab CI.

Epic: [Partition CI/CD builds queuing database tables](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7438).

For more technical details about this topic see
[pipeline data partitioning design](pipeline_partitioning.md).

## Iterations

All three tracks can be worked on in parallel:

1. [Reduce the rate of builds metadata table growth](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7434).
1. [Partition CI/CD pipelines database tables](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5417).
1. [Partition CI/CD queuing tables using list partitioning](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7438)

## Status

In progress.
