## The Sales Dev Index

Please follow the table below to quickly find the most relevant place for what you're looking for. You can also use the searching method [explained here](/handbook/tools-and-tips/searching/) to increase your searching capabilities.

Our handbook page has contributions from a diverse team. To help you efficienctly find answers, we highly suggest that you `cmnd+F` this page as a best searching practice.

Try searching for as many permutations of what you're looking for. For example, if you want to find information on lead scoring search for keywords like `score, scoring, lead, leads, scoring`. Remember that [information retrieval](/teamops/shared-reality/) is a core GitLab value, and a skill that will make a big difference in your careers.

If you can't find what you're looking for please reach out to a member of the Sales Dev Ops team and we'll help you find it, or update the handbook to include it!

## How we typically help the teams we work with

| What is your role and ask? | How will the Sales Dev Org help |
| ------ | ----- |
| I am Field Marketer, and want to have people invited to my event | We typically work with the FM process outlined on the issue template called `FM-BDR-Collaboration-Template` that can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/issues/new), but are always eager to collaborate in making your events more succesful, if your ask is not covered in the template linked above, please write to us on the #sales_dev_global slack channel and we'll jump in to assist. |
| I am an Account Executive, and want to nominate accounts for outbounding efforts | Our end-to-end outbound process [is here](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/how-tos/#how-to-follow-our-fo-outbound-process). The easiest way to automate your workflow is to find the field BDR Prospecting Status on the SFDC Account record, and select the Queued option from there. The BDR team will then pick it up and research it for their outbound pipeline. |
| I am an Account Executive, and want to check the state of accounts, or quality of prospects, in my territory | Our BDR team uses a set of [1:1 dashboards](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-sfdc-dashboards) that consolidate all relevant resources in one place. Our BDR team typically uses these on 1:1s with the Sales team to facilitate better account and territory planning. |
| I am a Field Marketer, or Account Executive, and want to suggest that the SDR or BDR team uses my messaging for reaching out to prospects or clients | We have a [quick process](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/sales-development-vault/#field-marketing--bdr-collaboration-process) for creating new flows on Groove, our messaging tool. Even though the BDR or SDR are the ones typically creating these requests, we always welcome collaboration with other teams so feel free to log your own request directly if you'd like. |
| I am a Sales Manager, and want to gauge the quality and progress of the SAOs provided to my team. | We have a robust set of pipeline [progression dashboards](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-sfdc-dashboards) that break down results in a lot of granularity. We also have a structured path for handing off opportunities from the SDR/BDR teams to the AE team that you can use to measure adherance to qualification criteria and [next steps](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/sales-development-vault/#sdrbdr-to-ae-sao-handoff-process). |

## Our How-Tos for the Inbound and Outbound processes

### Where to find your leads and accounts

Inbound leads get automatically imported to SFDC by the Sales Operations team, you can find links to their handbook pages on our [main page](/handbook/marketing/sales-development).

To find and access your leads, please:

1. Navigate to SFDC's homepage
1. Click on the `Leads` tab.

You will find the lead views below. These views are split per use-case for your convenience. The KPIs for managing these leads are thoroughly outlined in our [SLAs page](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#inbound-lead-management).

#### SDR Lead Views

| View   | Description                                                                                                        |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| S1 - High Priority View | These are leads that are marked as High Priority because of some high Propensity To Purchase indication. |
| S1 View | These are your net new leads that have scored high enough to reach MQL status.                                            |
| S2 View | This is a view of your existing leads that also have an associated phone call so you can easily reference your callable pipeline. |
| S3 View | Qualifying leads. These are leads that you are actively qualifying in a back and forth conversation either by email or through phone calls. Each lead needs to either be active in a follow-up Flow, have an active task, or have a future meeting scheduled which can be seen in a future "last activity" date. |

#### BDR Lead Views

| View                           | Description|
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FY26 B1 - My Leads, Action Needed       | Includes any leads that we have committed to follow up on ASAP. These are our highest converting leads and are a mix between High Priority and MQL's PTP is now part of our scoring so there may be leads in there that have MQLd due to PTP so you'll have to click into the lead to see more. High Priority leads belong to a High Priority campaign - you can find which one at the bottom of the page in the campaigns section.                                                                   |
| FY26 B2 - AWA leads w/ LIM             | Includes leads in your name and that match to your Actively Working Accounts. It's best to sort these by Last Interesting Moment Date and consider the Lead Classification Score when deciding which one to add to Groove Flow. We do not surface leads that were added to Flows in the last 14 days.                                                                                                                        |
| FY26 B3 - Change Owner AWA's (Clone)   |  This view however allows you to see leads that may not have been moved into your name because at the time, they did not meet criteria. These could be bc: the leads were in lead statuses of: Accepted, MQL, or Qualifying when you moved the account into Actively Working since leads with those statuses should stay with the owner currently working them.   |
| FY26 B4 - My HT Leads W/ Phone         | This view should be used when either you do not have enough daily call tasks in Groove to hit your daily KPI or when your team wants to do a call blitz etc. It allows you to easily pull into Groove and create additional call tasks for your leads currently in high touch flows.                                                                                                                             |
| FY26 B5 - My Qualifying Leads          | These are leads in qualifying status which means some sort of two-way engagement happened between you two. Please review this section of our handbook for best converting follow-up practices.                                                                                        |
| FY26 B6 - 6QA Imported Leads  | leads in your ownership related to accounts that have just hit 6QA status in this view. 6QA means the account has been shown to have high intent signals and has similar signs to other accounts that have purchased from us. We have brought in appropriate titles from ZoomInfo so that when you move the 6QA account into Actively Working, you have some leads all ready for sequencing.|
| FY26 B7 - AWS Prospecting Last 7 Days  | These are leads in qualifying status which means some sort of two-way engagement happened between you two.

| B1 View | Includes MQL's, Hot contacts that require quick follow up. NOTE: Not all of these contacts will be in your Actively Working Accounts list as all contacts where you are BDR Assigned on account are in your ownership, so please ensure that you set the account BDR Prospecting Status to Actively Working if you engage in discussions with the contact so that you can continue working the account and expand your outreach, otherwise any new lead MQLs for the account will route to the SDRs .                                                                                                                                                        |

### How to do Lead Database Management

As part of your SDR responsibilities, you are expected to perform due diligence on each lead you receive. This includes checking the database for duplicate records, as well as referencing against our [RoE](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/roe-kpis-faq/).

1. Open the lead you want to investigate and press the `Find Duplicates` on the top of the lead's record.
1. Check through all the records that show up, from leads to Acccounts. Make sure to search for `Domain` and `Last Name` if the data you have seems incomplete.
1. Check the `Matched Account Info` section on the lead record.
   1. For SMB leads, if there's a matched account where the type is `Customer`, please press the `Convert` button at the top of the lead page and match this lead to the existing account.
   1. If there's not a customer record but you find an existing open opportunity, update the `Lead Status` to `Recycle` and `Recycle Reasons` to `Evaluating.`
   1. For Universities/Education leads (non-US Pub Sec), work as regular lead if technical contact.
   1. If there's a matched account, check if the field `BDR Prospecting Status` is `Actively Working` and, if so, reroute the lead to the team mentioned on the `BDR Assigned` field.
   1. If the existing account is not marked as `Actively Working`, check for duplicate leads or contacts and merge if necessary while keeping the oldest `Initial Source`.
   1. If the `Company Address` fields on the lead record do not match your research online of the company, please update the `Admin Company Override fields` that are found in the `Lead/Contact Review Admin` section. As a further fail-safe step, you'll be asked to verify that this due diligence is done prior to converting this person to a new account.
1. If there's no matched account, but there's another lead at same company that has the `MQL` status, assign both leads to the owner with the earliest `MQL Date`.
   1. If there's no matched account, but there's another lead that has the `Accepted` or `Qualifying` status, assign the new MQL to the owner of the accepted/qualifying leads.
1. BDRs receiving leads not associated with `Actively Working` accounts must assign back to SDR team or chatter mktgops support.
1. Qualified leads associated with "Actively Working" accounts are routed to BDR assigned to the Actively Working Account.

#### Telco and Finserv Routing

For leads that connect to companies that operate in the Financial Services (AMER only) and Telecommunications (EMEA only) industries. We have a seperate routing process that supercedes all of our current [Rules of Engagement](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/roe-kpis-faq/#rules-of-engagement-roe).

Only named TELCO/FinServe accounts are rolling up to the TELCO/FinServe territories. If a new account is a subsidiary of an existing carved company, it will need to be assigned to the AE owning the ultimate account. If it is a totally separate entity then it can be allocated to the regional AE. If a lead comes in that is related to a TELCO/FinServe account, it must be assigned to the BDR assigned on the account.

#### Company Address Based Routing Information

In **[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT-oOceFU6k&ab_channel=GitLabUnfiltered)**, a member of the Marketing Ops team goes over the Company address fields and how they are used for Accounting Routing and Opp assignment.

If you need to do edits to the database by merging leads together for any of the above steps, please reference the videos below for an explanation.

#### Chatter Guide for Troubleshooting

If you'd like the assistance of another person or team, you can use SFDC chatter on the lead record. Please reference the guide below:

| Problem                                                | Who to Chatter                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A SMB/MM Contact Request and the account is a customer | Chatter the Account Owner and inform them of the context of the message.          |
| A BDR receives an MQL Lead that is not from an Actively Working Account | Chatter @mktops                                                        |
| If you feel a lead has been misrouted                 | Chatter @mktops                                                                  |
| There is a Duplicate Account                           | Chatter Sales Support and ask them to merge the accounts.                         |
| An Opp has moved into Stage 1 but has Incorrect Data  | Chatter your manager who will then reach out to someone in Sales Dev Operations.   |
| Unclear Territory Assignment                           | Chatter an AE from each of the potential territories.                              |
| Requesting SAO Credit on an Opp                        | Chatter Sales Dev Ops or the Director of Commercial Sales Development.            |
| Account is in Restricted Status                        | Chatter the SAE and ask permission to reach out.                                   |

#### Cleaning Poor Leads

Lastly, Every so often you may be assigned a lead that has no value to GitLab and is not worth keeping within our database. Qualities that define these types of leads include:

| Step                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Identify leads with no value to GitLab                  | Look for leads with characteristics such as incoherent or obviously forged information, or email addresses from temporary domains that self-terminate.            |
| Verify lead removal necessity                           | Ensure that the leads meet the criteria for removal and are unlikely to provide any value to GitLab.                                                                  |
| Add leads to the SPAM DELETION Salesforce campaign      | Add the identified leads to the SPAM DELETION campaign in Salesforce. Make sure to be 100% certain about the removal, as this process is irreversible.               |
| Note campaign membership, not status                    | Remember that only campaign membership matters for this process, so the campaign member status used when adding to the campaign does not affect the removal process. |
| Understand the permanence of lead removal               | Realize that leads removed through this process cannot be recovered by MktgOps, making the removal permanent. Exercise caution when initiating lead removals.         |
| Be aware of the removal schedule and exceptions         | Note that the removal process occurs daily at 12:05 am PDT via Marketo. For unscheduled removals, request assistance in the mktgops Slack channel but minimize requests. |
| Request email domain blocking if necessary              | If you observe multiple leads with the same domain, create an issue with Marketing Ops to add the domain to a block list, preventing future occurrences.           |

### How to action your leads

**1. Determining High-touch or Low-touch Groove Flow usage:**

1. Determine if the lead qualifies for a high touch or low touch Flow.
   - High touch Flows are for higher-quality leads and require more personalization and touch points, including phone calls and LinkedIn Connect requests. This should be the majority of your pipeline.
   - Low touch Flows are typically automated and run for a shorter period of time. You can use Low-touch for leads where a phone number cannot be found online or in our databases, or where their contact information is incomplete and cannot be enriched by our tools, or through manual research. Low touch should only be reserved as the last resort.
1. Research the appropriate Groove collections for relevant collateral to be used. Most typically our High-Touch Collection or Low-Touch collections.

#### Cold-Calling and Email Checkbox

Before calling any Lead or Contact, BDRs must ensure that the `Do Not Call` box is unchecked.  If you speak to any anyone, including prospects and existing contacts, who ask you not to call them again, you must check this box. However, please do not delete the number as we need to know which number requested not to be called again. For any individuals who are opted-in to email, you may ask them if they wish to be called. If they express a desire to be called, you are then permitted to uncheck the `Do Not Call` box if it was previously checked.  Also, if an individual expresses independently via email a wish to be called, you may uncheck the `Do Not Call` box.  This email must be present in SFDC as proof of your authority to uncheck this box.  You cannot send email requests to individuals not opted-in to email asking whether they would like to be called.

Our cold-calling best practices typically consist of 4 elements. A pattern interrupt, an elevator pitch and, if required, objection/trap-setting questions and Up-Front Contracts.

To be effective, these need to be customized to the individuals we call as per the logic below:

- Different Geographical Business Cultures
- Personality Type as per the DISC model
- Individual's Role and Responsibilities
- Business' Needs and Objectives

An unsubscribe link must be included on every email sent by a BDR, including responses to a prospect or contact. Please reach out to the Privacy Team via #privacy-team-help for the recommended language that should appear at the bottom of each outbound email.

#### Do Not Call and Do Not Email Automations

Leads with certain criteria will be automatically labeled as **Do Not Call** and or **Do Not Email** shortly after loading into our database. It's understandable this can be frustrating for certain territories. Please keep in mind, the criteria behind this automation has been set in order to follow local law. Please see the [Internal GitLab handbook](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-ops-and-analytics/marketing-operations/do-not-contact/?search=do+not+call) for more information on the triggers.

### How to Enroll to Groove by Clari

[Groove](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/groove/index.html/#about-grooveco) is a tool used to automate emails in the form of flows. Users can track open rates, click-through rates, and response rates for various templates, and update flows based on these metrics. Groove also helps to track sales activities such as calls. All emails/calls/tasks made through Groove are automatically logged in Salesforce with a corresponding disposition. See below for instructions on how to enroll leads in Groove:

1. Go to your SDR views in Salesforce and select the lead you want to add to a flow.
2. Press `Add To Groove Flow`.
3. Work from the Groove extension on Chrome to select the flow you want to enroll the lead in by using the labels feature.
4. Once the first step of a Groove flow is complete, the lead status will automatically change from `MQL`, `Inquiry`, or `Raw` to `Accepted`, marking that you are actively working on this lead.
5. When a lead responds to your outreach, their status will automatically change from `Accepted` to `Qualifying`. Manage these leads from your S3 and B5 lead views.
6. If you are not actively qualifying this lead further, manually change the status to `Recycle`, so the lead is returned to the Marketing recycle pool and isn't stuck in your `My Qualifying` view.
7. If you speak with the lead by phone and are qualifying them, manually change the status from `Accepted` to `Qualifying`.
8. When reviewing your `Qualifying` view, add leads with no recent activity, no active tasks, and not currently in a flow into one of our follow-up Groove Flows under the `MOTION: Follow-Up` category.
9. Tasks and pipeline management can be done via Groove's [Actions View](https://groove.clari.com/actions).
10. In the Actions View, review the list of leads assigned to you by navigating to the play-icon button for each to start their corresponding action for the day.
11. If a lead completes a Groove flow without responding, the lead status will automatically change to `Unresponsive` or `Recycle` after seven days of no response.
12. Manually change the lead status if you do not use a Groove flow to reach out or if you need to disqualify a lead (e.g., for bad data).
13. If you mark a lead as `Inactive` or a contact as `Inactive`, signifying that this person no longer works at the company, any running Flow will automatically be marked as finished.
14. If your leads are being reassigned to the `Inquiry Queue`, it’s likely due to a scheduled cleanup job in Traction that updates `Status = Inquiry` to `Inquiry Queue`. To resolve this, add your leads to a Groove flow.
    - **Note:** The cleanup job runs daily at 10:30 PM EST/EDT.

#### Groove Labels

We've organized our **Groove Labels** into key categories like **industry, region, play/motion**, or **language** to help you efficiently retrieve the most appropriate content quickly.

#### How to Use Groove Labels

On the top-hand of the [flows page](https://groove.clari.com/flows), access the filter menu and search per `label`.

1. **Industry**: Industry-specific labels that group flows per similar sectors.
2. **Region**: Flows organized by geographical regions, enabling you to target leads with more region-appropriate cadences based on local business culture.
3. **Play/Motion**: Each label within this category represents a specific sales play or marketing motion. These labels help you align leads with the appropriate strategy based a company's and customer's identified value-drivers.
4. **Language**: Language-based labels to ensure that you can easily find non-English collateral for our global audience.

#### Groove Templates

We've organized our **Groove Templates** in the same way as our **Groove Labels** —by **industry, region, play/motion**, and **language**—to streamline your outreach efforts. These templates provide consistency and efficiency, and need to be created regardless if you're sending one-off messages or using templates to structure a flow.

We currently have one master SalesDev folder for saving templates, please ensure that any templates that you create are saved under that folder, and tagged with the appropriate collection as per the logic outlined above.

In both cases, it’s essential to tag your templates with the appropriate collection name to maintain consistency and help others easily locate them for future use.

#### New Groove Flow creation

Please follow the instructions on [the Groove handbook page here](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/groove/index.html)

**Implement Measurement Clarity and Decision Velocity**

By dogfooding GitLab we have a structured and simplified cadence of quantifying Flowe creation in terms of value and results without limiting agency.

**Maintain Equal Contributions in a Shared Reality**
By maintaing a Single Source of Truth (SSoT) we give the best possible forum for cross-functional collaboration with specific guidelines

**Important Note: Ramping BDRs**
Ramping BDRs should only be using OB Flows from the Good and Testing collections. A ramping BDR can only create a Flow Creation Request if there is no Flows that fit their needs or strategy in our current library.

#### Follow Up Groove Flows

For SDRs and BDRs managing leads in their qualifying views, we've created [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbvSCY7mESc) to guide you through using follow-up Groove Flows.

Please visit the Groove Flows page and search for the tag `MOTION: Follow-up` to review your available options.

#### White Glove Event Follow Up Flows

For more personal events, such as Executive Roundtables, there may be more detailed Last Event Notes that include a request to involve people who interacted with the prospect at the event. For these situations, we have specialized white glove Flows. These can be found by searching for the tag `MOTION: White Glove`

The goal of these Flows is to reach out to the prospect quickly and to include our SAEs/AEs in the conversation.

- The first step is to add the prospect to the Flow. Then, customize the first email step to include the individuals mentioned in the Last Event Notes. You can also delay the first email to allow time for feedback from the SAE/AE if needed.
- Next, send a screenshot of the first email step to the SAE/AEs who will be CC'd. Explain that this strategy allows them to engage with more personalized messaging if the prospect remains unresponsive.
  - **Note:** There is a generic task on Day 12 to follow up with the SAE/AE if there has been no engagement. The goal is to keep them informed and work together to engage the prospect.

### High Priority Campaigns and Leads

A High Priority Lead is a lead that is related to a high priority campaign. Any campaign checked as High Priority will have any members that relate to Actively Working accounts marked as High Priority irregardless of their lead status. These will show up in the BDR's B1 priority view. Check the high priority timestamp and high priority reason fields in salesforce to understand why a lead was marked high priority.

If you need to move a lead out of high prioriy without contacting them you can [use this flow.](https://groove.clari.com/flows/1097000) This flow is one generic task for you to complete that will move the lead to accepted status and remove the high priority check.

#### How to Change your Email Signature

You must change your email signature [in Terminus](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/terminus-email-experiences/) in order for your signature to save. If you only change your signature in Groove or Gmail your signature will revert back within 24 hours.

**Steps to change your signature**

1. [Log into Terminus](https://email2.terminusplatform.com/users/sign_in/) using your GitLab Google Account
1. After logging in click on the Terminus logo in the top left corner
1. Next click the menu item for "Email Experiences"
1. From there you can edit your signature and see a preview of it on the right side of your screen.

### How to follow our FO Outbound Process

BDR outbound lead generation is done by prospecting to companies and individuals who could be a great fit for our product. Prospecting is the process of finding and developing new business through searching for potential customers with the end goal of moving these people through the sales funnel until they eventually convert into customers.

BDRs will work closely with their dedicated SAE or AE to choose which accounts move into "Actively Working". Together they will build a strategy for those companies. It is crucial that outreach is very intentional and strategic. When reaching out, we want BDRs to offer value and become a trusted advisor, ensuring a positive impression is left whether there is current demand or not.

The FO Outbound process is split in four phases, which should be followed on a weekly basis to ensure a steady outbound pipeline in alignment with our internal KPIs. To manage this process we use a set of datapoints on SFDC on the account-level that are marked under the section "BDR Comments". Please reference the guide below on an explanation on how they work.

| BDR Field              | Usage                                                                                                         |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BDR Prospecting Status | Denotes whether an account is currently actively being worked, marked queued for future review, is restricted from being worked, or has been worked in the past. |
| Actively Working Start Date | Gets populated automatically when an account is moved to Actively Working (AW) Status and the rest of the field is populated, marking it a valid AW account. |
| BDR Account Research   | A space for the BDR to document their research and rationale for prospecting this account. A template is provided in step 5 of the guide below. |
| BDR Next Steps         | A space for the BDR to use as working notes for the current status of prospecting the account.                |
| BDR Account Strategy   | A categorization system that we use to high-level denote what motion or play was used in trying to engage with an account. |
| BDR Recycle Date       | Automatically populated two months out from the AW date. Can be manually changed if the BDR chooses to continue working an account. |
| 6QA Acceptance Status and 6QA Dispute Reason. | When an account has been automatically moved to Actively Working and Showing Intent, as per the 6QA project outlined [here](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#6sense-6qa-automations), you will need to review the account and change this field to Accepted or Disputed within 48 hours. In case of choosing to Dispute the account you will need to choose a Dispute reason. Use `Account in open opportunity` if there is an SDR with an active open opportunity. These accounts will be flagged on the 1:1 Dashboard for you to review with your manager and other collaborators. |

#### Planning Phase (4-5 hours/week)

**1A. Create a set of achievable objectives**

These goals should be based on what you know you can achieve when focusing on First Order accounts. It is particularly important to know your equation so you can map your activities to specific outcomes and goals in a predictable way.

The main objective you should be focusing at is to measure and plan what activity is required to achieve or increase the amount of First Order meetings.

**1B. Map your objectives to your data** <br>

Research your territory to identify the true First Order (FO) accounts, ensuring no other subsidiaries have licenses, verifying there hasn't been a lost renewal in the past 180 days, and confirming there are no open opportunities. The goal here is to vet your TAM (Total Addresable Market) so that you can start matching cohorts of accounts with the objectives that you've outlined in the previous step. Indicatively, you can export these accounts to a Google Sheet, or other SSoT of your preference, for tracking since these accounts will be marked as Actively Working at a future step further down the process.

Utilizing these accounts, create an outreach strategy and plan for the upcoming month and quarter. This strategy should include considerations such as the number of accounts to include in Flows per week and per month, the quantity of prospects from these accounts to add into Flows weekly, whether you intend to target specific personas, if you plan to employ targeted messaging, whether Flows will be used for high-priority targets, and the messaging approach you will implement. As previously mentioned, knowing your equation is important for your planning here. Please refer to the sheet linked above to determine your exact metrics.

#### Account Research Phase (4-5 hours/week)

During your research phase for accounts to include in your Flows, thoroughly investigate and document pertinent information, which may include the below.

This comprehensive research will provide valuable insights for crafting effective outreach strategies further down the funnel. Regarding account research, in addition to our B2B database toolstack, we also use 6Sense to pre-qualify the accounts that should be considered for our pipelines since 6Sense scores accounts based on their market and profile fit.

There are two ways utilize 6Sense:

- Through the SFDC iframe integrated dashboard (mandatory for FY24Q3)
- Through the 6Sense Platform (optional for this Quarter)

#### 2A. Using 6Sense through the SFDC dashboard

1. Navigate to SFDC
1. On the main tab with options (leads, accounts, etc), click on the "+" sign
1. Select 6Sense dashboards, you can also click "customize my tabs" to add the 6sense dashboard
   to your homepage permanently
1. On the 6Sense dashboard, click the cog icon on the top right
1. On "Search by User" select "BDR Assigned" and add your name
1. On "Other filters" select "Salesforce Account fields" and type "BDR Prospecting Status"
1. On the "BDR Prospecting Status" field, select "Actively Working"

The dashboard will now display the top actively working accounts in your name. Do note that these are only accounts that we currently have on our database, while you can find greenfield accounts by visiting the SaaS platform (instructions in section 2B). Section 3 below explains how you can review and utilize this data.

#### 2B. Using 6Sense through the SaaS platform

Navigate to 6Sense through Okta
On the left-hand bar, click on the Segments tab
You will find all of the relevant resources for BDRs and SDRs on the first 5 folders. These folders can be used as per the table below.
(In each folder you will find a saved template that can be cloned and edited for your individual territories.)

| Folder                       | Usage                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. AWA'd Accounts          | These segments will display the top accounts in your current actively working list according to 6Sense intent data. By manually investigating each of those accounts you will be able to uncover further prospect engagement data, and adjust your strategy in converting this account. This report has the same functionality as the SFDC dashboard outlined in step 2A. |
| 2. Non-AWA Greenfield Accounts | These segments will display the top accounts in your territory that we do not have on our SFDC database. These accounts should be manually investigated and considered for adding to your outbound pipeline. Note that we have approx. 15% of our TAM on our SFDC database, while these reports are an automated way to identify great accounts from the other 85% of the TAM in your territory. Please note that the Sales Dev Ops team is here to work with you to generate these reports, as the particularities of our Sales Territories require some editing with the filters. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us so we help you work through these. |
| 3. Non-AWA SFDC Accounts   | These segments display the accounts that currently hold on our database that display high 6sense intent scores, but are not part of your actively working list.                      |

After choosing the type of report you'd like to work, please follow the steps below:

1. Select the template in each of the BDR folders that starts with the prefix "-[TEMPLATE]".
1. On the title, add your name or territory as suggested by the naming convention. Please make sure to delete the Prefix "-[TEMPLATE]".
1. Click on "Edit Segment".
1. For folders 1 and 3, you'll see a prompt on one of the filters to add your name to the "BDR Assigned" Field.
1. For folder 2, you'll see a prompt to add your region to the "Address: Region" field. Do note that based on your territory there are other datapoints like "Address: City" or "Address: Country" that can be used.
1. After having done the edits on steps 4 and 5, press "Save Changes". Make sure that you've updated the naming convention accordingly and click "Save As New Segment".

#### 3. Manual Research on Accounts

No matter how efficiently we're trying to use our toolchain, these tools are still prone to error, and manual research is required to best shortlist the prospecting lists that cross-referencing will provide.Manual research will also provide additional context that can be used to hyper-personalize your outreach to your prospects.

For each account that you want to investigate, start with SFDC to make sure that there are no duplicate accounts. The report templates in 6Sense should exclude existing customers or accounts actively prospected, but we cannot automatically exclude accounts that have a different naming or domain on salesforce (ie. GitLab and GTLB)

The importance of diligent manual research will lead to the below efficiencies:

→ Better use of time in the long-run by making sure accounts are indeed within your segment and territory, or are not duplicates. <br>
→ Avoiding unecessary RoE conflicts by making sure there are no hidden parent accounts that would cause SAO ownership to be re-assigned to other segments in the future.

**1. To double-check the account on Salesforce:**

1. Search for the account name on SFDC.
1. Search for the account email domain on SFDC.
1. Search for the account website domain on SFDC.
1. Search for the Account's HQ address, along with any regional business unit address.

**2. To hyper-personalize your messaging:**

Please follow the steps below to understand how to research the data provided on 6Sense, and to cross-reference this data with our internal knowledge base so that you create your account strategy accordingly.

1. Understand and utilize 6Sense data: Each segment has an accounts tab that displays all the accounts that correspond to this segment. This view can be shortlisted further by using the three analytics tabs as all datapoints in these tabs is clickable.
   - **Predictive Analytics** filters accounts by their propensity to buy. This data can be used to split prospecting efforts between high-priority outbound campaigns and low-priority awareness campaigns
   - **Behavioural Analytics** filters accounts by the intent/value-driver that they mostly focused on. This data can be used to split accounts into specific value-driver focused campaigns.
   - **Profile Analytics** filter accounts by the demographic of each company in terms of location or size. This data can be used to run location-specific campaigns.
1. Search for past opportunities on SFDC
   1. Check the qualification notes
   1. Check the unqualified reasons by the AE team
   1. Check past email communication on the activity records
1. Search for the account record on SFDC
   1. Check Account Rank notes by the AE team
   1. Check the PathFactory, ZoomInfo, Marketo integration tabs
   1. Check their product usage information (if applicable)
   1. Check their LAM Dev Count
1. Search for relevant leads on SFDC:
   1. Check for past communication
   1. Check for Last Interesting Moment and how it connects to their title and lead source to determine their compelling events
   1. Check for Web Activity on Marketo and PathFactory to gauge past interest
1. Cross-reference with External sources
   1. Search LinkedIn Insights for company growth, financials and recent news
   1. Search company webpage for recent news, career openings or specific technologies used
   1. Search online sources like newsletter or crunchbase
1. Cross-reference the above with HighSpot
   1. Check for relevant playbooks based on company size
   1. Check for relevant messaging based on persona
   1. Check for relevant pain-points based on value driver

#### Execution Phase (5-10 hours/week)

**Exporting Accounts and Leads to SFDC, and adding to your Outbound Pipeline.**

After having manually shortlisted the accounts that are applicable to your campaign, the next step is to determine the relevant prospects per account and export them to SFDC. It is important to add accounts to your outbound pipeline so that AEs and other SDRs/BDRs know this is an account that is already being touched, and to avoid confusion or multiple people approaching the same prospects. Before moving an account into "Actively Working Status", make sure there have been no MQLs or opportunities created from that account within the past 30 days, and there are no leads from that account in Qualifying status with activity in the last 30 days or with a future task date set. If you are not sure, double-check with the related AE, SDR or BDR.

To determine which prospects to enroll per account, please follow the steps below:

- Identify the idea value drivers to be used for the account's pain-points through your manual research, as outlined above.
- Determine which personas would most benefit from the specific value drivers by using our CoM documentation on HighSpot.
- Run queries for the specific titles on ZoomInfo, and export to CRM.

You should explore the specific personas you intend to target, such as: VPs, Directors, Developers, Security, Architecture, DevOps, DevSecOps, Procurement Officers, and IT Buyers.

Determine the number of prospects you plan to add to Flows, with a minimum of 25 per day. Utilize LinkedIn Sales Navigator, ZoomInfo or Cognism to identify these personas within your target companies.

In Step 7, compile the selected prospects and create LinkedIn Sales Navigator lists for each persona. Save these lists for future use.

**To export to CRM, please follow the guidelines below:**

- Click the Export to CRM button on ZoomInfo
- That's it
- No, really.

**To fill in the BDR fields, please follow the guidelines below:**

Use the [format found on this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EN2U8wrUdti4MTxCNceoOlltAmtUt4pqN1GxwRTCnK4/edit)
Copy-Paste the Structure to the BDR Account Research field and populate accordingly.
Populate the BDR Next Step Date to be at the end of the account's Flows length (typically one month out)

#### 6. Maintaining a clean pipeline, and using BDR fields for cross-functional collaboration

To review your current pipeline, along with any leads with next steps, please refer to your segments dashboards by going to SFDC > Dashboards and searching for Watch and Help.

Team specific variants of these dashboard components will also be found on your team's dashboard. These dashboards will give you a bird's eye view of what actions are required from to maintain a clean pipeline, in terms of: i. Accounts with BDR fields past due ii. <br> Prospects with Flow steps past due <br> iii. Prospects that have been moved to Qualifying status but have not had any outreach since.

### How to Get SAO Credit and Create Opportunities

Qualification criteria is a minimum set of characteristics that a lead must have in order to be passed to sales and become a Sales Accepted Opportunity (SAO), these are split into [Inbound and Outbound Criteria.](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#opportunities)

As an SDR or BDR, you will work to connect with inbound/outbound leads that you get a response from to obtain the applicable information required. This information is tracked on the qualification criteria on the `LEAD, CONTACT, and OPPORTUNITY` objects in Salesforce. In order to obtain an SAO, you will need to have the `required information` filled out on the opportunity including documented 2-way communication on the Contacts in the Opportunity. Professional Services opportunities are not credited to sales development, these need to be passed straight to the account AEs for them to qualify.

**When do I create an Opportunity?**

1. **You have scheduled time with AE/SAE to speak with the prospect:**
If you are scheduling time with an AE/SAE to speak to the prospect based on a qualifying conversation you have had with the prospect, an opportunity needs to be created and placed in stage 0. On the opportunity, all "required qualification" fields need to be filled in.

1. **You have obtained a commitment/willigness from a prospect to discuss further.**
If you have a meaningful two-way communication with a prospect, but have not had the required qualification criteria to move to the Sales team, you can create an opportunity under your name so that you better track your warm conversations. These opportunities may also be used for better collaboration with your team, as they can be reviewed and brain-stormed upon during team meetings.

**Who owns the opportunity at this point?**

1. **You have scheduled time with AE/SAE to speak with the prospect.**
When you have entered the qualification criteria onto the opportunity, and have received calendar confirmation from all parties for the intro call with sales, you will change ownership to the AE/SAE. After you have saved opp owner, you will add yourself to the BDR/SDR field. The opportunity will remain in stage 0.

1. **You have obtained a commitment/willigness from a prospect to discuss further.**
At this point, the opportunity will be in your ownership but you can not have yourself listed in the Business Development Representative or Sales Development Representative field. There is a validation rule that will not allow the opp owner and the SDR/BDR representative field to be the same member.

**When will it be credited as an SAO?**

After the AE/SAL meets with the prospect to verify and supplement qualification criteria, they will move the opportunity into Stage 1 Discovery. The AE/SAL is expected to move the opportunity into the correct stage within 48 hours of the meeting reflected in the "Next Step" date field. The opportunity close date defaults to the last day of the quarter, however it's good practice to set the date at least 90 days out from creation date.

If an opportunity has incorrect data after it has moved into Stage 1 - Discovery, please Chatter your manager about the required changes, they will then Chatter someone from Sales Dev Operations (Ramona, Panos, Ed) once final changes are agreed upon. No one else from Sales Dev can edit opportunities once they are in Stage 1, so please try and ensure you have all the information on the opportunity before you ask the AE/SAL to accept it.

If the opportunity is for a new group of users in a Large account where sales is working on a large "central" opportunity, then your opportunity should be merged to that opportunity for you to get credit for the users you have brought to the deal. See under [Stage 8](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#opportunity-stages) in the Sales Go To Market Handbook.

#### Opportunity Creation Workflow

![Opp-Creation-Workflow](/images/marketing/sales-development/FY24OpportunityCreationWorkflow.png)

#### Scheduling IQMs

**Creating Opportunities:**

1. **Identify and Relate Communications**: Identify relevant two-way communications with the prospect, such as email exchanges, call records, or LI messages. Ensure that these are properly logged in SFDC associated with the `person, company, and opportunity records` as needed. To do this:
   1. Select the specific activity records highlighting your involvement and press `related to`.
   1. Select the corresponding Opportunity and press Save.
   1. Select specific activity records highlighting your involvement and press `related to`
   1. Select the corresponding Opportunity and press `Select specific activity records highlighting your involvement` and press `related to`
   1. Select the corresponding Opportunity and press save.
1. **Verify Sales Organization RoE**: On ZoomInfo, or other established sources if needed, verify the parent/child segmentation and the HQ of the company or ultimate user.
   - If discrepancies exist, communicate with the appropriate personnel for resolution.
1. Overriding Incorrect Account Assignments**
   1. Navigate to the `Lead/Contact Review Admin` section in Salesforce to input correct information.
   1. After making sure that the information is properly reflected on the `Company Address` fields (ie: **Company Address: Street**), please tick the `Company Address Checked` checkbox on the lead level. If this step is not completed, then you will receive a message to remind you on Salesforce when you try to convert the lead.

   If unsuccessful, communicate with the Sales Dev Director for assistance in updating account records.
1. **Schedule IQM**: For booking meetings, use [Groove Meetings](https://clari.my.site.com/customer/articles/Knowledge/Meeting-Scheduler) to expedite the experience for prospects.
   1. Make sure to give a 24 hour notice to the AEs.
   1. Having sent a meeting invitation, ask the prospect to accept while on the phone/meeting with them.
1. **AE Review**: Expect AEs to verify that they reviewed the opportunity beforehand.
   - If needed, review the specifics of the call, responsibilities, and send meeting reminders.
1. **Attending the IQM**: Please make sure that both AE and SDR show up on time or up to 5 minutes beforehand with Cameras on.
   - Please ensure that the location is quiet and indoors for AE and SDR.
1. **Debrief**: Have a goal for the AE and SDR to debrief within 24 hours regarding the opportunity being flipped or being disqualified.
   - Ensure that feedback is shared in writing via Slack/email and added to Salesforce by the AE.
1. **IQM Notes**: SDR adds IQM notes to the Initiative section in the opportunity Title.
   - Include Attendees, Raw Notes, Questions, Summary, and Next Steps.
1. **Rebooking no-shows**: The SDR's responsibility lies only in rebooking no-shows using a structured Groove Flow.
   - Conduct outreach for 2 weeks. If IQM cannot be rescheduled, AE will unqualify the opportunity.

#### Trial Extensions and Ultimate to Premium Downgrades

To submit a trial extension ticket for a prospect you will navigate [to this internal request form](https://support-super-form-gitlab-com-support-support-op-651f22e90ce6d7.gitlab.io/) and fill it out the form using the **"GitLab L&R internal request for global customers"** option and then select extend a gitlab.com trial. Keep in mind it only works for SaaS and not self-managed.

You are also able to downgrade a Trial from Ultimate to Premium through the internal request form. You just have to choose "Change existing GitLab.com Trial plan"

#### Opportunity Naming Convention 

- New Business: [Quantity]
  - [Name of Company]- [Quantity] [Edition]
  - Example: Acme, Inc- 50 Premium
- Add-On Business (seats only):
  - [Name of Company]- Add [Quantity] [Product]
  - Example: Acme, Inc- Add 25 Duo
- Add-On Business (Upgrade from Premium to Ultimate):
  - [Name of Company]- Upgrade to Ultimate
  - Example: Acme, Inc- Upgrade to Ultimate

### Monthly Audit Process

In an effort to increase transparency as well as consistency in terms of credit attribution for opportunities sourced by the Sales Development organization, we will conduct on a monthly basis a full audit of all opportunities giving credit to either a Sales Development or a Business Development Representative. Please do note that SDRs/BDRs that are on their ramping quarter are exempt from being auditors.

Participating and completing the audit on time is mandatory.

Guiding principles:

1. All activities must be logged and documented in Salesforce. <br>
1. Timestamps for such activities will be audited and cannot be modified after the fact
Sourcing cases must be clearly documented. <br>
1. All opportunities associated with a Sales Development team member must have meaningful engagement for Web Directs and full qualifications criteria for Direct Deals.

**Mandatory SLA:** Audit and XDR response must be completed by the first day of the following month. Rulings will be completed by the management team by the end of the second day.  Invitations and pairing will be sent to the entire Sales Dev team the first week of the month. It is the responsibility of the team member to find a backfill to do their audit if they are unable to complete the audit within set timelines.

#### XDR'S RESPONSIBILITY

1. All activities must be logged in Salesforce.
Pro-actively flag opportunities with questions or created outside the standard process in the monthly [Audit Doc.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IBSfKuK6QcvsAIPvW7uYYCjeMtqPmpeDv2swsPAZShc/edit#gid=0). Please note that there's a separate audit worksheet specific to the PubSec team that is shared separately for compliance reasons.

Examples: web directs. AE-created. Partner generated (for now), Opp w/no value, duplicate opp

#### AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITY

1. Auditor needs to review all notes and time stamps related to the opportunity
1. Auditor needs to log an activity #Audited on the activity record of the opportunity as mentioned below, this way we can track completion of monthly audit.
1. Ensure that relevant activity & products are attached.
1. Ensure that Products match up to Qualification info in Call Connect and/or Meeting
1. For BDRs, ensure account was in AWA status
ensuring that the [RoE](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#rules-of-engagement-quick-guide) was followed
1. Flag in the monthly [Audit Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IBSfKuK6QcvsAIPvW7uYYCjeMtqPmpeDv2swsPAZShc/edit#gid=0), any questions related to the audited opportunities.

#### AUDIT PROCESS

Each month you will be assigned one of your peers to Audit. We will share a report with all the S1 opportunities created that month. SDRs will audit SDRs and BDRs will audit BDRs. We will do our best to pair people from the same segment however it is possible that you end up auditing someone from another segment.

Once you've audited an opp, you will create a task by logging a call, choose "other" as type, and write "#Audited" in the subject line. If an opp needs more research, write "#Audited - Pending Review" and add this opp into the Audit Review spreadsheet.

[**Audit Process Video Walkthrough**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef8gFx0lR48)

#### AUDIT REVIEW (what to look for)

| Action | Rationale | Coaching Opportunity |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Opp creator    |    Our standard is to get to credited for creating opportunities that meet the qualification criteria.    |   When you set up a conversation with an AE, you should create the opportunity. If we see that an opp was created by an AE but has the SQS = Sales Dev Generated, there will need to be evidence of meaningful engagement by the Sales Dev rep prior to the opp being created.   |
| For Web Direct opportunities, check timestamp and for two way meaningful engagement prior to the purchase       | Web Direct opportunities are people that bought directly from the store themselves without necessarily having being influenced by us.       |  Explain that our role in this company is to directly influence purchasing decisions through positive and purposeful interactions with prospects. Requesting credit when we have not added specific value to a prospect's journey diminishes the credibility of our team. |
| Check to see whether opportunity qualification fields are populated. | Marketing and Sales are expected to collaborate to move prospects down the funnel based on specific qualifiers. When it comes to Stage-0 opportunities these are the opportunity qualification fields. | It's common that individuals do not fill these fields in the name of agility. This however does not create accountability in progressing these prospects down the funnel in a predictable manner. |
| Check the date of opportunity creation. | Creation of the opportunity should occur when you're engaged with the prospect and have begun the qualification process. There will sometimes be a child or related opp that needs to  be created based on needs discovered during the IQM with AE. Should that be the case, the created child/related opp should have the IQM activity as a related task on it. | Explain that creating opps as soon as engagement occurs will lead to better management of a BDRs/SDRs pipeline. |
| Check to see if there is a contact associated to the opp and that there's meaningful engagement prior to the opp being created. | Our standard process requires that we work specific leads and that we convert the main contact person to a contact/opportunity upon qualification. | Explain that this best practice will help with measuring and moving an opportunity further down the pipeline because of accurately being able to communicate the decision-making team from the prospect's side. |
| If activity shows up on the record, and the activity is a connected call with notes, verify that the activity matches in Groove. | Activities on SFDC can be edited freely and therefore questioned by our audit team. | Explain that Groove is a SSoT that can be used as irrefutable proof of outreach. Even if other systems fail, Groove is always used as the last back-up. |
| If activity matches, check that activity happened in accordance with our Actively Working Rules Of Engagement (RoE). | Team members from both Sales and Marketing are expected to contribute pipeline only within their assigned territory. | Explain that making sure that being aligned to the RoE will not create any contigencies when measuring pipeline. |

#### Typical Red Flags

1. Opportunity Source: Sales Qualified Source should be SDR generated if not validate that there is a sourcing case documented.
2. Created by: The XDR should create the opportunity, if not, there should be a written explanation
3. Did the XDR set and complete a meeting on the same day without previous activity?
4. Are there duplicate opportunities?
5. Is NetARR missing?

_Directors, Ops and JB will select random opps each month to audit and ensure audit process is being followed_

#### Best practices to ensure credit for SAO

1. Add all leads to Flows, if you're reaching out to them.
2. Make sure your activity is logged that shows how you drove the meaningful engagement that led to the opportunity.
3. Populate all qualification fields
4. If activity was a phone call or a zoom call, log notes at the time of call
5. If a meeting was set, make sure you create a stage 0 opportunity prior to the meeting, populate fields during/afterwards. If person will likely web direct, keep opp in your name and update next steps, ensure that prospect is guided to web-direct using the Flow [here](https://groove.clari.com/flows/1097006), as per the conversation [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/issues/817).
6. If engagement is in LinkedIn or Whatsapp, take a picture and attach to chatter/opp
7. If activity happened at an event, make sure that immediately following the event, you create a stage 0 opportunity and  send follow up email that recaps the conversation that took place

## Our Complementary Resources

### Best Practices for Outbound BDRs

#### Cold-Calling and Email Checklist

Our cold-calling best practices typically consist of 4 elements. A pattern interrupt, an elevator pitch and, if required, objection/trap-setting questions and Up-Front Contracts.

To be effective, these need to be customized to the individuals we call as per the logic below:

- Different Geographical Business Cultures
- Personality Type as per the DISC model
- Individual's Role and Responsibilities
- Business' Needs and Objectives

#### Call Scripts

You can find three examples of our cold call scripts in the description of the [BDR 101 Level Up Course](https://university.gitlab.com/learn/course/bdr101-outbound-cold-calling/bdr101-outbound-calls/f50b8a1c-712b-44e7-a30f-2ddbbc835ccf?client=internal-team-members&page=5)

The main documentation may be [found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3iV_WW5fRidRN5H8-3SZVAAr3ffEvjxUC6cW5SFXDM/edit) and the library of resources [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VhxVwy4DoEvFco_wXeOLb0DLtVIfo7wQ).

#### Up-Front Contract

Typically used for scheduled calls and Up-Front Contracts. UFCs can also be used as a defense mechanism when cold calling does not go as planned. For cold-calling, UFCs are used when the prospect can commit to 15' at the time of the call. If they commit to a 15' for a later time, UFCs are used to open the call and set the agenda then.

Explore the main documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7qEq8g3eHh5-oagERGvNmatiOV3JXi9Tw46SKWwpNM/edit).

#### Decision Maker Discovery

The questions below are suggestions to be used while doing a discovery call, in order to identify the decision making process, and to meet the outbound accepted SAO as per the guidelines [here.](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#criteria-for-outbound-sales-accepted-opportunity-sao)

- Who gets involved while evaluating a tool at {{company}}?
- Would you expect anyone to challenge your initiative, and if so can I help by connecting with anyonse else on your end?
- If you as a {{title}} wanted to purchase GitLab, what process internally would you have to follow, and how can we help you navigate it?
- What challenges do you expect to face when trying to pitch this change internally? Who has a say in this and what do they care about the most?

#### Email Writing Cheat Sheet

The table below shows the Command of the Message Email Writing Checklist.

It aims to outline the structure of the emails we write to prospects. Emails should be written in each person's language and tone and make sure to include the CoM frameworks as per the outline below. You can find additional resources [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-DF6bEtS9QF9idqBcK77RiLL04CKiFMuc0LDEM5N6RA/edit)

| Subject Line              |                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Personalized              | - Use Prospect's name, Company name, or colleague's name. - Relate to their situation: Use recent company initiatives, technologies they use, Projects they have planned etc. |
| Curiosity and Urgency     | - Provide an image of their future situation: Guide the reader to imagine how their situation could change. - Use compelling events to give a clear image of where they are currently. |
| CoM                       | - Proof Points: Quote Case Studies or other customers. - How We Do it Better: Make use of our defensible differentiators. |
| Opening Line              |                                                   |
| Avoid cliches             | - Stand out: Avoid losing email real-estate with cliche phrases like "just following up" or "hope all is well". - Brand yourself: Demonstrate that you have an understanding of the reader's current situation and a clear idea of his required solutions. |
| CoM                       | - Before Scenarios: Paint a clear image of their current situation and how that is causing them professional or personal pain. - After Scenarios/PBOs: Tie the current situation with a clear image of a future situation that's beneficial for the business and the individual. |
| Main Body                 |                                                   |

### Making Changes to the handbook

[Video Walkthrough of how to make changes to the GitLab Handbook for the Sales Development org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Nv7bzksiY&t=1032s)

One of our Values is being handbook first.

In order to align the SDR organization more closely to this ideal, below are suggested steps. Please remember that the Handbook is a living document, and you are strongly encouraged to make improvements and add changes. This is ESPECIALLY true when it comes to net new solutions that should be shared so the whole organization has access to that process. (aka The DevOps ideal of turning "Localized Discoveries" into "Global Knowledge".)

Steps:

- Have a change you want to make to the handbook? Great!
- Navigate to the source code of the page in the handbook (e.g. Link to edit the SDR page in the Handbook )
- Click either "Edit" or "Web IDE" to make your changes.
- Have a brief but descriptive "Commit message" (e.g. "Add new section on 'How to Make Changes to the Handbook'") and commit your changes
- Fill out the Merge Request details

### BDR Territory Movement Rules of Engagement

When a territory moves from one BDR to another but the previous BDR remains with the same team (ex: moves from one MM territory to another) the BDR vacating the territory will have the chance to temporarily retain ownership of accounts with which they have generated ongoing engagement (subject to manager approval). At the time of the holdover, an issue will be created that will be reviewed in 30 days to verify account ownership. This includes:

- The outgoing BDR will be allowed to hold back for 30 days any account with which they can demonstrate two-way engagement that could potentially lead to an IQM and new opportunity. If, after 30 days, no IQM has been set and no stage 0 opportunity exists, the account will be moved by the manager to the new BDR assigned to the territory. If the outgoing BDR is successful in generating a new opportunity, the account will remain with them until the opportunity is either qualified or unqualified.
- The outgoing BDR will be allowed to hold back for 30 days any account with which there is an existing stage 0 opportunity where they are listed as the BDR. After 30 days if the opportunity is not qualified, the account will be moved by the manager to the new BDR assigned to the territory.
- In instances where an account has been reassigned to the new BDR and the outgoing BDR had two-way engagement more than 30 days ago with the account but was unable to convert them to an SAO, and the account later returns unprompted and with no prior activity from the new BDR assigned to the territory and wants to pursue a conversation with sales, the team (manager) will receive SAO credit from any resulting opportunity.
- Any other situations that arise which result in a credit dispute will be investigated and resolved by the BDRs' leader and senior leader.

### Assigning SAO Credit when a Territory Change is Uncovered during Discovery

There will be times when an SDR or BDR is working a prospect and, after connecting with the prospect, discovers that the corresponding account actually belongs to a different segment than originally thought. This could be due to newly uncovered information regarding employee count, HQ location, or parent account relationship. SAO credit in these situations will vary based on the circumstances and will be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Specifically:

- If the SDR or BDR has done their due diligence to verify account information and still ends up finding an opportunity outside of their territory: as long as the related account isn't an AWA and there is no related activity from an SDR in the past 30 days, and the SDR or BDR's manager has verified that the accurate information could not have been uncovered prior to engaging with the prospect, then that SDR or BDR and their team will get SAO credit.
- If the related account is an AWA or there is related activity from an SDR in the past 30 days, SAO credit will belong to the BDR assigned to the AWA or the SDR working the lead related to the account.
- If the related account isn't an AWA and there is no related activity from an SDR in the past 30 days, but the SDR or BDR's manager determines that the accurate information should have been uncovered prior to engaging with the prospect, SAO credit will be assigned to the team manager assigned to the correct territory.
- Any other situations that arise which result in a credit dispute will be investigated and resolved by the SDR or BDR's leader and senior leader.

 **In situations where an SDR or BDR has received conflicting information and it is unclear what the correct territory is for an account, they should Chatter the AEs assigned to the potential territories and have them figure out who owns it.**

### Working with Resellers

The end-user account determines the BDR/SDR alignment: If you are the SDR assigned to the 3rd party lead, please gather the information in point 1 and pass the lead to the correctly assigned BDR (the BDR assigned to the end-user account) who will complete points 2-6

| Gather billing and end-user details from the reseller | - Billing company name/address: <br> - Billing company contact/email address: <br> - End-user company name/address: <br> - End-user contact/email address: |
| Create a new lead record with end-user details | - Ensure that all notes are copied over to the new LEAD as this is the LEAD that will be converted.                                                                     |
| Converting the new lead                        | - Name opp to reflect reseller involvement as shown here: "End-user account name via reseller account name" <br> - Convert original reseller lead to a contact associated with the reseller account <br> - If an account does not already exist for the reseller, create one when converting the lead to a contact <br> - Assign the record to the same account owner <br> - Do NOT create a new opportunity with this lead. |
| Attach activity to the opportunity            | - On the reseller contact, go to the activity and link each activity related to your opportunity to the opp. <br> - Activity History > click edit to the left of the activity > choose 'opportunity' from the 'related to' dropdown > find the new opportunity > save |
| Update the opportunity                         | - Change the business type to new business and stage to pending acceptance. <br> - Under contacts, add the reseller contact, role as reseller, and primary contact. <br> - Under partners, add the reseller account as VAR/Reseller |

### SDR/BDR to AE SAO Handoff Process

The purpose of the BDR-AE outbound handoff process is three fold.

- Ensure Outbound prospects get the best experience possible.
- Ensure the BDR team enjoys operational efficiencies and have clearly structured ways to collaborate with the AE team on outbound accounts.
- Ensure the AE team is set up for success is receiving outbound leads in a structured manner and have the appropriate information to utilize in converting them.

To make sure that the hand-offs maximize internal efficiencies, it is required that:

- The BDR team makes sure to book calls, with a minimum notice time of 48 business hours.
- The BDR team makes sure to properly fulfil Outbound SAO criteria, or work with AE to create a mutual command plan.
- The AE team makes sure to:
  - Accept SAOs within 8 working hours after an IQM call.
  - To leave a chatter note on the opportunity record, tagging BDR and AE manager with feedback on the level of qualification and handoff in case of discrepancies.
  - To be responsible for managing the prospect relationship after all handoff types have taken place. This includes re-scheduling conflicts.

#### 1. BDR Qualified Meeting

- Are leads that have been qualified by the BDR over a Discovery call.
- [CoM principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m5YBOCc--M1Iq5-SEEd2OUWDjYyc6VJ3xTsDEEqisUQ/edit) have been applied to the call and some of the Before/After Scenarios, Positive Business Outcomes, Requirements and Metrics have been identified and agreed upon between the prospect and the BDR.
- There is a clear need or intent identified from the side of the company, and the prospect has clearly articulated a path to the ultimate decision-maker, as per the guidelines for outbound SAO criteria.

**BDR steps after discovery call**

- Summarize CoM principles uncovered during the call
- Schedule next step through Groove while being on the call with the prospect
  - Meeting Type should be a 45' Call and the body of invitation should be adjusted to meet the prospect's needs.
- Send AE Intro Email
  - For demanding hand-offs, customer-facing agenda may also be copied and attached to intro email.
- Log Required SFDC fields and populate Notes field.
- Unless there's a scheduling conflict for the BDR, attend Evaluation Orchestration Call and kick-off the call:
  - Summarize the BDR qualifying conversation by mentioning and verifying the before and after scenario of the prospect, as transcribed on the SAO notes.
  - After prospect acknowledges that their internal situation have not changes inbetween BDR and AE call, recap the expectations and metrics as transcribed on the SAO notes and handoff to AE to move forward.

##### 2. Joint IQM

- Are meetings booked with leads that are from pre-agreed upon Actively Working Acounts.
- Calls scheduled for these prospects will be taken as a joint IQM with both BDR and AE attending, and leading the qualification.
- CoM principles will be applied during the call, with the goal of uncovering a clear need and path to the ultimate decision-maker, as per the guidelines for outbound SAO criteria.

**BDR steps before discovery call**

- Schedule next step through Groove while being on the call with the prospect, and schedule straight to the AEs calendar.
  - Meeting Type should be a 15' Discovery Call.
- Create SFDC opportunity, and log any pre-determined or relevant information from your past reseearch.
- Communicate with AE, and create a mutual command plan for the call.
  - When kicking off the call, summarize the BDR research and reason for reaching out, such compelling events, Persons with LIM, etc
  - After prospect acknowledges their compelling event and internal situation, discovery call continues with pre agreed upon structure with AE.

### Organizing a Group Demo

Organizing a shared demo makes it more simple for us to offer spontaneously a demonstration of GitLab, which should result in a easier handover of opps, and ease to create opps. As BDRs, we arranged the execution of this demo by creating a zoom webinar, and configuring the whole event so that the administrative side is automated.

| SAL/AE is involved only                                                    | The SAL can invite his/her/their customers or contacts in order to add value to their ongoing discussion, if the AE/SAL finds it relevant. This is in the context of a conversation with the prospect/customer.                                                                                              |
| SAL/AE and BDR are involved                                                | The BDR schedules a discovery meeting with the SAL (whether it is a prospect or customer) that generates a qualified opportunity. Once the opportunity is created, the SAL/BDR suggests the shared demo instead of the individual demo based on the priority of the opportunity (importance of the account, number of licenses, amount of the opportunity, persona). This is in the context of a conversation with the prospect/customer. There needs to be an opportunity in this case to suggest the demo, for the sake of collaboration between the SAL and the BDR. |
| BDR is involved only                                                       | When a lead with decision power or significant influence in the org (no individual contributor) expresses a high interest for GitLab (aka: high read/open rates on an email, response received by phone with interest confirmed) AND when the BDR has a tangible reason to think that there is a need in the division/team/company (research, information obtained through other leads in the same org), the BDR can leverage the shared demo for HOT leads to create interest or a sense of urgency, the goal being to have the lead jump on an introductory meeting after the shared demo. |
| **Define the criteria for different groups of attendees who can join this demo**                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Attendees coming from a BDR conversation                                    | In order to attend a demo, this attendee needs to be part of an opportunity in at least stage 1- Discovery.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Growth Strategies, Ranking and RoE

**Strategies:**

- Growth within an existing customer account: BDR should strategically partner with SAE/ISR to identify additional business units to bring into the conversation as growth opportunities. Renewal dates should be exploited.
- Expansion into parent/children/subsidiaries of existing customer accounts: These are accounts that fall within the corporate hierarchy within Salesforce. If a child/subsidiary account is identified via ZoomInfo but not in our system, then BDR should follow the following process: Create a LEAD for that account and then convert to CONTACT to create the ACCOUNT when you qualify your first lead.
- Free to paid upgrades: Existing Core/CE users can be targeted to upgrade to a paid version of GitLab

**Ranking and prioritization of accounts:**

- Rank 1: Expand with Purpose (EwP) accounts should be closely/strategically worked with SAEs. These accounts have High 6Sense intent scores and should therefore be High touch by BDR.
- Rank 2: ICP Ultimate parent accounts that have Core/CE-Users in a hierarchy, Total CARR/LAM for account, Med/Low 6Sense intent scores, and small renewals in current FQ.
- Rank 3: As above but are not our ICP

**Professional Services Opportunities**

A Professional Services Opportunity will be used to cover any integration, consulting, training or other service that a Sales rep will sell to a prospect/client and needs or wants to be invoiced separately. To invoice separately a new quote and opportunity must be created.

## Sales Development Tools

This page is to act as your guide to the many tools and best practices that the Sales Development Organization uitlizes.

### Claude

Claude is an AI assistant from Anthropic. It can help with analysis, content writing, research, spreadsheet organization and other tasks. 

#### Claude Sales Dev BDR/SDR User Guide

- [Prompt Library](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/issues/1231) - a place to find prompts the Sales Dev Org is currently using and collaborating on

**Limitations**

- Claude's knowledge cutoff is April 2024, so any GitLab features, pricing, or competitive details may be outdated. Always verify current information through official GitLab channels.
- Claude can't access GitLab systems, databases, or customer information directly. While Claude can analyze data you share, it can't pull anything from GitLab's internal tools or CRM. **DO NOT ADD Salesforce Data to Claude at this Time** 
- Claude can't connect to external websites, APIs, or tools. If you need Claude to review specific content, you'll need to paste it directly into the conversation.
- Claude can't maintain context between conversations - each chat starts fresh, so previous discussions about prospects or strategies won't be remembered.
- Understand that **Claude is not always right and will sound very confident even when it is wrong**

**General Tips**

- Treat it like you are having a conversation with a highly intelligent robot (ex. C3P0)
- Always try to ask follow up questions to get better answers 
- You can always have Claude write ideal prompts for you! 
- Because Claude's data cut off is from April you can upload up to date target account's 10Ks, annual reports, and investor letters for up to date research
- You can use Claude to help you reformat your spreadsheets! It is recommended to upload your data in CSV format. 

**Examples of Questions to Ask**

- "Can you see if this companies' annual report mentions DevOps, Software, Cyber Security, Git?
- “Can you make this email reply more concise?” 
- “Let's say I was a sales rep from GitLab. How should I approach this company/title?” (Can use Panos’s prompt in the prompt library as well )
- “Can you explain why you gave x answer?” 
- “Can you rewrite that in a more casual tone?”
- “I do not like that message you generated.Can you give me 3more options and explain the pros and cons of each?”

#### Claude Usage Guide

### 6Sense

6Sense is a targeting and personalization platform that we use to reach our different audiences based on intent data and our ideal customer profiles. While the content beblow is more specific to our Sales Development team, please visit the [Marketing Operation's handbook page here](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-ops-and-analytics/marketing-operations/6sense/) for a full breakdown of 6Sense's functionality.

- [6Sense Persona Identification Guide](https://6sense.com/guides/how-to-identify-and-influence-the-entire-buying-team/)

#### 6Sense 6QA Automations

We currently have in place an automation that will automatically move accounts that reach 6QA status from 6Sense to SFDC.

Specifically:

- Accounts flagged as 6QA from 6Sense, whether they already exist on our system or not, will automatically be marked with the fields:
  - `BDR Prospecting Status: Actively Working`
  - `BDR Account Strategy: Showing Intent`

- These Accounts will be flagged on 1:1 dashboards for team members to review with an expected SLA of **48 hours**  
- While these accounts are automatically switched to Actively Working to indicate the high propensity to buy, team members need to still review and accept or dispute a 6QA account.
  - For FY26Q1 we are adding a **Dispute Reason for Low LAM Dev Count** which team members can use when they opt to not pursue a 6QA account because of a small account value potential.
  - Any accounts that team members choose to dispute using the instructions below will be flagged to the Action Needed dashboards for Managers to keep track of. 
- Accepting or Disputing accounts can be done through a secondary field titled `6QA Acceptance Status` where the options `Disputed` (would need to provide reasoning) or `Accepted` can be found.
- Any accounts that marked as `Accepted` by the BDR team will trigger the [ZoomInfo workflow here](https://app.zoominfo.com/#/apps/automate/workflow/overview/678e891afc1f1f390f3b654f/completed) to automatically bring relevant decision-makers for these accounts to the [B2 view on SFDC](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#bdr-lead-views).
- This is a complementary automation for the outbound team to automatically source some prospects for you. you are still expected to properly add the account to your pipeline following the steps outlined above.

### Qualified

[Qualified](https://www.qualified.com/) is the Sales Dev Org's tool we use to chat with visitors on the GitLab website. Currently the SDR teams primarily respond to inbound chats and visitors using Qualified. The BDRs also have the ability to initiate chats with known leads from their actively working accounts.

### Gong

Refer to the [Gong](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-tools/gong/) handbook page for full details on how Gong is leveraged at GitLab.

Sales Development Org team members are provided with Gong collaborator licenses for visibility to recorded sales conversations.

SDR and BDR team members are able to leverage the `Gong Meeting` option when creating meeting invites for prospects and customers. By using this option and adding an Account Executive with Gong recorder access to the meeting invite, Gong will leverage the AE's recorder access to record the meeting, assuming all meeting participants consent to record. More details about the Gong consent page can be found in the [Gong internal handbook page](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-tools/gong/#global-privacy-compliance). Once the recording is processed, the Account Executive that was added to the invite will be listed in Gong as the host and owner of the call with the SDR or BDR as an attendee.

### Crayon Competitive Messaging Resources

[Crayon](https://app.crayon.co/intel/gitlab/battlecards/) hosts competitive messaging resources that are maintained by GitLab's product marketing team.

This is where you can find messaging related to GitLab vs some of our competiors such as GitHub, Atlassian, and Azure DevOps

### UserGems

[UserGems](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/usergems) is a tool that tracks specific cohorts of people that we provide in terms of them changing jobs. This automated tracking provides valuable insights, surfacing warm leads that can drive faster, larger wins. This tool helps mitigate deal risks when key individuals leave accounts, and accelerates deal progress when influential contacts join new organizations.

#### 1. When a person that we are tracking leaves their current place of employment

- These people are identified by the lead initial source being `UserGems Contact Tracking`
- UserGems will track that person to their new role and will automatically create a lead with their new details in our system.
- These leads will be flagged on the **Action Needed BDR dashboards** for you and your manager's review, as well as on the [B2 views](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#bdr-lead-views)
- We expect that our [standard RoE](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#rules-of-engagement-roe) will be followed normally in actioning these leads, similar to MQLs.
- These leads will be routed to the BDR team if:
  - They are associated to an Actively Worked Account
  - Are connected to a Pursuit Account, or an account that has been marked as [6QA by 6Sense](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#6sense-6qa-automations)
- The rest of the leads that do not fit these parameters will be routed round-robin to the SDR team.
- These leads should also be considered as intent data for prospecting an outbound account.
  - Take the time to research accounts for the propensity to purchase and intent signals. Could the tracked contact's hire into that account be a compelling event for you to use?
  - This data can be found either on our [1:1 Dashboards](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#dashboards-for-team-members) on report 6 that's dedicated to UserGems, or through this [lead-level SFDC template that you can clone and use.](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00OPL00000BOYrq)
  - Analyze the hiring and promotion patterns as business signals.
    - A surge in technical hires (e.g., developers, engineers) may indicate growth initiatives, product development, or a focus on scaling infrastructure.
    - Sales or customer success hires could suggest plans to expand revenue through growth or enhance customer retention strategies.
    - Senior Leadership hires may indicate an internal restructuring of a department or a new business initiative.
      - Use these hiring signals to identify potential challenges or priorities, such as team collaboration, scaling efficiently, or driving revenue growth. Based on these, target decision-makers who are likely overseeing these initiatives, like directors or VPs.
- If you'd like to iterate on any UserGems flows please follow the content creation process outlined [here.](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#flow-creation)
- We'll also notify you via Slack and email about these Job Changes.

#### 2. When a company that we are tracking gets a new hire or promotion

- These people are identified by the lead initial source being `UserGems - New Hires and Promotions`
- These people will be automatically be enrolled to a fully automated AI-driven sequence as per the guidelines below. 
- Similar to above, the same people will be flagged on dashboards and reporting for you to consider as intent signals to add their respective accounts to your pipeline.
- We expect that our [standard RoE](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#rules-of-engagement-roe) will be followed normally.`
- We are actively working to remove irrelevant prospect titles from being created as part of the `UserGems - New Hires and Promotions` lead sources. If you notice any titles that you feel should not have been created because they're irrelevant to DevOps decision-making in that company, please feel free to use the #usergems-feedback Slack channel to let us know, and we'll work with our CSM to review them. 
- In the meantime, you can also mark these leads as Status `Disqualified` and Disqualified reason `No Authority`

#### 3. When people leave or join accounts where we have open oppourtunities

- While we are actively working to improve our back-end so that this cohort can be visible on our dashboards, like the use-cases above, we are relying on sending notifications only for these people. In the meantime, you can use the report here to gauge what prospects we have on [this list](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00OPL000007z6XV). We are currently notifying:
  - The Sales team for people that joined or left a stage 3 or beyond opportunity.
  - The Sales and Sales Development teams for people that joined or left a stage 0, 1 or 2 opportunity.
- These people are not enrolled to a specific flow, since there multiple scenarios on how to best address them, please search Groove for templated messages [like this one](https://groove.clari.com/templates?fId=280305&tId=3285044) that you can use.

#### Gem-E FY26 Auto Enrollment

For FY26Q1 we will pilot auto-enrolling UG leads to a dedicated Groove Flow which will make sure of UserGem's AI functionalities. 

- Leads that have no activity, and match the filters on the [SMB report here](https://gitlab.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00OPL00000E1hpG2AR/view) or [MM/ENTG report here](https://gitlab.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00OPL00000E1bYY2AZ/view) will be automatically added to either an [SMB](https://groove.clari.com/flows/1235331?) or [MM/ENTG](https://groove.clari.com/flows/1199739?) flow. 
- These flows will automatically include AI generated customisation. Please review the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LlIjaRjwVaTI5XbWkU2fIEhhq7rYthuPGh-aaNqJz2o/edit#slide=id.g2d902c263b1_0_581) or the [video presentation here](https://www.loom.com/share/b3bc2eb774064800b8170c245434d17b) for a full walkthrough.
- These leads will be flagged on the dashboards similar to the explanation above and progress can be tracked from there.

### Sales Dev Manager Resources

#### Manager Tool Certification

We have an end-to-end process and tool walkthrough that walks manager through all the knowledge and information they need to know to be able to use our tech stack, both for inbound and outbound processes. The full walkthrough of this training is [documented on the issue here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/issues/401). Moreover, abbreviated notes of the training can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1chOoHvwk-dSsAwoloZhdGiJJoFz0yjjq07kOYmzQUvQ/edit) and a list of questions that we expect our Managers to be able to answer [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/issues/302#note_2356378893). 

#### General leadership principles

This page will serve as a training resource and operational guide for current and future managers. All Sales Development Managers should follow the [general leadership principles](/handbook/leadership/) set out in the handbook.

- [1-1s](/handbook/leadership/1-1/)
- [Providing regular feedback](/handbook/leadership/#giving-feedback)
- [Dealing with underperformance](/handbook/leadership/underperformance/)

#### Manager Onboarding

Onboarding is essential for all Sales Development Managers at GitLab. As part of onboarding, a [Becoming a GitLab Manager](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/Training/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/becoming-a-gitlab-manager.md) issue will be created for each manager when they join, or are promoted. This issue is intended to connect new managers with the crucial information they need, and ensure they have access to all the resources and training available.

#### Outbound BDR Process Manager Onboarding

The BDR process that we have defined here in GitLab is meant to provide a repeatable set of steps that an outbound BDR can follow to achieve results. It is very important for an onboarding manager to align themselves as quickly as possible to this process as it is a proven method that will help them manage their team in a efficient and data-driven way.

The BDR Process is explained step-by-step in the [section here](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#how-to-follow-our-fo-outbound-process)

For a newcoming manager, we provide the [Manager attention needed boards](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#dashboards-for-leaders) that will be your main tool in understanding where your team is aligned to our BDR process, and where they need assistance.

To help structure your usage of the above, you can follow the steps below during your first month at GitLab while [the document here will be your main go-to resource](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18k1_jDHVgNzy2SzcPZ7GAOdJ6zb9i37Z4-V1-dEFKiU/edit#)

| Action | Benefit |
| ------ | ------- |
| Clone the Action Needed Dashboard and edit each report to be exclusive to your team's names | Gives you a SSoT that you and your team can easily reference |
| Review the dashboard with your team, and discuss how the data on it connect to the [BDR KPIs](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#kpis-and-slas) | Allows you to understand your team's level of maturity and each team member's current level of alignment to existing processes |
| Take note of any discrepancies or points of feedback from the team, either transcribe them to 1:1s for individual conversations or to the SDR Issue board for org-wide improvements | Enables you to filter between discrepancies that are caused because of a team member's lack of diligence that should be improved upon by the individual OR for discrepancies that were caused by an org-wide operational shortcoming that should be improved upon on a global scale. |
| Set realistic expectations with the team about adherance to org KPIs and set a review mechanism to go over them on a reccuring basis | Helps maintain a repeatable structure of accountability for your entire team |

#### 1:1 Account and Lead Level Dashboard Coaching guidance

The table below can help with structuring how you perceive and action the 1:1 Dashboards we have on SFDC and Tableau, the below connect to the [KPI page here.](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#outbound-account-management) and the videos [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mOUGPVqhogmT0-mmqyhtiVKs4wmdHEZ_/view?usp=sharing) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L3a6-vpG562rY0u4Yve4d_y1148MIvNG/view?usp=sharing) are two quick compelementary resources to walk you through how we use the dashboards.

Additionally this [5' video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dx57o5nu9xeHsvHUOC2XYryjxYmfdHvv/view?usp=sharing) explains the purpose of these dashboards, while this [3' video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sf6vFSXb8iNaSGLGv-TtasuPS3xfz-Ni/view?usp=drive_link) walks you through a practical use case of how to use a report in these dashboards.

| Dashboard | Component | Expectation/Action | Coaching Opportunity |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1:1 Accounts Dashboard | 0. Queued Accounts | **For accounts in AW (Actively Working):** <br> These accounts are to be cleared on a weekly basis by being moved to AWA status or by leaving a clear chatter note as feedback on why the account was not added to a prospecting pipeline. This should include datapoints from intent tools or another other SSoT as supporting evidence.  | Carefully vetting and working accounts that are queued by the Sales team will lead to better collaboration, and mutual accountability. Not only are we expected to timely review these accounts but to keep our counterparts accountable to their account ranking by providing data-driven feedback. |
| 1:1 Accounts Dashboard | 1. Review Existing Pipeline | **For accounts in AW:** <br> These accounts are currently in the team member's name. The total volume should not be over 125 for Mid-Market BDRs and 75 for Enterprise BDRs. As a priority these should be reviewed weekly and action should be taken accordingly to remove or update these accounts. |  When clicking into the report the team member can screen all the datapoints that can help them gauge the status of their accounts at a glance. Activity and Research fields can be combined with intent datapoints to quickly see which accounts should be reviewed further manually. |
| 1:1 Accounts Dashboard | 2. Research Accounts to be Recycled | **For accounts in AW:** <br> These reports are nearing their automated recycle date, which by default is two months after their actively started work date. This report acts as a fallback report to the report above. A BDR should have already reviewed these accounts as part of their actively working account screen done in the previous step. This report will act as a second reminder. | In theory an outbound account will have received at least 30 days worth of outreach since most flows we use have at least a 30 day cadence. It's fine to leave an account in a team member's pipeline until it's removed automatically in hopes of getting some inbound MQLs assigned to the BDR. Regardless, there's a business decision to be made about whether expecting inbound MQLs is a sound strategy, based on the team members quota attainment and overall pipeline at the moment, and whether replacing the about to be expired for another account is a better route. |
| 1:1 Accounts Dashboard | 3. Re-evaluate newly added flagged accounts | **For accounts in AW:** <br> These accounts were recently added to a team member's pipeline but at least one of our intent tools flags it as a weak account in terms of intent data. | In the spirit of hyper-targeted results, this account should be empty since all tools we have should agree that this account is good enough to be added to the team member's pipeline. If there are any accounts flagged it is wise to review them and ensure that they should indeed remain with the team member's pipeline. |
| 1:1 Account Dashboard | 4. Check past opportunities for potential use | **For accounts not in AW:** <br> These are past opportunities that could be reviewed for re-engagement. | Closed: Lost opportunity re-engagement is one of the best converting sources of pipeline for our team. After having reviewed the pressing reports in the first three steps above, the quickest review to make to gauge some low-hanging fruit is this report. |
| 1:1 Account Dashboard | 5, 6 and 7. Assess high priority individuals | **For accounts not in AW:** <br> These three reports show individuals that connect to actively working accounts in the team member's pipeline. These should be reviewed and any relevant next steps or actions should be made on the account-level bdr notes. | These three reports show individuals with high intent data, engagement in marketing campaigns or recent with interesting moments. While it's not necessary that there has to be action on the specific individuals, their behavior can give significant queues into the current situation within an account. |
| 1:1 Account Dashboard | 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Review High Intent Accounts. |**For accounts not in AWA:** <br> These reports split not-AWA accounts in a few different buckets. While there will be significant overlap, having multiple reports help prioritize how a team member can review their account list for new accounts to add to their pipeline. These reports should be reviewed weekly and the majority of AWA accounts should be sourced from one of these. | These reports all reference our intent based tools, existing RoE around pursuit accounts and should guide the decision-making of team members. Referencing these as a first step should create a lot of internal efficiencies in researching accounts. |
| 1:1 Account Dashboard | 13. Consider AE-ranked accounts. | **For accounts not in AWA:** <br> This report visualises accounts as per the ranking that the sales team manually gave them. They should be reviewed after the team member has reviewed intent-based tools. | The Sales team does not have access to the same data as us so their manual research can be used a good fallback report to cross-reference against the reports in the previous steps. |
| 1:1 Account Dashboard | 14 and 15. Review individuals from not actively worked accounts | **For accounts not in AWA:** <br> These reports show individuals from non-actively worked accounts that either have been part of a marketing campaign, or show strong intent signals. | These individuals should be approcah as an indication that the account as a whole should be investigated for outbounding. |
| 1:1 Account Dashboard | 16. Review individuals in flight. | **For accounts not in AWA:** <br> This report shows a breakdown of prospects currently on a Groove Flow. Should be reviewed for any further actions to be taken. | Consider whether adding more individuals to a flow for a particular account might make sense, or whether the individuals from the top prospect accounts should be getting additional outreach outside of the flow steps. |
| 1:1 Account Dashboard | 17. Consider past Actively Worked Accounts. | **For accounts not in AWA:** <br> As a final check, this report should accounts that were previously outbounded for the territory, do any of them make sense in terms of re-engagement? | Outbound efforts typically take a long time to convert an account, and reviewing new intent data is a great practice to maintaing a good re-engagememt pipeline. |
| Tableau Dashboard | Inbound Interest Dashboard | This dashboard is an intuitive way for BDRs to manually screen their database. It should be used as a complementary resource to the account-level dashboards above. | While the account-level dashboards are pre-made, and there to guide the thinking of team members in terms of account research, this Tableau dashboard allows a team member more flexibility into sorting through the database. They can use the filters to replicate the permutations of the account level reports in any way that they please. |
| Tableau Self-Dashboard | Self-Managed Instances Dashboard | This dashboard allows BDRs to track and manage instances that are self-deployed by prospects or clients. | It helps BDRs understand how self-managed instances are performing and identify any potential opportunities to convert them into fully managed accounts or upsell additional services. |
| Tableau Self-Dashboard | Self-Managed Instances Dashboard | This dashboard allows BDRs to track and manage instances that are self-deployed by prospects or clients. | It helps BDRs understand how self-managed instances are performing and identify any potential opportunities to convert them into fully managed accounts or upsell additional services. |
| Prospect 360 | Prospect 360 Dashboard | [This dashboard](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/enterprise-data/data-catalog/customer-intelligence/#prospect-360) consolidates data from key systems like Salesforce, 6Sense, Qualified, and Marketo, providing BDRs and SDRs with a starting point for account-level prospecting. It can sort-listed to identify accounts that| By offering a holistic view of account activities, including engagement history and lead/contact interactions, it helps teams identify and prioritize high-potential accounts for conversion.

### Field Marketing <> BDR Collaboration Process

Our FM/BDR collaboration process is a method that we follow in the spirit of maximizing cross-functional collaboration. We have created an issue template for Field Marketers to populate, which in turns gets managed from the [Kanban Board here.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/boards/5665082) The premise of the [issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/FM_BDR_Collaboration_Template.md) and board is to streamline communication between our teams. The issue template very clearly articulates all next steps required of this process while it also tries to leave space for us much AdHoc collaboration as required for each specific event.

As a BDR Director you will be tagged first in this issue as the primary DRI, while as a BDR Manager you will be involved in this issue on a case-by-case basis by your regional Director. All next steps of this process are clearly mentioned in the template for the issue so please follow each step in turn. The Sales Dev Operations team is also tagged and will be there to monitor progress and offer help if requested.

### Status Related 6Sense Reports

On folder #5 in the [6Sense segments list](https://gitlab.abm.6sense.com/segments/manage), you'll find the templates for the main three categories of accounts that we have. These templates are meant to be cloned and edited for your teams as per the guidelines below and will assist with coaching on 1:1s and team calls, as well as driving more predictable pipeline building.

**[Currently Actively Working Accounts Template](https://gitlab.abm.6sense.com/segments/segment/495284/accounts/?mode=edit&segment_type=6sense_network)**

- This report will cross-reference your team's currently AWAs against 6Sense intent data, and will highlight the best ICP accounts currently on your team's pipeline.

**[CE/SFDC Accounts not in Actively Working Status](https://gitlab.abm.6sense.com/segments/segment/495296/accounts/?mode=edit&segment_type=6sense_network)**

- This report will highlight the best ICP accounts on our existing database, that are not actively being pursued by your team.

**[Greenfield Accounts not in Actively Workin](https://gitlab.abm.6sense.com/segments/segment/495295/accounts/?mode=edit&segment_type=6sense_network)**

- This report will highlight the best ICP accounts that are NOt currently on our existing database. Please note that due to the complexity of our sales territories, there may be edits required on filter #8 (Address). There are multiple variants for City, Country or Region that can be used to accurately display each team's territory. Please feel free to reach out to the Ops team to help you determine these and generate the best reports possible.

### Sales Dev Territory and Role Reports

**[Sales Dev by Salesforce Profile and Role -](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008gonx)**

- Sales Dev Ops profile is the only profile with the ability to help add a member to opps beyond stage 0 (we can't add SDR/BDR to closed won opps however)
- Certain roles have certain permissions ie. Team Lead roles are able to transfer leads. Director level roles are able to help when account assignments are incorrect by updating account address and employee size information.
- Roles determine visibility based on the region (AMER, APAC, EMEA). Example: a BDR with EMEA in their role, will be able to see all accounts where the account territory owner has EMEA in their territory role name.

**[Sales Dev Territories by Team role/member associated with each territory -](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008gpBL)**

- This allows you to see what members/roles are associated with each territory. When you need a change in BDR assignment to a territory, please sharethe territory name with Sales Dev Ops, not the name of the account. Search for the account owner name and tell Sales Dev Ops which territory/territories require that BDR to be assigned.

### New Account AE Reports

- Use [this report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008gmAA) to figure out the territory name for the account you are working. Use command F to find the zip/state/country and figure out correct territory name.
- Then use [this report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008glPn) by plugging in the territory name to figure out who the correct AE is
- Please make sure you have all the correct location information on the lead you converting to initially create this new account.

### Onboarding

GitLab People Connect Team members will [create the onboarding issue](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/people-operations/people-connect/onboarding_process/#timing) and start completing the onboarding tasks, no later than one week before the new team member joins. People Connect Team members require a minimum of 4 business days (with the new hire timezone as the basis) before the new hire's start date to complete all onboarding tasks. This issue will be automatically assigned to you. As a manager, you will [also have tasks](/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/#managers-of-new-team-members) that need to be completed prior to the new team member's start date.

The general onboarding issue will also automatically add a ['Sales Development' section](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/employment-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding_tasks/department_sales_development.md) under 'Job Specific Tasks' based on the role of the new SDR. Both you and your new hire will have tasks to complete in this section.

With the creation of this issue, an [access request (AR) will also be automatically created](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/role_baseline_access_request_tasks/department_sales_development) for a new team member on their second day at GitLab. This AR lists the role based entitlements (pre-defined groups and system-level access that are granted automatically to team members depending on their role) your new hire will need.
     *See what is being auto provisioned on this AR [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/role_baseline_access_request_tasks/department_demand_generation).

#### New Hire's First Day

On your new hire's first day, the assigned People Connect Team member will [schedule a welcome email](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/people-operations/people-connect/onboarding_process/#day-1-onboarding-tasks) to arrive at 7:30am (local time of the new team member) on their start date detailing how your new hire can access GitLab and begin their onboarding process.

#### Manager Onboarding Checklist

##### Prior to Day 1

- Complete 'Manager' tasks on the onboarding issue *Note: there are tasks to complete prior to your new hire starting
- Schedule a welcome call at the start of your new hire's first day to discuss:
  - Main focus should be completing as much of your onboarding as possible.
  - When you have available time feel free to move ahead as some onboarding task lists for the day won't take you all day.
  - How to manage meeting invites in your inbox (there are a ton!)
  - You will receive numerous emails in their first two weeks asking you to register or activate your license to a specific tool we use, please go ahead and do all of this.
  - What you can expect in regards to [onboarding at GitLab as an SDR](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#sales-development-onboarding)

##### After new hire has started

- Complete remaining 'Manager' tasks on the onboarding issue
- Set up [1:1s](/handbook/leadership/1-1/)

### Career Mobility Issues

A career mobility issue should be opened 2 weeks before the transition date by the people connect team. If the aligned manager does not see that issue created 2 days before the scheduled transition date, the manager should reach out to the People Connect Team via the [#people-connect Slack Channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02360SQQFR).

**People connect opens mobility issue if any of the following are true:**

1. If there is a change in department.  Ex. SDR/BDR moves to the SMB Sales Team
2. Someone changes from Individual Contributor to Manager
3. Someone changes from Individual Contributor to Team Lead
4. Someone Changes from Manager to Individual Contributor
5. Someone Changes Teams

### Flow Creation

- We follow the process outlined [here](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#new-groove-flow-creation) for creating new content, when it comes to reviewing this content, the Sales Dev Ops team will follow a quarterly cadence of reviewing the Flows/campaigns that are on the In-flight column on the board [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sales-development/-/boards/5540104). We use the criteria below:

**1. Flow needs to be a globally applicable**

- Only Flows that could be used by any team member globally can be added to the Good Collection.
- If a regionalized Flows can be translated to English, then the English copy of it will be added to the GC while the local variant will be added to the Team Collection.
- Field Marketing event Flows and any other similar type will not be considered for the Good Collection.

**2. Flows needs to have completed the requirements set out on the issue descrption**

- At least 200 people enrolled and/or having completed the Flows on a timely manner.
- ( Flows has over 5% reply rate AND No less than 50% negative sentiment rate. ) OR Flows has over 5% meeting set rate.

#### Things to look out for when reviewing a Flow as a Manager

- Does the messaging of the Flows follow Command Of the Message?
  - Are all emails formatted appropriately with pain-probing questions and value propositions?
  - Are the relevant value drivers for the personas targeted by this Flows used?
- Is there a proper mix of automated and manual touches?
  - Are 1-2 highly personalized emails used for High-Touch Flows?
  - Are there at least 4 call steps for High-Touch Flows?
  - For Low-Touch/Awareness campaigns are all touchpoints automated?
- Are proper Groove elements used?
  - Are automated variables used all on all emails?
  - Are manual personalisation variables used on manual emails?
- Is the purpose of the Flowsclearly articulated on the issue description?
  - Are there other Flows that are proven to work that could be used instead?
  - Is there a valid reason for this campaign? Will it contribute to results in terms of SAOs or awareness?
  - Is the target demographic clearly thought out?

### Sales Development Onboarding

As BDRs and SDRs, you work closely with the larger marketing org as well as the sales team. Due to this, your onboarding will encompass training on tools and processes related to not only your role but a blend of marketing and sales.

This learning experience involves virtual self-paced learning paths in the form of a general company-wide onboarding issue, a Sales Development specific issue, as well as a Google Classroom course to prep you for [Sales Quick Start (SQS)](/handbook/sales/onboarding/sqs-workshop/). SQS is a 3-day in-person immersive and hands-on workshop for all new hires in a sales development or sales role. In parallel, you will meet regularly with your manager, onboarding buddy and members of our sales development enablement team to chat through and dig a bit deeper into the topics within your onboarding.

The goal in all of this is to ensure that you feel confident and comfortable to hit the ground running at the start of your second month on the job when you will have a [ramped quota](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#bdrsdr-quota-for-months-0-4-and-compensation). Our hope is that along this journey you are not only gaining the tactical skills needed to complete your job, but that you form connections with colleagues, gain a strong understanding of our culture, and begin to develop industry knowledge.

### Sales Development Onboarding Process

1. The People Team initiates a general GitLab onboarding issue for every new GitLab team member. On your first day, you will receive a welcome email with a link to your specific onboarding issue and steps to get started. You will also meet with your manager to discuss:
    - Access to your sales development specific issue
    - Prioritizing your onboarding issues
    - How to manage calendar invites in your inbox on Day 1
1. Within 3 days of starting at GitLab, you will receive an email giving you access to [Command of the Message (CoM)](/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/) e-learning materials. CoM is our value-driven conversation framework that will be covered during SQS.
1. During your second week, the Sales Enablement Team will send you a calendar invite for the upcoming SQS as well as an email prompting you to log in to Google Classroom to begin working through the [Sales Quick Start learning path](/handbook/sales/onboarding/sales-learning-path/). Connect with your manager to arrange travel for SQS or if you are unable to attend the next session.
1. Within a week of attending SQS, you will receive access to the 13-week Command of the Message Fast Start program.
1. In your first few weeks you will receive access to your Sales Development Technical Development training. This is to be completed within your first 180 days and ties directly to SDR [progression](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#graduating-from-sales-development-onboarding).

### Graduating from Sales Development Onboarding

- Complete GitLab general onboarding issue
- Complete BDR/SDR specific onboarding issue
- Complete Google Classroom SQS prep work
- Attend the SQS workshop
- Complete the 13-week Command of the Message Fast Start program

### BDR/SDR Quota for Months 0-4 and Compensation

For BDRs and SDRs joining on the first Monday of the month

- Month 1 = 25% quota
- Month 2 = 50% quota
- Month 3 = 75% quota
- Month 4 = 100% quota

For BDRs and SDRs joining GitLab on the 15th or after of the month

- Month 0 = no quota
- Month 1 = 25% quota
- Month 2 = 50% quota
- Month 3 = 75% quota
- Month 4 = 100% quota

Quota and compensation will be assigned by the BDR/SDR Manager and discussed in the first 1:1. If a fully ramped BDR/SDR transfers BDR/SDR teams they will have a 50% ramp for month 1 and 100% quota for month 2.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and Rules of Engagement (RoE)

### Rules Of Engagement (RoE)

1. Is the lead connecting to accounts from the Financial Services (AMER) or Telecommunications (EMEA) industries?

    **No:** Please proceed to the next step.
    **Yes:** Normal RoE rules are superceded, and the lead is worked by the respective Telco/Finserv BDRs, not the SDR team <br> 

2. Is the MQL from an Existing Account?

    **No:** It is worked by the SDR team <br>
    **Yes:** Check the BDR Prospecting Status and Account Type

3. Is the Account a customer?

    **No:** Move on to the next step
    **Yes:** Check for Opportunities

4. Is there an existing renewal opportunity?

    **No:** Move on to the next step
    **Yes:** Align with the sales [RoE for renewals](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/go-to-market/rules-of-engagement/#crediting--splits) and check whether the lead is involved in an upcoming renewal, check in with the Account Executive and your Regional Manager to determine what's the best course of action for this person.

5. Is the Account in "Actively Working" Status

    **No:** It is worked by the SDR team <br>
    **Yes:** Check for Activity

6. Does the account have activity placed by the BDR in the last 30 days?

    **Yes:** It is worked by the BDR Assigned. <br>
    **No:** Check to see if there are leads related to the account that have activity using [this report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008RfvU)
    When you modify this report based on company name and email domain, do you see any activity in the last 30 days? <br>
    **Yes:** It is worked by the BDR Assigned <br>
    **No:** It is worked by the SDR Team.

    **Next Steps:** SDR chatters the BDR Assigned and lets them know you didn't find activity and will go ahead and Flow the lead. FYI's the BDR Manager. BDR Manager will work with the BDR to put the account into the correct BDR Prospecting status. If a BDR is able to relay information that was not picked up in the SDR's research, the SDR should end the Flow if the prospect hasn't engaged and change lead ownership to BDR so the BDR can reach out. If the SDR has engaged with the prospect, there will need to be a coordinated handoff worked out between SDR and BDR. Note: Only activity logged in SFDC will be recognized as activity.

7. Is the Account in "Queued" Status?

    **Yes:** It is worked by the SDR team

8. Is the Account in "Worked in FY" Status?

    **Yes:** It is worked by the SDR team

9. Is the Account in "Restricted" Status?

    **Yes:** It should be routed to the BDR assigned. The BDR assigned will chatter the SAE about whether they'd like them to reach out or whether they would like to own that responsibility. The AE should respond within 48 hours.

    - If they reply back that the BDR can work, the BDR will continue with the prospect as a lead record and take action.

    - If they reply back that they want to be responsible, the BDR will convert the lead so that it becomes a contact.

    After determining an MQL is to be worked by the SDR team:

10. Is the new MQL related to an existing MQL that is part of the same account?

    **No:** The MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin

    **Yes:** Check the status of the existing MQL

11. Is the existing MQL in Accepted or Qualifying status?

    **No:** The MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin

    **Yes:** Check the activity on the existing MQL

12. Is there activity in the last 30 days or a follow up task scheduled for the future?

    **Yes:** The MQL should be worked by the owner of the existing MQL

    **No:** The MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin. If you are not sure, double-check with the related SDR.

13. Is the lead automatically generated from UseGems as evident from the `Initial Source` field?

    **Yes:** If it's an SMB lead it's worked by the inbound team, if it's a MM/ENTG lead it's passed to the BDR associated with the territory regardless of the rest of the RoE. BDR is expected to follow the outbound actively worked account process as per usual.

If the related SDR relays information that was not picked up in the new SDR's research, the new SDR should end any active Groove Flow if the prospect hasn't engaged and change lead ownership to the team member who has been engaged so they can reach out. If the new SDR has engaged with the prospect, there will need to be a coordinated handoff worked out between the new SDR and the related SDR. Note: Only activity logged in SFDC will be recognized as activity.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### General Sales Dev Trouble-shooting

**Q:** I can't see certain Groove collections!: <Br>
**A:** You potentially were added to the incorrect Sales Dev Team in Groove. Please reach out to Sales Dev Operations.

**Q:** My version of Salesforce seems very basic…: <br>
**A:** Make sure you are using the Sales version of Salesforce. To check, please go to the top right corner of your Salesforce window and click the blue button with the drop down window. From there select "Sales".

**Q:** I have not received access to all of my tools and it has been a week. <br>
**A:** Notify your manager and have them comment on your Onboarding Role Entitlements Issue.

**Q:** I have uploaded more leads from ZoomInfo than what are showing up in my Salesforce ZoomInfo Lead View. <br>
**A:** This most likely due to these leads aleady being in our Salesforce. The problem is that they are listed as a contact in Salesforce and will only appear in your ZoomInfo Contacts view rather than your Zoominfo Lead view.

**Q:** I do not know what this person did to score as an MQL. <br>
**A:** First check the last interesting moment description on Salesforce and then check the Scoring tab of the Marketo Sales Insight widget that is also on the Salesforce lead page. If no points were allocated to behavior and only to demographic type information please Slack the Marketing Ops group so they are aware that this lead did not take any new action.

**Q:** I received a personal data subject request by a prospect. <Br>
**A:** Our MOPs team has set up a process to address any data subject requests for deletion or access to data. If you receive a request for deletion or access to data, please re-direct inquiries to the [Personal Data Subject Request](https://support.gitlab.io/personal-data-request/).

**Q:** Why are BDRs no longer the Account Owner in SFDC? <br>
**A:** BDRs are no longer listed as the account Owner in SFDC to improve Sales Dev and Sales visibility across all prospects/accounts (excluding PubSec). If you want to filter to see just your accounts, please use the 'BDR Assigned' field.

**Q:** A prospect said they were going to buy through our website (known as a Web Direct). How can I tell if they did? <br>
**A:** SDRs get credit for opportunities where the SDR had meaningful two way communication with a prospect 60 days before they bought GitLab through our website. The best way to search for a web direct opportunity is to use [this report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004dkX4). First, set the date range to the time you think the prospect would have bought. Next, find the opportunity that is tied to your prospect's account. Then follow the process to request SAO credit.
**Note: Sometimes someone else from your prospect's company actually made the GitLab purchase, leading to the opportunity being related to them instead.**

**Q:** How do I request credit for a web direct opportunity? <br>
**A:** On the opportunity record in Salesforce, compose a new Chatter message that includes the following:

1. Tag a member of the Operations Team (Ramona Elliott or Ed Bao) or the Director of Global Commercial Sales Development (Brian Tabbert). **Do not tag Sales Support Yourself**
2. Include a link to the record in Salesforce that shows your related two-way activity in the past 60 days. If your related activity is a phone call, you must have entered the details of the phone call into the Qualification Notes field on the lead record at the time of the call in order for it to be considered. Qualification Notes entered after the Web Direct opportunity has been created will not be considered for credit.
3. Explain how you influenced their decision to purchase GitLab (helped with evaluation, uncovered a need, provided value, etc)
The Operations team and/or Director will review the information and decide whether SAO credit is warranted. If confirmed, they will Chatter Sales Support to add you to the opportunity. If rejected, they will communicate to you the reasoning for their decision.

#### RoE Common Questions

**Q:** Should BDRs flag duplicate accounts? <br>
**A:** Yes. However, they do not have the ability to merge it themselves so should chatter @Sales Support to do it.

**Q:** How do we resolve a dispute over SAO credit?<br>
**A:** SDR and BDR first try to talk through a solution If no agreement: Managers will determine a solution If no agreement between the managers: Escalate to Senior Leadership Double credit nor double compensation will be given

**Q:** Who will be handling inquiries from an SDR/BDR standpoint? <br>
**A:** Inquiries will go to an open queue. SDR's will not work them. We want to give marketing time to progress these to MQLs. <br>
**A:** BDR's can work leads in all statuses if they are related to their "Actively working" accounts. Outreach to these leads would be part of their account strategy.

**Q:** What if a prospect comes back directly to the BDR much delayed, when the account is not marked as "Actively Working" anymore, but resulting from personalized messaging? <br>
**A:** Yes, if they email, reply via LI, or call the BDR directly, the BDR will need to check that the lead is in queue ownership. If so, they must move the account back to "Actively Working", so that the lead can be put into their ownership.

**Q:** Why are my leads being reassigned to Inquiry Queue? <br>
**A:** Marketing Operations has a daily scheduled clean at 10:30 PM EST/EDT that update Status = Inquiry to Inquiry Queue. To prevent the reassignment, you'll want to update the leads from Inquiry to Accepted or add to an Groove Flow.

**Q:** What should BDRs do when a prospect or contact responds with a complince related question or objects to being contacted? <br>
**A:** Immediately reach out to the Privacy Team via #privacy-team-help and forward any email from the contact to dpo@gitlab.com.

**Q:** How do I know if a lead is associated to a Partner Account and is being worked by a Partner?
**A:** Partner leads will not be asigned to BDRs or SDRs as they will be assigned to the Partner Queue. To tell whether a lead is associated to a Partner Account, check their `Vartopia Partner Account` - if it's empty, you are may proceed with outreach.

**Q:** When a partner lead is assigned to Partner, when and how can we recall the lead?
**A:** Partner lead will be recalled after a certain period of time if they are not accepted by Partners for joint marketing campaigns. They will be initially be recalled with a Recycle status, once they become MQL, they will be assigned to BDRs or SDRs. For more information on this process, see the [Vartopia handbook page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/vartopia/#partner-recall).

### Sales Dev Performance Management Process

The Sales Development organization believes in getting the job done (consistently delivering results) and doing it right (meeting KPI/SLAs, adhering to [Our Three Pillars](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars), and being good partners both internally and externally). Our performance management process is deeply rooted in this philosophy. As we are building high-performing teams, it is important to understand that while we expect results, we also have expectations surrounding how we get to those results. Therefore, a performance management process will be initiated if a team member is not meeting their performance targets and/or is not adhering to their KPIs/SLAs. The idea behind our framework is to address issues promptly to ensure the long-lasting success of all team members.

The sections below will provide more details as to the performance management process on quota attainment as well as [Our Three Pillars](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars) and KPIs/SLAs for inbound leads and outbound account management. While regular coaching is expected in weekly 1:1s, informal performance management will be initiated if a ramped team member has two consecutive months below 75-80%* attainment (SAOs, Stage 1 XDR Net ARR or Stage 3 Net ARR).

_*Range due to varied quotas_

#### SAOs and Stage 1 XDR Net ARR

Once the team member is informed, expectations will be:

- Month 1: 75-80% attainment + adherence to [Our Three Pillars](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars)
- Month 2: 75-90% attainment + adherence to [Our Three Pillars](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars)
- Month 3 and beyond: 100% attainment + adherence to [Our Three Pillars](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars)

Should the team member fall short of the targets above, a formal warning will be issued.
After the formal warning is issued if the team member falls short of targets again, additional disciplinary action could be taken up to and including termination.

#### Stage 3 Net ARR

As a business we understand that Stage 3 Net ARR is a metric that can take time to influence. We are viewing Stage 3 Net ARR attainment as an indicator of healthy pipeline generation. Two consecutive months below monthly quota attainment suggests potential issues. Stage 3 Net ARR is a direct consequence of Stage 1 Net ARR. Therefore, performance management will focus on what can be immediately influenced by a team member: Stage 1 Net ARR (not Stage 1 XDR Net ARR stamped amounts, but real opportunity value: Stage 1 Net ARR).

The process, however, will
 stay the same: once the team member is informed, expectations will be:

- Month 1: 80% attainment + adherence to [Our Three Pillars](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars)
- Month 2: 90% attainment + adherence to [Our Three Pillars](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars)
- Month 3 and beyond: 100% attainment + adherence to [Our Three Pillars](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#our-three-pillars)

Effective in FY26, Net ARR generated from a Focus Account New Logo (First Order or New Connected) will be counted twice toward this attainment.

Should the team member fall short of the targets above, a formal warning will be issued.
After a  formal warning is issued if the team member falls short of targets again, additional disciplinary action could be taken up to and including termination.

The official tracking of SLA times is done on SFDC, but you will also find an 'Acknowledge' button on the Slack notification that you can press so that it helps with daily check-ins with your Manager.

### PTO and Flexible Working

#### Sales Development Organization Time Off

In accordance with the [Time Off Policy](/handbook/people-group/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off), you need give your manager a heads up early of your intended time off so that they can help arrange cover for your tasks, if necessary.

We want to help our team members being able to fully unplug from work during their PTO, while not having to worry about their workload or target attainment. Based on this, we have created this PTO Territory Planning Issue that you can use to strategize your work and be aligned to the GitLab value of being a [Manager of One.](/handbook/leadership/#managers-of-one)

To log a PTO Territory Planning request, please go to the Issue list on the SDR GitLab project [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sdr/-/issues/new#) and choose `PTO_Coverage_Template` from the Description drop-down list. All of these requests are then managed through the board here. and all next steps and guidelines are on the issue description.

#### Flexible working

At GitLab we have flexible working hours. This means that you can organize your working day as you like and are not expected to arrive and leave at a set time every day, but we do expect MQL's to be followed up within 1 hour (during business hours) so communication with your manager will be necessary if you plan to be out for an extended period of time. Managers will provide direction on the routing of leads during that time.

With a prospect-facing role in Sales Development, do keep in mind when you are calling and emailing prospects:

- The best times to call are early and late in the business day, so these may be best blocked for this activity.
- Groove allows you to schedule emails at set times. For outbound prospecting, the most effective emails are those that come in the early morning and early evening, so you can take advantage of this feature. On the other hand, inbound MQL's must be handled regularly throughout your day as they come in.
- Lunchtimes are good for outreach as most prospects have meeting blocks for three hours in the morning and then two hours mid-afternoon.
- The above blocks you can use for account research and planning, customer meetings, or meetings with your sales reps, manager, peers, and teams.
- Although you are not expected to start work and end work at the same time every day, please do keep in mind the normal business hours of your prospects, and make sure to schedule your own working hours to ensure you maximize opportunities.

In short, working at GitLab means that if you start the day early you can take a long lunch break to hit the gym or go grocery shopping in the middle of the day when it's quiet, yet you can still do a full day's work around that and don't need to be accountable all the time, as long as you are available to call prospects and be available for prospect meetings during normal working hours for your region/territory.
