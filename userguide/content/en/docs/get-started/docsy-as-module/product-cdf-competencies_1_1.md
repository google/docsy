On this page, you'll find an overview as well as links to helpful resources for evaluating a product manager's performance at GitLab. To better understand a product manager's responsiblities at GitLab, please visit [The Product Manager Role at GitLab](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/)

## Product Management Career Development Framework

<kbd class="required">Required ðŸ”Ž</kbd><br>
<br>
We track progress through the skills required to be a product manager at all levels via the Product Management Career Development Framework (CDF). The single source of truth for that framework is the table below but you can use this [CDF template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MT_Xks-oF-D-2R_N380h4Phg_9s7BbO0U8k0eP-u8EI/edit) to track your career development with your manager. We are transitioning the CDF to include the company-wide standard of evaluating performance per the [Performance/Growth Matrix](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#the-performancepotential-matrix). In this model, performance will be considered in categories of Developing, Performing, and Exceeding, alongside evaluation of Developing, Growing, and Exceeding in [Growth Output](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#growth-output) instead of using Growing, Learning, Thriving, and Expert categories of the [compa-ratio](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#compa-ratio).

### What is the expected outcome of a CDF Review?

CDF reviews should result in actionable improvement focus areas for the product manager. When conducting a CDF review, managers should consider drilling into specific items within the PM's purview to highlight where the team member can focus on improving. [PM competencies](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/learning-and-development) are also valuable for identifying improvement areas.

We use KPIs by function in the CDF. These KPIs feature a guideline for results that are meant to be suggested indicators for ideal behaviors for Product teammates at GitLab. These are target results and are not meant to be an exhaustive list for Product teammate performance. As a manager and individual contributor, have a dialogue about the right measures of success and define those at the beginning of each performance cycle. Keep the KPIs consistent as you measure them over each CDF review for the best comparative results of growth.

### Selecting a Focus Area

In each CDF review, it's recommended to select an improvement area to focus on until the next CDF review. This could be anywhere from 1 to 3 improvement areas that you and your manager select together. Once selected, the teammate and manager check in on those focus areas in each 1:1 reviewing progress, discussing feedback, and adjusting any plans for the quarter to continue to improve. Selecting a focus provides a structure to say "no" to other areas that may not be as timely, critical, or worth the additional focus.

## CDF for Individual Contributor Product Managers

### Competencies

Product Managers must be able to demonstrate a variety of skills across our CDF. We provide additional career development guidance by listing [competencies](/handbook/people-group/competencies/) for each CDF category in order of priority.

## Evaluating Product Manager's potential

When evaluating a product manager's potential, in addition to the [generic information](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#what-is-potential) outlined, we also want to evaluate potential based on the unique and outsized impact PMs can have. We acknowledge that the evaluation will remain more qualitative than quantitative, but rather than shy away from making an evaluation, we will lean in using the information below.

We can think about the Product Manager's potential primarily on two axis: value creation and leadership.

### Value Creation

Product managers are in the business of creating value, measurable by [Product KPIs](/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#structure). They prioritize the most important thing to unlock the most value at the intersection of the business and the user or buyer. At GitLab, Product Managers are often the [business owner](https://www.svpg.com/product-managers-vs-business-owners/) of their segment and outputs are not just in the delivery of features to production, rather can include go-to-market, sales enablement, partner/channel/alliances relationships, and understanding revenue impact of the product offering.

We expect product managers to create value across the business by excelling at execution in at least the following levels. When thinking of a PM's potentials, consider their capacity to expand their influence beyond their current level.

| **Level**        | **Value created at..** |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| **PM**           | features and categories |
| **Senior PM**    | features, categories and stage |
| **Principal PM** | features, categories, stage, and cross-stage |
| **GPM**          | stage and cross-stage |
| **Director**     | cross-stage, cross-department |
| **VP and up**    | company-wide or new business/industry |

### Leadership

As product managers grow in experience and seniority, they are tasked with shaping alignment, producing results, and leading with increasing responsibilities. Understanding how to set the tone with vision and strategy, and knowing how to control output in a system comprised of people, culture, technology, and process is how product managers lead.

We expect product managers to be a leader at the following levels. When evaluating potential, consider the PM's capacity to be a leader with more scope.

| **Level**                  | **Leadership level** |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **PM**                     | product group |
| **Senior PM/Principal PM** | product group, stage, and cross-group alignment |
| **GPM/Director**           | multiple groups and stages |
| **Senior Director**        | cross-department |
| **VP**                     | company-wide |

### A framework for evaluating potential

It can be challenging objectively evaluating product managers for categorization of Low, Medium and High potential as suggested in the [Performance/Potential Matrix](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#the-performancepotential-matrix). Consider using the following framework to rank a PM's potential. Assign a ranking, 1 (Low) - 5 (High) to each attribute below. Add up the rankings for a total score. A score between 5-11 is low potential, 12-18 is medium potential, 19-25 is high potential.

| Attribute                 | Reasoning |
| ------------------------- | --------- |
| Self-motivation and drive | The intrinsic drive enables PMs to learn, be passionate, and ultimately be effective. |
| Influence                 | High potential PMs build rapport with their team, which supports accomplishing results. |
| Resourcefulness           | PMs should seek to learn and grow. What they learn is ultimately meaningful if the learning can be applied. |
| Ambitious                 | High potential PMs stretch themselves and make themselves available to new responsibility. |
| Self-awareness            | A large part of leadership is knowing where you are not strong and building relationships to fill in the gaps. |

#### Make evaluating potential actionable

Product managers are typically driven and high performing individuals, and we often overestimate our own abilities relative to others. Seeing even a medium potential may be disappointing to many PMs. It should be made clear that a perceived lower than desired potential does not mean the PM is not valued and not performing to expectation. Managers should use a CDF Review to discuss the scoring of the potential. The outcome should be to identify opportunities for the PM to grow and areas for the manager to mentor and coach the PM.

## Supporting a Product Manager's Career

We want Product Managers to succeed in their careers at GitLab and beyond. Product Managers are encouraged to fill out and talk to their managers about their longer-term career goals either as part of their CDF reviews or as a separate career coaching discussion. To help facilitate, track and make time for overall career growth, Product Managers can fill out this specific template for career coaching conversations in the main [CDF template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MT_Xks-oF-D-2R_N380h4Phg_9s7BbO0U8k0eP-u8EI/edit#heading=h.6wqbupmuee9o). Having all career development and progression in one document will help both Product Managers and their Managers keep track of progress.

### Typical Requirements for Promotions

 Promotions follow the [standard promotion process](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#twice-per-year-promotion-calibration-process--timeline) and adhere to the [promotion philosophy](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#promotion-philosophy). When reviewing a proposed promotion, we consider: 1) readiness of the individual, and 2) business justification/opportunity. Team members should already be demonstrating some of the next level job frameworks levels before promotion and a [promotion document](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#promotion-document) should be completed. For promotions to take effect, the budget needs to be available and approved. If there is not a business need substantial enough to justify a promotion opportunity, it is possible that otherwise qualified individuals may not be able to be promoted until an opportunity becomes available.

 Unless there is a justifiable exception, the requirements below are also typically required to be met for individual contributor promotions within the Product department:

| **Levels**                      | Intermediate | Senior | Principal | Senior Principal |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------ | --------- | ---------------- |
| **Typical Business Need**       | A Group requires PM support and the manager has bandwidth to support an Intermediate PM. | A Group requires PM support including deeper strategic direction and cross-group coordination within the Stage. | A Stage requires extensive PM support, strategic leadership, and cross-stage coordination within the Section. | The company requires broad PM support, strategic leadership, and cross-section coordination. |
| **Typical Reporting Structure** | Reports to a Group Manager or Director | Reports to a Group Manager or Director | Reports to a Group Manager, Director, or Senior Director | Reports to a Senior Director, or VP |
