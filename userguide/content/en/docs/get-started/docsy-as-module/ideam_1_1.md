### IDEAM's Forest Definition

- An area with tree coverage greater than or equal to 30% of the ground and trees with a minimum height of 5 meters.
- A minimum area of 1 hectare (10,000 mÂ²).
- Differences from other definitions:
  - Aligns with FAO and IPCC definitions but may differ from specific national criteria or other platforms like Global Forest Watch, which uses adjustable tree cover definitions.
  - Does not distinguish between forest types (primary, secondary, intervened), requiring additional analysis for specific ecological impacts.
- Colombia's adopted forest definition is: _"Land primarily occupied by trees that may contain shrubs, palms, bamboo, herbs, and lianas, where tree coverage predominates with a minimum canopy density of 30%, a minimum canopy height (in situ) of 5 meters at the time of identification, and a minimum area of 1.0 ha. Tree coverage from commercial forest plantations, palm crops, and trees planted for agricultural production are excluded. This definition is consistent with the criteria defined by the UNFCCC in its decision 11/CP.7, with the definition adopted by Colombia under the Kyoto Protocol (Ministry of Environment, Housing and Territorial Development, 2002), as well as with the definition of natural forest coverage used for the estimation and reporting of the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (INGEI), and included in Colombia's adaptation of the CORINE Land Cover Colombia (CLC) methodology legend."_ Although the document that standardizes how IDEAM calculates these deforestation metrics and forest detection does not explicitly mention the types of forests that meet these criteria, it implicitly covers natural forests that meet the thresholds for tree coverage, height, and area. This includes tropical rainforests, dry forests, montane forests, and other natural forest ecosystems and excludes the aforementioned coverages.

### IDEAM's Deforestation Definition

- Deforestation is considered the total and permanent loss of forest coverage in a determined area.
- **Exclusions:**
  - Does not include temporary forest losses, such as those caused by natural phenomena or forest regeneration.
  - Does not differentiate between causes of deforestation (e.g., legal logging, illegal logging, fires, agricultural expansion, infrastructure).

### Data Resolution and Accuracy

- Standard resolution: Based on Landsat images (30m) and in some cases Sentinel-2.
- **Possible limitations:**
  - There may be underestimation of small deforested areas (less than 1 hectare) that are not detected by the sensor resolution.
  - Errors in areas with high cloud cover, especially in the Amazon, can generate false positives or negatives in the detection of coverage changes.

### Data Temporality and Updates

- Annual monitoring: IDEAM publishes deforestation maps with approximately one year lag.
- Early warnings: Generates quarterly alerts, but they require validation before use in official or regulatory studies.
