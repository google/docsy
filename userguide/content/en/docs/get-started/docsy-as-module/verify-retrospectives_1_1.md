The team uses a monthly async retrospective process as a way to celebrate success and look for ways to improve. The process for these retrospectives aligns with the [automated retrospective process](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/async-retrospectives#how-it-works) used by many teams at GitLab.

A new retrospective issue is created on the 27th of each month, and remains open until the 26th of the following month. Team members are encouraged to add comments to that issue throughout the month as things arise as a way to capture topics as they happen.

On the 16th of each month a summary of the milestone will be added to the issue and the team will be notified to add any additional comments to the issue.

As comments are added to the issue, team members are encourage to upvote any comments they feel are important to callout, and to add any additional discussion points as comments to the original thread.

Around the 26th of the month, or after the discussions have wrapped up the backend engineering manager will summarize the retrospective and create issues for any follow up action items that need to be addressed. They will also redact any personal information, customer names, or any other notes the team would like to keep private. Once that has been completed the issue will be made non-confidential and closed.
