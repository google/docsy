## Overview

The Support team doesn't have the ability to opt the customer out of [Services Usage Data](/handbook/legal/privacy/customer-product-usage-information/) and the customer cannot opt-out of the feature without Sales team approval as mentioned in [the handbook](/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/). To handle this request, you can

1. Find the Account owner on SFDC
1. Use the Zendesk Macro `Support::Self-Managed::Super Sonics Opt Out` and fill in the account information
