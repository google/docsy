## Role

Product Managers at GitLab have a unique opportunity to define the future of the
entire [DevOps lifecycle](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/). We
are working on a [single application](/handbook/product/single-application) that
allows developers to invent, create, and deploy modern applications.

We want to facilitate [Concurrent DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/concurrent-devops/) so that teams can work simultaneously instead of sequentially, unleashing collaboration across organizations.

We work in a very unique way at GitLab, where flexibility and independence meet
a high paced, pragmatic way of working. And everything we do is [in the open](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).

We are looking for talented product managers that are excited by the idea to
contribute to our vision. We know there are a million things we can and want to
implement in GitLab. Be the one making decisions.

We recommend looking at our [about page](/handbook/company/) and at the [product handbook](/handbook/product/)
to get started.

## Core PM Responsibilities

As a product manager at GitLab, you are primarily responsible for:

1. Understanding the problem of our users and customers (Sensing Mechanisms)
1. Defining requirements for a solution that is loved by our users and customers (Product Roadmap & PLG)
1. Establish plans for your team to realize commericial viability from the product (Aligning Teams with Values)
1. Communicating and enabling adoption of your product area and the entire platform (Thought Leadership)

In addition, as a PM, you also play a critical role in the regular development and operating cadence of GitLab. There are a few specific required tasks that the PMs are directly responsible:

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Maintain and update [Direction pages](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#devops-stages) | Direction pages communicate our [vision](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/) and plan externally and internally. |
| Review PIs and update [PI pages](/handbook/product/performance-indicators/) | Product Indicators are how we know whether or not we are making the right investments or measuring the right thing. PMs should be intimately knowledgeable with the PIs in their domain. |
| Release planning for every milestone | PMs are the DRIs for planning and [prioritizing](/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization-ahead-of-kickoff) the work for their respective development group. Some of the output for release planning can be planning issues and [kick-off](/handbook/product/product-processes/#kickoff-meetings) videos. |
| Create [release post content](/handbook/product/product-processes/#release-posts) | The release post is the way to broadcast what features have been released. PMs are responsible to ensure release post item MRs are created, reviews are complete and posted. |
| Drive alignment with stable counterparts via [OKRs](/handbook/product/product-processes/#objectives-and-key-results-okrs) | PMs play a role in facilitating alignment by ensuring individual functional groups' objectives are appropriately prioritized within their development group. |
| Connect user and customer insights with [product prioritization](/handbook/product/product-processes/#issues-important-to-customers) | Customer interviewing, collecting insights about customer adoption, pain points, and reprioritizing "What's Next". PMs are responsible for continuously refining the most important feature, bugs, and tech debt to ensure relevance to the market, install base, and expansion. |
| [Triage new issues](/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization) (features, bugs, security vulnerabilities, etc) | PMs [share responsibility](/handbook/product/product-processes#prioritization-for-feature-maintenance-and-bugs) for prioritizing the most important issues based on [work type](/handbook/engineering/metrics/#work-type-classification). |
| Determine [pricing tier for features](/handbook/company/pricing/) | [The CEO is responsible for pricing, but PMs are responsible for determining which plan features belong to.](/handbook/company/pricing/#departments) |

### How does a PM ensure they are solving a problem for our users?

PMs should spend a significant amount of time understanding the problems our users face. Deeply understanding the problem is the foundation for all other activities PMs take on; understanding the problem enables the PM to define the vision and prioritize effectively.

In order for a PM to deeply understand the problems our users are facing and determine which are the important problems to solve, they can do the following:

- Have a deep knowledge of each category's problem space
- Regularly talk with users and customers
- Enagage with analysts in the market
- Regularly complete competitive analysis
- Communicate with users on issues and epics
- Work with Pre-Sales and Post-Sales to connect with customers and prospects
- Uncover insights through UX Research
- Use other [sensing mechanisms](/handbook/product/product-processes/#sensing-mechanisms). It is through user interactions that we can begin to understand what problems our users are facing and identify how we could make product improvements to help eliminate the pain points. These user interactions can present themselves in many different ways.

### How does a PM ensure we build lovable products?

Producing a lovable product requires more than a deep understanding of the problem. At GitLab, we build lovable products by adhering to our [values](/handbook/values/). PMs are expected to be the ambassador of the GitLab values by:

- Focusing on [results](/handbook/values/#results).
- Embracing [iteration](/handbook/values/#iteration). This is the secret to GitLab moving fast, as we get constant feedback and maintain forward momentum toward GitLab's huge [vision](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#vision). PMs play a large role in unlocking iteration as a competency.
- Being [transparent](/handbook/values/#transparency). This will enable both our development group to contribute and just as important, enable the wider GitLab community to contribute.
- Being [efficient](/handbook/values/#efficiency). PMs should advocate for the boring solution, optimize for the right group, be the manager of one, always write things down, so they can help their groups also be efficient.
- Being [collaborative](/handbook/values/#collaboration). PMs ultimately don't ship anything on their own. PMs need to be a great teammate so that the development group can produce great work.
- Being someone who helps make GitLab a work place of [diversity, inclusion, and belonging](/handbook/values/#diversity-inclusion), so that everyone can come to GitLab and do their best work.

### How does a PM ensure business viability for our product?

It is not sufficient to just know the problems. It is also insufficient to have a solution to the problem that our customers love. PMs also need to ensure that the solution is viable for GitLab.

- PMs participate in and follow the [product development flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/) so that their development group can consistently release features [every month](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/).
- PMs [determine the tiers of features](/handbook/company/pricing/)
- PMs ensure that issues that impact GitLab are appropriately [prioritized](/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization)
- PMs interface with marketing and sales to promote and enable the sale of the product.

### Moving to and moving from

The career paths to and from product management positions are varied, but there are some common patterns.

### Moving to Product Management

Successful product managers have a passion for solving problems. As a result they've
been found to start their journey to product management from the following disciplines:

- **Engineering**: Engineers understand deeply how the product is built and how they work. A desire to understand the user problem of their product
and to further influence product direction can lead engineers to pursue Product Management roles.
- **UX**: Product Designers and UX leaders have built a great understanding of the personas and pain points their product
targets. A desire to further influence not just the experience but the way the features alleviate those
pain points can draw UX professionals to Product Management.
- **Engineering Manager**: Engineering team leaders who've gained a strong understanding of the customer persona, pain
points and direction of a product often want to further influence that direction by transitioning to Product Management roles.
- **QA/QE**: Quality engineers are responsible for the validation of a product and service. Those who
have a passion for understanding and testing how products are used in the real world by real users often
find a strong alignment to the Product Management function.
- **Product Marketing**: Product Marketers with a desire to have more influence in shaping the product often
migrate to the Product Management function.
- **Customer Success**: Customer facing functions like Solutions Architects, Customer Success Managers, and
lead Support techs who've developed a strong understanding of customers' needs in the product often transition
to Product Management out of a desire to shape the direction of the product.

### Moving from Product Management

Within their role, Product Managers are empowered to interact and learn more about functions they are interested in.
Whether that be Marketing, Customer Success, Support, Finance or Engineering - Product Managers are encouraged (and often
required) to understand other functions as part of their daily responsibilities. As such there is plenty of room for
Product Managers to transition to roles outside of the Product Management team. Some of those include:

- **Engineering Leadership**: Product Managers often find a desire to dive deeper into Engineering problems, or grow
mentor and lead engineering teams.
- **Product Marketing**: Product Managers often gravitate to how we target, message and deliver value to our customers.
Product Marketing roles are an excellent way to further that expertise.
- **Customer Success**: Few people know our products as well as Product Managers, and product managers who enjoy directly
solving customers problems on a daily basis make great fits for Customer Success roles.
- **General Management**: As a result of their exposure to a wide variety of functions, Product Managers often make a
transition from Product Management to General Management.
