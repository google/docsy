[Unsupported block type: image]
Thank you for visiting! The purpose of this resource is to provide GitLab team members with information on how legal assists and supports with the procurement of products and services at GitLab.
For information on the GitLab Procurement Team, policies and process, visit [The Procurement Handbook Page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/).
For general questions that ***do not*** require legal advice, deliverables, or any discussion of confidential information, you can reach out to the GitLab Legal Team in slack at [`*#legal*`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/legal) or the GitLab Procurement Team in slack at [`*#procurement*`](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/procurement).
## Contacting Legal
You don’t need to reach out to GitLab Legal directly. The GitLab Legal Team will be engaged directly by the Procurement Team, as applicable.
## When is Legal involved
GitLab Legal will review any and all purchases made to ensure adequate legal terms are present for GitLab to ensure alignment with GitLab’s risk standards. Examples of types of purchases include, but are not limited to:
- Software Agreements;
- Professional Services Agreements;
- Sponsorship Agreements;
- Event Contract;
- Hotel Contracts; and
- Subcontracting Agreements (staff augmentation or providing services/resources to GitLab and/or GitLab customers)*.
- Note: Additional policies regarding some purchases may apply. Please ensure that you work with the GitLab Procurement Team to ensure that your purchase is in compliance with policies and process. For more information, please visit [The Procurement Handbook Page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/).
## Signing Contracts
**DO NOT SIGN ANY CONTRACTS**
- Only authorized individuals can execute contracts on behalf of GitLab. Please view the [Signatory Matrix](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/authorization-matrix/) for who may sign.
- In order to be executed, all Contracts must include the GitLab Legal stamp. This stamp confirms that the Contract has been reviewed and approved by a Legal Team Member. If you do not receive a GitLab Legal stamped version of the Contract, please ask the Procurement Team Member for assistance.
- If you accidentally sign a contract or become aware of a contract that was signed by someone without authority, please immediately report it to the GitLab Procurement Team so that GitLab Legal can be engaged.
## Vendor Requirements
- All vendors must agree to comply and act in accordance with:

## NDA Process
- Prior to exchanging any confidential information, GitLab and a potential Vendor should execute a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement. This will ensure the adequate protection of any / all information shared.
- Follow the [Non-Disclosure Agreement process](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/nda/) to send an NDA via DocuSign or request one if you do not have DocuSign access.
- NOTE: GitLab should push to have the vendor accept or use GitLab’s template as the purchasing party. If a potential vendor requires the use of their NDA template after seeking use of the GitLab template, please follow the process located on the [Procurement Page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/) which will initiate the legal review process.
## Negotiating Terms
- For any purchases made by GitLab, there must be executed terms and conditions in place before a purchase can be made or before services can be provided.
- Making a purchase and/or receiving services without executed terms and conditions in place is prohibited by GitLab procurement policies and could expose GitLab to substantial and unintended risk.
- In the event a vendor is providing services which include accessing, processing or controlling GitLab data, the GitLab Legal team may require the vendor to provide the list of sub-processors relevant to the services provided to GitLab. In addition, based on the data made available to the vendor, a DPA may be required, which will be engaged by the Privacy team.
- For more information regarding purchase requests, GitLab Templates and our negotiation thresholds, please visit the [Procurement Handbook Page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/).
