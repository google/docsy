## Product Design Manager Pairs

Product Design Manager pairs give PDMs a regular touchpoint with their peers and additional exposure to other product areas outside their own.

- New pairs are connected every six months.
- A PDM who is a manager of managers should not be paired with one of their direct reports.
- If we have an odd number of people, we'll have one 3-person partnership.
- Pairs decide what to share and when; there is no predefined schedule or guidelines.

### Collaboration suggestions

- Share team processes and ways of working.
- Walk your pair through your product areas to familiarize them with it.
- Talk through ongoing and upcoming work happening in your area. This can uncover opportunities for cross-stage collaboration.
- Discuss strengths and skillsets on your teams to connect product designers looking to grow in certain areas with product designers who are already strong in those areas.

### Schedule

This is the rotation schedule for FY26-Q2 and Q3 (2025-05-01 until 2025-10-31).
