title: Boundary Breakers
---

`Boundary Breakers` is the first Engagement Concierge program at GitLab. It's a pilot program with people managers on the Commerical Sales team, led by Ryan O'Nell.

## Purpose

Boundary Breakers will help the commerical sales team build team connectedness. Participants will focus on growth as individuals, but also as a team.

With Boundary Breakers, we hope to lower the barrier of entry to personal development for participants, offering selected material that's focused on common team goals.

## Goals

1. Maintain the connection with the ASMs to continue to build a more collaborative culture
1. Uplevel management skills and share best practices
1. Building a cohesive team to navigate the uncertainty of a difficult market

## Structure

### Part 1: In Person Workshop

Boundary Breakers will start with a 1.5 hour workshop during the team offsite, led by People Busiess Partner Lauren Tepper. The workshop will utilize the CliftonStrengths assessment and focus on identifying strengths and making them work for participants and their teams.

### Part 2: 8 Week Learning Program

Following the workshop, participants will begin an 8 week program including:

1. Weekly Level Up Course: ~45 to 55 minutes per week in a self paced course including videos, articles, and discussion threads.
1. Weekly Team Discussion: 25 minute team discussion
