title: Package Stage - The most important use cases for our customers
---

## Overview

The goal of this page is to create, share and iterate on the Jobs to be Done (JTBD) and their corresponding job statements for the Package stage. Our goal is to utilize the JTBD framework to better understand our buyers' and users' needs.

## Goals

Utilize JTBD and job statements to:

- Understand our users' motivations.
- Validate identified use cases and solutions.
- Continuously test and iterate features to ensure we are meeting our customers' and users' needs.
- Create a transparent view for our stakeholders into the current and future state of the product.

## Challenges

- Most customers do not purchase GitLab solely for the Package stage. So, there will be assumptions in the JTBD that from the buyer's perspective, the motivations for 'buying' Package are the same.
