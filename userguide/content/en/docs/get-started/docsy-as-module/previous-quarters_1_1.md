### FY22 Q4 Product OKR Process

**Below is our Q4 iteration on the OKR process.** This Q4 process/timeline incorporates [FY22 Q3 OKR pilot learnings](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/2714). To address some of the findings, we're introducing **Shared R&D OKRs** to clarify and highlight Objectives aligned upon by the CProdO and the CTO. The Shared R&D OKRs will then serve as the priority across the Product and Engineering teams.

- Quarterly priority OKRs from CTO and CprodO will be referred to as **Shared R&D OKRs**
- The teams responsible for collaborating on these OKRs will be referred to as [**Product Groups**](/handbook/product/product-processes/#quad--infra--security-product-group-dris)

For guidance about the Product OKR process, team members can post in Slack #product and tag [Product Operations](/handbook/company/team/#fseifoddini). Team members can also attend [Product Operations office hours](/handbook/product/product-processes/#product-operations-office-hours-bi-weekly) for live support. For guidance on how to use Ally.io please check out Ally.io resources or post in Slack #ally-okr-rollout and tag Product Operations.
