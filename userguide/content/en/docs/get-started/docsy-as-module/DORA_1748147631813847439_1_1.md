### How GitLab addresses the key contractual requirements of the Digital Operational Resilience Act

## Important Notice

The information in this summary is intended as an overview and outline of certain [Digital Operational Resilience Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R2554&from=FR) ("DORA") related matters. Its purpose is to inform and raise awareness amongst GitLab's current and prospective customers who fall under the DORA regulation. This DORA Mapping does not provide legal advice and shall not be construed or used as such, nor does this document form part of, create or amend any agreement, representations, warranties or any other obligation between GitLab and its customers. Customers must seek and rely only on independent legal advice on any DORA related matter and customers acknowledge that they remain solely responsible for complying with their legal and regulatory requirements. GitLab shall have no liability arising from any errors, misstatements or omissions in the content of this DORA Mapping document.

## Regulatory Context

The Digital Operational Resilience Act was created to harmonise security and resilience practices across Financial Entities ("FEs") operating in the European Union, and requires that all financial market participants, including stakeholders in the financial sector, which so far have not been subject to extensive ICT security regulation (credit institutions, payment institutions, account information service providers, electronic money institutions, investment firms, insurance companies, crypto-asset service providers, exchanges and clearing houses, alternative fund managers, pension, credit rating agencies, etc) can maintain resilient operations through severe operational disruption caused by cyber security and information and communication technology (ICT) issues. DORA does not override any existing cyber security regulations applicable to the financial sector (such as NIS-2, EBA etc), it exists alongside those. While GitLab has not historically been considered an outsourcing partner under the [EBA Guidelines](https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/internal-governance/guidelines-outsourcing), DORA doesn't just apply to outsourcing arrangements, but to the use of all "ICT Services", casting a much broader net amongst information technology providers. Accordingly, GitLab wishes to help our customers better understand how they may comply with their DORA requirement in the context of their use of GitLab's DevSecOps platform. DORA officially came into effect on the 16th of January, 2023 and its provisions apply and are enforceable from the 17th of January, 2025 following the implementation period.

## GitLab's Approach

This DORA Mapping document aims at assisting financial services customers that fall under the rules of DORA to navigate the use of GitLab's Software in relation to the various considerations introduced by DORA. With this document we'd like to make it easier for our financial sector customer to gather the necessary information for their own regulatory compliance. In the below table, you will find a list of requirements under DORA, alongside the references to the relevant information and GitLab policies.

GitLab's contractual framework relevant for DORA compliance purposes, consists of a number of components, which may include the following:

- [**GitLab Subscription Agreement**](/handbook/legal/subscription-agreement/) ("GLSA") (or similar document entered into by the parties) includes the terms and conditions applicable to the use of GitLab's Software;

- [**Data Processing Addendum**](/handbook/legal/data-processing-agreement/) ("DPA") is incorporated into and forms integral part of the GLSA and sets out the data processing rules between the parties;

- **Order Form** -- includes the specific products/services purchased, pricing and any other specific commercial terms and conditions applicable;

- **Statement of Work ("SOW")** -- if Professional Services are purchased, the SOW includes the description and method of delivery of such services, as well as the assumption and specific obligations of the parties etc. our Professional Services team will work with you to discuss and determine your needs and requirements.

- [**Service Specific / Additional Terms**](https://about.gitlab.com/terms/) -- depending on the products/services purchased, Additional Terms may apply, such as the AI Terms, Agile Planning, Professional Services Addendum etc; if you are considering [GitLab Dedicated](https://about.gitlab.com/dedicated/), our Sales team will be happy to assist you with any specific terms or provisions.

- **Financial Services Addendum** -- includes additional terms to address specific regulatory requirements applicable to our financial sector customers. Please contact your Account Executive if this regulatory addendum is relevant for your organisation.

All of the above listed documents are referenced in this DORA Mapping document where relevant. Further to the information included in the below informative chart, Gitlab had also engaged a reputable third party firm specialising in IT compliance attestation to perform a DORA related review and assessment of GitLab's Dedicated services - the summary of this report is available to view on [GitLab's Trust Center](https://trust.gitlab.com/).

The information in this document was current as of January 2025.

| DORA Requirements and considerations | DORA reference | GitLab's comment |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-contractual due-diligence and general principles** | | |
| **1. The principle of proportionality and the assessment of risks and dependencies.** The FEs management of ICT third-party risk shall be implemented in light of the principle of proportionality, taking into account: (i) the nature, scale, complexity and importance of ICT-related dependencies, (ii) the risks arising from contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services concluded with ICT third-party service providers, taking into account the criticality or importance of the respective service, process or function, and the potential impact on the continuity and availability of financial services and activities, at individual and at group level. | Art. 28 (1) b) | GitLab will assist our new or existing financial sector customers in assessing the nature of the services we provide, in the context of our products and the customer's chosen deployment method. In general, GitLab's DevSecOps platform is not expected to have a direct impact on the continuity and availability of GitLab's customers' ability to deliver financial services to their customers. Please contact your Account Executive with any risk or impact assessment related questions and queries. |
| **2. Information Security Standards.** Financial entities may only enter into contractual arrangements with ICT third-party service providers that comply with appropriate information security standards. | Art. 28 (5) | At GitLab, we're committed to Information Security as detailed in our [Security Vision and Mission](/handbook/security/). We created the [GitLab Trust Center](https://trust.gitlab.com/), powered by [SafeBase](http://safebase.io/), which allows us to maintain a single, unified location for communicating our compliance and assurance credentials, hosting our security and privacy documentation for customer consumption, sharing important notices such as responses to third-party breaches, and hosting our internal knowledge base where customers can readily access the same answers we provide in questionnaire responses. The GitLab Trust Center includes a portal for both GitLab.com and GitLab Dedicated. |
| **3. Access, audit and inspection.** In exercising access, inspection and audit rights over ICT third-party service providers, financial entities must, on the basis of a "risk-based approach", pre-determine the frequency of audits and inspections over third-party service providers and the areas to be audited. Where the ICT services entail high technical complexity, firms must ensure that they verify that the relevant auditors possess appropriate skills and knowledge to effectively perform the audits and assessments. | Art. 28 (6) | Our customers may carry out ongoing remote self-serve assessments via [GitLab's Trust Center](https://trust.gitlab.com/), a portal providing access to industry-standard documentation, including various certifications issued against widely recognised relevant professional standards by independent third-party auditors against the objectives stated in ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, SOC 2 Type 2 (or equivalent standards) and other reports and documentation attesting Gitlab's policies, procedures and security measures. By signing up to the notification function of GitLab's Trust Center, customers will receive relevant notifications of future or updated versions of the certifications and other collateral. |
| **4. Termination rights.** Financial entities must ensure that the contracts they have in place for the use of ICT services may be terminated in a list of circumstances detailed by the referenced article. | Art. 28 (7) a)--d) | GitLab's FSA addresses these regulatory termination rights. Please contact your Account Executive if this regulatory addendum is relevant for your organisation. |
