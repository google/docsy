This page is in [draft]({{< ref "values#everything-is-in-draft" >}}). We are working to build out this page and gather all the running initiatives/partnerships in Engineering.

At GitLab, Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging is infused into our company culture, from our [values]({{< ref "values" >}}) to our [all-remote way of working]({{< ref "all-remote" >}}).
Engineering partners closely with our [Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging]({{< ref "inclusion" >}}) team to ensure weâ€™re building a diverse and inclusive workforce around the globe as the company continues to grow. This page provides an overview of DIB Engineering Initiatives:
