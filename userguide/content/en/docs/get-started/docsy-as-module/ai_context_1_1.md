title: "AI Context Taskforce"
---

## Vision

The AI Context Framework Task Force aims to create a robust and scalable system for storing, managing, and utilizing additional context across all AI features within GitLab. We envision a framework that enhances the intelligence and effectiveness of our AI-powered tools by leveraging project-specific information, ultimately leading to more accurate and tailored AI responses for our users.

## Mission

Our mission is to develop a comprehensive context framework that will:

- Standardize the storage and retrieval of contextual information
- Improve the quality and relevance of AI-generated outputs across GitLab features
- Provide transparency and control to users regarding the context used in AI interactions
- Enable easy integration of new context sources as GitLab evolves

## Core Responsibilities

1. Design and implement a standardized architecture for storing and retrieving additional context, collaborating with the Global Search team to leverage their ongoing work with storing embeddings
1. Define and document available context types and their appropriate use cases
1. Establish a process for contributing new context sources to the framework
1. Integrate the context framework with existing AI features (Chat, Code Suggestions, Workflow)
1. Develop user-facing controls and transparency features for context management
1. Collaborate with other teams to ensure the framework meets diverse AI feature needs

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. Adoption rate of the context framework across AI features
1. Improvement in AI response quality (measured through user feedback and automated metrics)
