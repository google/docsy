## Why I'm at GitLab

1. **Our Product** GitLab is a leading all-in-one DevSecOps platform, empowering organizations to thrive in a $40B market by providing end-to-end solutions and driving innovation in a world where software is foundational to every business.
1. **Our Company** I thrive in high-growth environments, where I can help transform a fast-moving, dynamic organization into a well-structured, enterprise-scale powerhouse. Driving order, building scalability, and enabling sustainable success is where I excel. Additionally, our global all-remote culture embodies the future of work. GitLab is a true case study that proves remote work isn’t just possible—it’s a competitive advantage. I’m inspired to be part of a journey where every contribution builds to something bigger, better, and impactful.

## My Personal Values

1. **Results** - Focusing on results means prioritizing achievement with meaningful outcomes.
1. **Accountability** - Your word is your bond and honor it consistently.
1. **Progress** - Strive to be better than the day before. Applies to me personally, to my team, processes, platforms while continuously learning, improving and growing.

## My Super Powers - how you can get the best from me

1. **Execution** -  I like to see things come to fruition. Let’s get the job done.
1. **Adaptable** - To sustain growth and drive efficiency, we must continuously evolve our systems and operations to scale. I believe change is the one constant and I help bring order to chaos.
1. **Builder** - Building high-performing teams and creating an environment where personal strengths and diversity of thought contribute to team excellence. Additionally, build solutions by creating a comprehensive strategy that aligns technology with business objectives.

## My Weaknesses

1. **Privacy** - We are more than our job. I am also very conscious that everyone is likely fighting a battle we know nothing about. I typically won’t engage or will keep it light on personal conversations unless asked or told.
    - How to help me manage this: If you need help, please ask for it. I will always support you to the best of my ability.
1. **Brevity** - I am visual and prefer short, bulleted, thoughtful and concise messages. I also think it demonstrates consideration for everyone’s time and attention for both the Writer and Reader.
    - How to help me manage this: Feel free to ask me to elaborate or deliver the message in a format that works for you.
1. **Focused** - I am in a role where I have to navigate a web of complexities around people, processes and platforms to solve problems, remove blockers and take decisive action. It leaves little room for ambiguity. The shortest path is to ask pointed questions eliminating unnecessary fluff, being clear about the situation and expectations; this encourages everyone to take responsibility about what needs to be done.
    - How to help me manage this: Feel free to suggest better approaches to drive clarity. I’m always on the look out for new techniques.

## My Expectations of Everyone

1. **Honesty** - I always appreciate direct communication and find it the best way to learn and address any situation.
1. **Individual Initiative** - I trust team members are highly skilled in their respective roles (calibrated by career stage); are self starters and have expertise in what they do.
1. **Team Work & Collaboration** - I believe we are only as strong as the weakest link. If everyone brings their best, delivers high-quality work, and is transparent of the constraints, this collectively drives individual, team and organizational success.
1. **Context & Understanding** - I recognize that workplace interactions are complex, and complete situational awareness is not always possible. When a request is declined/delayed, it should be understood as a strategic prioritization - what’s best for GitLab, not a personal rejection.

## My Role

1. Drive and align business objectives and delivery value through technology. Advancing our technology ecosystem is a continuous evolution of strategic refinement, aligning our digital capabilities where technology and organizational culture grow together. 
1. My team's vision is to: Be a trusted business partner providing world-class solutions and value. By providing a stable, secure, compliant, simple and highly integrated solutions ecosystem to empower business with technology and services that enables productivity to fuel GitLab growth.

## Communication Preferences

1. I am responsive on all mediums: Slack, Google Workspace, Meetings, Email and Phone (Emergencies).  I will always do my best to acknowledge all inquiries or delegate to someone on my team to provide responses within 24 hours. 
1. If you have any questions, please reach out to me or schedule a coffee chat. Please contact Anita Mall (EBA) for assistance with scheduling.
