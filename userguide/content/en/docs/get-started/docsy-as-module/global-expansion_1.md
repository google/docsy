## Austria

- Contact: gx_employeeexperience@globalexpansion.com
- [Platform Instruction Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l68UexMJxglZ1dkcqbeGRdjf9Ym8sxVl/view)

All benefits listed below are administered and managed by [Global Expansion](https://www.globalexpansion.com/countrypedia/austria)

The Austrian Social Security Act General Social Insurance Act (Allgemeines Sozialversicherungsgesetz, ASVG) has employer and team member contributions to cover statutory requirements such as pension, health insurance, accident insurance and unemployment.

### Medical

Austria can access the public Austrian health insurance system. This health insurance scheme covers all the team members and their family members.

Team members have the option to select GX’s global medical insurance plan through AXA at their own cost via **salary deduction**.

Review the [AXA Benefit guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EW0J9S3kEnNxOk9UpoHhNL4EKVUdfPIZ/view).

- The AXA plan will be administered directly through GX.
- During the onboarding of a *new hire*, GX will collect the team member and eligible dependent’s census for enrollment via the GX1 platform.
- GX will then email the cost of the medical insurance plan directly to the team member to confirm whether they would like to opt in or not.
- Once the plan is implemented, the team member will receive the documentation along with a digital pass via a secure link directly from AXA.
- For any addition or modification a team member can reach out to the GX team at: gx_employeeexperience@globalexpansion.com.

### Pension

GitLab does not plan to offer pension benefits at this time as Austria has their uniform pension system through The Act on the Harmonisation of Austrian Pension Systems. The amount of a pension is calculated on the basis of the duration of the pension insurance and amount of the contributions paid. In order to receive the pension a team member must have paid contributions for at least 180 months (15 years).

### Life Insurance

There is no plan to offer life insurance at this time as team members can access the benefits via the social security system which covers illness, injury & disability.

### Bike Leasing Benefit

Global Expansion, through partnership with the local provider, is able to offer a bike leasing option to team members via [BikeLeasing.AT](https://bikeleasing.at/arbeitnehmer#c2991).

#### Benefits of Bike Leasing

- Team members can lease bikes at a lower cost than purchasing, thanks to tax advantages and bulk pricing offered by leasing companies.
- Encourages team members to stay fit and healthy by cycling regularly, which can lead to better overall well-being and potentially reduce sick days.
- Promotes eco-friendly commuting, helping reduce a company's carbon footprint.
- The cost is deducted from the team member's salary, spread over a fixed period, making the bike more affordable.

#### Salary Deduction

The exact salary deduction depends on the terms of the lease agreement, but typically, a portion of the gross salary is deducted monthly. This could be calculated based on the bike's value over the leasing period (usually 36 months).

#### Tax Efficiency

Bike leasing is considered a tax-efficient measure in Austria. Since the salary deduction occurs pre-tax, it reduces the employee’s taxable income, thus lowering their income tax liability.

#### Process if resignation is submitted

If you resign before the end of the leasing period, you will generally have a few options:

- Pay the Remaining Balance: You may be required to settle the outstanding lease payments (remaining balance) in a lump sum or through continued payments after resignation.
- Purchase the Bike: Buy the bike at the end of the lease or upon resignation by paying a predefined residual value.
- Transfer to a New Employer/Leasing Company: It may be possible to transfer the leasing contract to a new employer, but this depends on the policies of both the current leasing provider and the new company. So this would need to be clarified with bikeleasing.at directly.

If you would like to sign up for this benefit or have any questions regarding this, please reach out to the Global Expansion team via `gx_employeeexperience@globalexpansion.com`.

### Sick Leave

Section 22(1) to 22(4) of South Africa’s Employment Act stipulates that during each 36-month cycle starting from the first day at work, an employee is entitled to a paid sick leave. This should be equivalent to the exact number of days that they usually work in a typical 6-week period. Therefore, in case the employee works five days per week, then they are entitled to a 30-day sick leave on full pay. On the other hand, if the person works six days per week, then they will have a 36-day sick leave on full pay. When distributed across the three years, one may have a 10 to 12-days paid sick leave per year on average.
