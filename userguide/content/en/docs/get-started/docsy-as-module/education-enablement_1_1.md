## Overview of GitLab Product Training

As a Solutions Architect, Customer Success Manager, or Professional Services Engineer, it is important to be continuously learning more about our product and related industry topics. This handbook page provides an dashboard of aggregated resources that we encourage you to use to get up to speed. Although we aggregated and/or developed these resources for Customer Success team members, they are generic enough that all team members and partners can benefit from the education and enablement resources that we have published here.

## Overview of GitLab Feature and Use Cases

The GitLab product is organized based on the DevOps stages.

### DevOps Stages

If you're new to GitLab and the concept of "stages" are new to you, simply think of it as a category of related features that a customer finds value in with a **technical** narrative. The stages are organized in an infinite loop diagram to show the software development lifecycle from planning to development to release, with additional value for deployed applications with security and monitoring features. You can see a high-level overview of each stage on the [marketing page](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/). Be sure to click the `Learn More` link for each stage to see more about the features of that stage.

One of the most helpful resources for understanding what GitLab does, the features in each stage, and how well the feature works is our [Category maturity](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/maturity/) chart. This may also be informally referred to as our "lovable feature chart".

If you understand what the stages are and want to dive deeper, you can look at the [product categories handbook page](/handbook/product/categories/) for a deep-dive on each of the stages, specifically the [hierarchy](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy) and the [DevOps Stages](/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages).

For the purposes of education and enablement, we focus on the DevOps stages that the customer sees. There are additional stages that help GitLab as a business succeed, such as the [Growth stage](/handbook/product/categories/#growth-stage), [Fulfillment stage](/handbook/product/categories/#fulfillment-stage), [Enablement stage](/handbook/product/categories/#enablement-stage), and [Single Engineer Groups stage](/handbook/product/categories/#single-engineer-groups-section). Although these are not necessarily DevOps stages, the Engineering and Product departments use the stage terminology for consistency. **You do not need to spend time learning about these stages and can search for this information later if the need arises.**

## GitLab Product Topics

## O'Reilly Content Library

In order to facilitate an environment of learning and development, the Customer Success Team has access to the O’Reilly Learning Platform, which is integrated into [GitLab Learn](https://gitlab.edcast.com/log_in?auto_sso=true).  This content library contains thousands of books, videos and live learning courses to assist team members’ with professional development and staying up-to-date with changing technology trends. Additionally, code sandboxes are included within the O’Reilly platform that team members’s can utilize to practice new skills or hone existing ones.

To get started, here is a quick tour of what the O’Reilly Learning Platform can provide to our team, please check out this [short introductory video](https://www.loom.com/share/fca91ca4e127494fb5f4130b85eaa9ea).

If you do not already have a login are outside of the customer success organization, please let the Corproate Learning and Development Team know you are interested. You can also purchase a single licesne with the GitLab pricing by contacting Jason Baca at jbaca@oreilly.com.

### O'Reilly Answer Slack Bot

As part of GitLab's O'Reilly subscription, team members have access to the O'Reilly Answer Slack Bot. To get started, in Slack, just type `/oreilly-answers` followed by your tech question. It’s that simple.

For example:

- `/oreilly-answers` How do I fine-tune a model?
- O’Reilly Answers will respond to your question with highly relevant snippets of content right within Slack.

**More Answers**

Use the “More Answers” button to flip through the suggested answers. O'Reilly will show a maximum of 8 possible answers and you’ll be taken back to the first answer when you get to the end.

**Full Text**

To read the full text of an answer in context click the “Full Text” button and you’ll be taken directly to that snippet of content within the O’Reilly Learning platform.

**Share Answers**

To share a helpful answer with others in Slack click the “Post” button and the answer you selected will be posted to the channel where you asked the question.

If you want to share an answer in a private channel you’ll need to invite the O’Reilly Answers app to the channel first. Simply type: /invite @O’Reilly Answers

If you want to share an answer in a direct message you’ll need to create a group message and include O’Reilly Answers in the group. You can add O’Reilly Answers the same way you would add another person.
