## Form

<sup>*Introduced via [support-team-meta#1329](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/issues/1329)*</sup>

The Personal Data Request form (formerly Account Deletion form) is a simple HTMl form generated via GitLab Pages that is used for personal data requests.

The source code for it is located [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-support-readiness/forms/account-deletion-form).

## Form submission processor

<sup>*Introduced via [support-team-meta#1329](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/issues/1329)*</sup>

When the form is submitted, the [Account Deletion Processor](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-support-readiness/processors/account-deletion-processor) is what processes those request.

## Issue processor

<sup>*Introduced via [support-team-meta#1329](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/issues/1329)*</sup>

This runs every hour to process the issues in the [tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-support-readiness/processors/account-deletion-processor).

It handles the assignment of issues to those who will work them and the tagging of the issues.

## Triage policies

<sup>*Introduced via [support-team-meta#1329](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/issues/1329)*</sup>

Utilizing the [GitLab Triage Gem](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-triage), the triage policies are a group of conditions and actions that are enacted upon issues within the [Account Deletion and Other Requests project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gdpr-request).

The source code for it is located [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gdpr-request/-/blob/master/.triage-policies.yml)
