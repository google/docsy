## <i class="fas fa-users fa-fw icon-color font-awesome"></i>Why Are Sales Stages So Important?

Pipeline management is key to predictable, scalable revenue attainment and can make the difference between simply hitting your number and overachieving. Proper sales pipeline management helps you allocate your time correctly, increase deal velocity, and increase total deal volume, size, and revenue through accurate forecasting practices.

A well-managed sales pipeline requires a clear process with defined activities and exit criteria that serve as a roadmap to getting a deal from discovery to closed won (or qualified out quickly). The following process is specific to the Commercial Sales team and will ensure you have a clean pipeline and accurate forecast.

### 0-Pending Acceptance

*This is the initial stage once an opportunity is created. The Sales Development team will scope business need/ challenge and validate commitment from prospect/customer to have a discovery conversation with the GitLab Team.
It is important to note that Sales Development opportunities could come from inbound interest or outbound interest. There will be additional levels of qualification for inbound interest or existing customers as opposed to opportunities coming from outbound efforts.*

**Primary Activities** to Complete in This Stage:

- Begin filling out [MEDDPPICC](/handbook/sales/meddppicc/) (in required qualification criteria section of the opportunity) - Identify pain/need, Economic buyer, or path to the economic buyer for prospects, plus decision process for inbound leads or current customers.
- Schedule discovery call with AE or SAE
- For SDR sourced opportunities, the opportunity meets [Sales Accepted Opportunity](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#qualification-criteria-and-saos) criteria.
- SDR schedules call, sends invites, creates an event on the account object, names the event: GitLab Introductory Meeting - {{Account Name}}. -
- Input the next step date to highlight when the meeting is set for. Once the invite is accepted by both parties the opportunity ownership will be transferred to the AE/SAE.
- After the discovery conversation and once the sales team has validated that the opportunity meets our Sales Accepted Opportunity criteria, the SAE or AE will move the opportunity to the next stage (Stage 1) and the Amount field must be populated with estimated pipeline. The date the opportunity moves from this to the next stage in the sales cycle will populate the Sales Accepted Date field on the opportunity record.
- If the details on the opportunity do not meet our Sales Accepted Opportunity criteria, the SAE or AE should move the opportunity to an 9-Unqualified stage (this is the only time an opportunity can move into 9-Unqualified stage): SAE / AE should provide a reason as to why the opportunity is deemed unqualified for coaching purposes.
- All Opps that are sales assisted must first enter this stage before they can be moved further in the pipeline. If they do not enter this stage at some point you will encounter a validation rule error.
- For renewal opportunities, 0-Pending Acceptance is only to be used if the renewal is not being actively worked by the Account Executive/Strategic Account Executive.
- Sales Dev team will not create renewal opportunities.

**Exit Criteria:**

*These activities must be completed before moving the prospect to the next stage*

- Completion of sales qualification meeting
- Validation by SAE/AE of the information collected by the Sales Development team member
- Agreed upon next step
