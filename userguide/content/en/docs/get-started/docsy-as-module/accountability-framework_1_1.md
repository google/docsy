Of course! Here's a Comprehensive Accountability Framework based on ISO 14001:2015 principles, broader ISO management system standards (like ISO 9001:2015 for quality, ISO 45001:2018 for health & safety, and ISO 26000 for social responsibility), and best governance practices.

I'll structure it clearly so you can apply or adapt it easily for environmental, quality, safety, sustainability, or broader corporate purposes.
