[primary programming language](#primary-programming-language) of the specialty that they'll be joining.
Because the majority of our codebase is written in Ruby, even in specialized roles, a knowledge of Ruby and Ruby on Rails or a desire to learn and contribute is necessary.

These programming languages are defined as being primary in terms of an engineer's experience and what they'll be writing day to day.
The expectation from the specialty is that engineers will have extensive experience in this primary programming language
as well as some level of understanding of Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
