The GitLab Mentorship program hosted by the Women TMRG is a 5-month career development opportunity for participants to build trust across the organization, enable pathways for internal growth and development, and increase collaboration across teams. The program is hosted in collaboration with the Women's TMRG, GitLab Learning and Development team, and the GitLab DIB team.

Our current program began in July and will end in November 2023. The program includes 137 team members, made up of 73 mentees and 64 mentors.

## History

In 2020, the Women's TMRG partnered with the Sales Organization at GitLab to offer the [Women in Sales Mentorship Program pilot]({{< ref "women-in-sales-mentorship-pilot-program#women-in-sales-mentorship-program-pilot" >}}). This initial iteration was a huge success and inspired the scale of this iteration to include a wider audience. The program now runs on a yearly basis and has been expanded to include mentees who identify as women and non-binary team members.

## Testimonials

Don't take our word for it - check out what mentors and mentees at GitLab have to say about the program!

**From the Mentees**

> This mentorship program has been one of the highlights from my time at GitLab so far. My mentor is a great example of an empathetic leader who is great at strategic planning and communicating effectively. I was able to learn things during the program that I immediately applied to my work, and she inspired and motivated me in a way will persist much longer. My mentor has become one of my new role models, and I plan on keeping in touch with her far beyond this program's end.
>
> This was my first mentorship experience and I'm so glad I participated. I found my self confidence in my mentor session. I lacked that for so many years and to be reminded of my self value and worth was so enriching. I would highly recommend participating!

**From the Mentors**

> I’ve been a Mentor throughout my career, the GitLab program is hands down the best experience I’ve had. Both Mentor and Mentee are provided with resources and guidance to ensure a successful connection.
>
> One of the elements I really enjoyed about this program was the opportunity to meaningfully connect with someone outside of my team - we both learned from each other!

## FAQ

**Can I participate as both a mentor and a mentee?**

Yes, this is a possibility. It's important that team members talk with their managers to discuss their capacity to participate in both roles in this program. Participation in both roles will require a 2hr commitment per month (two 30 minute sessions as a mentor and two 30 minute sessions as a mentee).

It's possible that we will have a shortage of mentors and be unable to complete all mentor/mentee pairs. If there is a shortage of mentors and you've applied as both a mentor and a mentee, you will be assigned **only** as a mentor in this program.

**I participated in a past mentorship program at GitLab. Can I still participate in the current iteration?**

Yes! Past participants in any mentor program and as either mentees, mentors, or both, are encouraged to apply to participate again.

**I'd like to participate but I can't commit the entire length of the program. Can I still apply?**

If you cannot commit to the 5 month program, please consider applying for a future mentorship program at GitLab. It's important that both mentors and mentees are available for the full 5 month program to achieve the best results.

**I'm not eligible to be a mentor or a mentee in this program. What are my options for future participation?**

Other mentorship resources at GitLab can be found [here in the handbook](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor). Team members are always encouraged to build mentor/mentee relationships independently. You can find resources and a list of available mentors in the [Learning and Development handbook](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor)

## Results

### 2023

1. Total Participants: 136 team members / 73 mentor/mentee pairs

In 2023, mentees and mentors were surveyed using Culture Amp before and after the program to meausre key impacts of their mentorship. The following data outlines the impact that mentorship had on these impacts for mentees and mentors.

We used CultureAmp to collect feedback. CultureAmp sorts data as `favorable`, `neutral`, and `unfavorable` based on responses. The data below indicates the rating for each question, and the number by which the score changed from pre to post program, if at all.

**Mentee Results**

All mentee impacts trended upwards post program, with the greatest impact being on mentees sense of support network at GitLab. Survey participation went from 91% to 64% pre to post.

| Question | Trend Pre to Post Program |
| ---------- | ----- |
| I know where to find GitLab resources to support my career growth. | Favorable, +14 |
| I have a network of support to help me reach my goals at GitLab. | Favorable, +30 |
| I have a vision of how I'd like to grow over the next 12 months at GitLab. | Favorable +7 |

**Summary:** The experience of a mentee has an overall favorable rating, and positively impacts mentees knowledge of growth resources, support network, and personal vision.

**Mentor Results**

Both mentor impacts trended sligntly downward. Survey participation went from 91% to 67% pre to post.

| Question | Trend Pre to Post Program |
| ---------- | ----- |
| I have relationships with team members outside of my own department. | Favorable, -2 |
| I am confident in my ability to support others towards achieving their goals. | Favorable, -2 |

**Summary:** The experience of a mentor has an overall favorable rating, with negligible impact on mentors relationships outside their department and confidence in supporting others towards their goals.

- > I am grateful the company has invested in the Women in GitLab mentorship program. My mentor and I had both a very structured approach to our relationship, but then also took the time to get to know each other and build trust, which allowed for open and honest discussions. I would recommend other team members showing up for this program, both on the mentor and mentee side!
- > Having someone that is not my manager to work through developmental goals has been extraordinary and I am grateful to my mentor for all the feedback and support as I went from feeling heavy with imposter syndrome to believing in myself and my knowledge level!
- > Women at GitLan Mentorship Program has been a crucial experience for me. My mentor is an outstanding leader who supported me in most useful ways, strengthening especially my self-value and goal-setting skills. She sought out opportunities for me, asked good questions and listened intently - all that has already helped with furthering my career development here at GitLab. I'm grateful to her and for that program, and I recommend it greatly.
- > The Women at GitLab Mentorship program gave me the opportunity to grow as a mentor by providing resources on how to better my listening and guidance skills so that I could better mentor across disciplines.
- > The GitLab mentorship program is an incredible opportunity to step out of your usual role and look at your management style from a more holistic perspective, taking a moment to get out of the weeds and look more at the big picture. I learned so much from my mentee! I took these learnings back to my team, in terms of my management style. It also gave me time to recognize the strengths of my team in terms of how we present large initiatives to a boarder audience as this was an ask of my mentee and something we worked on together.
