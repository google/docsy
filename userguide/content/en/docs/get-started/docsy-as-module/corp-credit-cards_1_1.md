## 1. POLICY

- The purpose of this Navan Physical Card policy is to facilitate purchases necessary for the company operations and expedite the process in an efficient manner.
- The introduction of this mode of payment is not to override the procedures set forth in the Company’s Procurement Policy, but to provide an alternative method of purchase for lower cost necessary goods and services.
- This policy intends to ensure that Navan Physical Cards are used for appropriate business purposes and that adequate controls are installed for regular use.

**This policy applies to**:

- Ad hoc Vendor’s & less than $5,000 USD for the transaction.
- In case of transactions where the vendor only accepts credit card payments.

**Please note that the policy restricts the use of the card**:

- To bypass the GitLab Procurement process.
- For any charges above 5,000 USD; as they must submit through Zip for procurement processing.
- For any items already noted as not permissible per the Expense policy (ie. software).
- For the additional items noted as “non-permissible” and should be personally expensed that are listed  below in section 4.

To ensure good financial management and sound corporate governance, cards are only provided to team members under their name, and with the request/approval of the Direct Manager, and Chief Accounting Officer’s final approval. These approvals are documented in an issue for tracking purposes.

## 2. General Guidelines

- All card charges require a receipt, with exception of US team members in which receipts are required for
anything over $50.   You can add the receipt once the charge reflects in Navan Cards, and in any event within 30 days.
- If a card holder is missing a receipt, a Missing Receipt Affidavit will need to be completed and attached to the expense.  Note: Missing Receipt Affidavit should be attached as a PDF.
- Ensure to use the appropriate Expense type for proper allocation. If the expense type is not on the list, you may use the “Other” category and add any supporting details in the description field.
- If applicable, add expense tags under "Classifications" to the related purchase. Common expense tag examples include company Contributes, marketing campaigns and professional service engagements.
- Non-Permissible items will be flagged upon charge. Please ensure to only use the card for items under permissible items only.
- Purchases on your card should not exceed $5,000 USD for each transaction.
- If your purchase will be over $5,000 USD, you will need to enter a Purchase Requisition in Zip. AP prefers to pay vendors by ACH whenever possible. To get started with Zip for a vendor who can be paid by normal invoicing and payment methods, see [Zip End Users Guide](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/zip-guide/).
- If a charge is made in error, please reach out to expenses@gitlab.com on the process to reimburse GitLab. It is an arduous process, so we ask to avoid this at all cost.
- Any reports with continuous violations to our policy will be subject to management review and could be taken away for non-compliance.
