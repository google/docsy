  - Chris: we’re looking for contributors

  - Chris: the Green Web Foundation got a little bit of funding to explore grid aware websites, went a little bit wider with it and outlined some topics in the CfC. We’re looking for folks who dream of a more sustainable web. Reach me here, or [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/green-web-foundation_our-latest-call-for-contributions-to-the-activity-7313558260911857665-QDts?utm_source=share\&utm_medium=member_desktop\&rcm=ACoAAABm1l0BbWA0yfBII3qorrH90vnZOI-51PY).

- Other announcements

## Open issues:

- [Release notes for Q1-2025 published](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/releases)

  - Alex: I added a changelog to the doc itself. We also shared recent updates in the Slack channel, but it is useful to have an overview of what has happened since CG -> IG transition. Feel free to have a look through it

- [GitHub Issues better tagged](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues) (would Kanban overview be useful?)

  - Alex: We tagged the issues better in the [GH rep](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues) and tagged which TF they belong to so that it’s easier to see which questions are relevant to whom. If people would find it useful I can put them into a kanban board.

  - Tim: love a good kanban board. (others agree)

  - Alex: will send a link to the chairs, will need someone from W3C Team to set it up.

- GSF’s upcoming workshop (Chris): The GSF is organising a series of SCI for Web workshops in May and June. The GSF and W3C are both membership organisations funded by members so we are working out a way to involve W3C Sustainability IG Invited Experts, to allow free access and avoid duplication of existing work.

    - Chris: worked with GSF and was invited to lead the process for web within the org. We’re trying to figure out how to make it apply to web and make guidance useful to use. There is quite a lot of overlap between what is happening in the Web Sustainability IG and at Green Software Foundation. GSF and W3C are both membership orgs. We’re trying to work out how to make these groups + invited experts collaborate, should be able to share more about how to get involved before the next meeting. This will be about the boundary setting between what is counted and not counted in terms of measuring carbon emissions.

    - Tzviya: we’re keen to make sure we’re all working together and ideally avoid creating slightly overlapping specifications.
    - Chris: would prob be starting mid May, meeting every 2 weeks or so, a lot of async work, trying to land something in July.
    - Oli: At Root & Branch we have a draft version of a specification that looks at the maps, “SCI for web”, we have an example of how that may work. Would be good to get some eyes on.
    - Chris - this is why we want to have invited experts involved in the paper - please keep channels open. This is why we need W3C IG involvement - because these people have already been thinking about this in a structured fashion. Our accounting system was based on Shell’s metrics (See [this podcast interview with Killian Daly of Energy Tag where we touch on where Scope 2](https://podcasts.castplus.fm/e/p8lxlvl8-how-to-tell-when-energy-is-green-with-killian-daly) came from and [this interview with Laurent Segelene on the topic - see 8:07](https://news.wickedproblems.uk/p/laurent-segalen-an-electric-nato)).
    - Oli: can send it to everyone who;s interested, will share with you Chris.
    - Tim: please share the orgs you’re thinking of publishing this at.
    - Oli: currently working with University of Sussex - want things to be openly available, not disappearing in dusty journals, maybe publish through W3C to ensure it gets enough eyes on it as possible. Not saying it is the only way to measure SCI for the web but it’s good to pick it apart.

- **Rose:** [Chapter intro sections](https://englishroseberlin-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/p/rose/EZe1ored0pVCoyZtLnr6GM4B0zp1oHNEvU3lqqDsm25ZZw?rtime=O1PIl2Vx3Ug) (re-written for clarity - draft)

  - Original: [UX](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/#user-experience-design) / [WebDev](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/#web-development) / [Infrastructure](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/#hosting-infrastructure-and-systems) / [Business](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/#business-strategy-and-product-management)

  - Please provide feedback here or in TF Slack channels!

  - Rose: we looked at a lot of things re restructuring things, and tried to make things more harmonised. The link above is the draft for how the sections will look in the future. Have been moving things in different places, and there’s a new section further up where the other benefits are included, to make it easier to show to C level. We’ve also tried to make it less audience specific. Where I need support from you: web sustainability not my main expertise, so please help check if I didn’t miss anything. My next task will be to go to individual chapters and clarify questions I have. I don’t want to take away work from Alex, but help him focus.

  - Tim: thanks for all your work on this.

  - Tzviya: for now the docs are in Word. If this doesn’t work for you, it will eventually go to GitHub.

## TF Breakouts

Other discussion/questions:

- Infra/Hosting : review in progress by Ryan. Then we should share this with an external reviewer, for instance from Google.

- Measurability: discussed separating out the act of measuring the inputs, from making claims about the sustainability outcomes from this using a model. With this approach at present, it’s _the job of the model_ to turn this input into some kind of claim about the environmental consequences.
