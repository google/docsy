title: "GitLab Communication Chat"
---

## Introduction

At GitLab, Slack is critical to our communication with each other.  While it enables real-time communication, we also are careful to remain true to our asynchronous mindset, suggesting that GitLab team-members set "do not disturb" and not expect real-time answers from others all the time.

There are groups of channels that can help with various areas of GitLab. This page speaks to a few subsets of those channel groups.

## Search

Search for channels using either the `Search GitLab` toolbar, using a channel name with the `#channel-name` format, **or** go the left sidebar, click on `More` and then `Channel browser`.

## Channels

### Key Slack channels

The alphabetically sorted starter list below spotlights a few of GitLab's many Slack channels in an effort to provide guidance to team members regarding the best places to ask specific questions and/or engage in discussion on a variety of topics. See Slack's [Help Center](https://slack.com/help/articles/205239967-Join-a-channel) for instructions on browsing all available channels.

### Channel Categories

#### Account Channels (a_)

These channels (prefixed with a `a_`) are for team members to collaborate and communicate regarding the account for a customer organization. Depending on the customer, they are sometimes internal, marked as private or we shared with the customer by connecting to customer's own Slack workspace. In order to clearly differentiate between these shared and internal channels, we recommend using `a_XYZ-internal` and `a_XYZ-external` naming conventions to be explicitly clear (as the shared symbol can be easily missed in Slack).

To request a new channel or to make changes to existing channels, please use the [access request process](/handbook/business-technology/end-user-services/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#slack-google-groups-1password-vaults-or-groups-access-requests).

Commercial (Mid-Market and SMB) accounts have specific guidelines around having Slack channels with customers.

#### Feature Channels (f_)

These channels are for teams and GitLab team-members interested in a specific feature that exists in GitLab or is being built today!

**Examples**

- **[`#f_web_ide`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/f_web_ide)**: Share ideas and feedback about our [Web IDE](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/06/15/introducing-gitlab-s-integrated-development-environment/)
- **[`#f_ldap`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/f_ldap)**: Talk about our integration with [LDAP providers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/auth/ldap/index.html).

#### Group Channels (g_)

Group channels (prefixed with a `g_`) correspond to a [DevOps Stage group](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy) and other [engineering departments and teams](/handbook/engineering/#engineering-departments--teams).

**Example**

- **[`#g_create`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/g_create)**: Channel for the [Create](/handbook/product/categories/#create-stage) development group.
- **[`#g_create_source-code`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/g_create_source-code)**: Channel for the [Source Code](/handbook/product/categories/#source-code-group) development group.
- **[`#g_geo`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/g_geo)**: Dedicated to the [Geo group](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/systems/geo/).

#### Location Channels (loc_)

These channels are used to help GitLab team-members who are in the same general region of the world to talk about get-togethers and other location-specific items. They are also instrumental if you're going to be visiting somewhere else in the world - there might be a GitLab team-member or two nearby! Feel free to join the channel temporarily to chat with GitLab team-members who live there, and see if there is an opportunity to leverage the [visiting grant](/handbook/total-rewards/incentives/#visiting-grant) to add value to your trip.

#### Social Groups

In addition to weekly company group calls that bring us together, GitLab has Social Slack Groups. Social Groups are Slack channels that bring team members together around common interests, hobbies, and lifestyles. Think tennis club, gaming, shell collectors, movie buffs, faith groups, football. You can see a list of Social Slack Groups and their tags below. Feel free to join any that resonate with you. This is a non-exhaustive list, but if you don't see a group you'd love to see on the list, reach out to our diversity, inclusion and belonging team and we'd love to explore your idea.
