## The Market Viewpoint

## Artifact management

As an Admin at a large, enterprise organization you need to enable your developers to point their tools like Maven, npm,or pip at a local proxy server for all of the dependencies that they need. The server must be able to fetch dependencies from remote repositories, cache the artifacts, and be able to export its database of them to an air-gapped system at a regular interval. You need the ability to easily apply policies when dependencies are initially downloaded‚Äîeither scanning them for security vulnerabilities or applying some other selection criteria (allowable license, allowable package author, etc.).

Well the air-gapped requirement might be a bit much, the above is what I typically hear from our customers. You can just as easily add in requirements like geo-replication, high-availability, and auditing. If you are a large organization, you need help with artifact management. Why large organizations? Well, smaller development teams can typically work with the myriad of artifact management solutions out there because they likely:

- Only pull packages from public repositories like Maven Central
- Only have projects in one or two programming languages
- The developers can manage shared config files that handle how packages are downloaded and from where

For large organizations:

- You likely have projects in many different programming languages, including some you've probably forgotten about.
- Since you have many developers, it's hard to manage the various configuration files needed to securely manage how and where dependencies are downloaded from.
- You likely have much stricter compliance requirements.
- You may have team members spread out across the globe and you need download times to be fast and reliable from anywhere.
- You may have several affiliate companies or vendors that you'd like to give access to read or publish packages.
- You need to know who is downloading packages, how often and if there is any suspicious activity. (This probably can be stated under compliance)

I guess you can surmise from reading the above that the problem of artifact management is tough for large, complex organizations. So, why make it harder by spending more money on additional tools. The trend towards consolidation make sense. It's why companies like JFrog and Sonatype have been striving to expand their products from universal artifact managers to complete DevOps platforms.

GitLab can save you money and time with the GitLab Artifact Management offering. In the below article, we'd like to walk you through the requirements of an artifact management tool, how GitLab compares to the competition, and how you should evaluate vendors.

## Personas

The personas for this use case are going to focus on large, complex organizations that need a tool for securely managing dependencies in a variety of formats from many different sources.

## Market Requirements

| Market Requirement                    | Description |
|---------                              |-------------|
| 1) Package Registry                   | The GitLab Package Registry acts as a private or public registry for a variety of common package managers. You can publish and share packages, which can be easily consumed as a dependency in downstream projects.|
| 2) Container registry                 | A highly scalable application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images. |
| 3) API                                | An API for all features is required for supporting your customer workflows.       |
| 4) Storage management                 | Dependencies can build up fast. You need a way to manage storage costs.          |
| 5) Extensive metadata                 | Dependency metadata is required to validate you are using the correct one.       |
| 6) Dependency scanning                | Automatically find security vulnerabilities in your dependencies while you‚Äôre developing and testing your applications.  |
| 7) Dependency firewall                | Prevent the introduction of security vulnerabilities from external dependencies  |
| 8) Virtual registries                 | A collection of local, remote, and other virtual repositories accessed through a single logical URL. This hides the access details of the underlying repositories letting users work with a single, well-known URL.          |
| 9) High availability                  | A highly available product will ensure your teams stay productive                |
| 10) Geo replication                   | You can set up a Docker Registry on your secondary Geo site that mirrors the one on the primary Geo site.           |
| 11) Searchable dependencies           | It should be easy to search for and discover dependencies.                       |
| 12) Certified dependencies (or images)| Protect important dependencies from being corrupted or overridden.               |

## Adoption Guide

The following section provides resources to help CSMs lead capabilities adoption, but can also be used for prospects or customers interested in adopting GitLab stages and categories.

### Playbook Steps

1. Ask [Discovery Questions](#discovery-questions) to identify customer need.
2. Complete the deeper dive discovery sharing demo, proof points, value positioning, etc.
3. Agree to adoption roadmap, timeline and change management plans, offering relevant services (as needed) and updating the success plan (as appropriate)
4. Lead the adoption plan with the customer, enabling teams and tracking progress through engagement and/or product analytics data showing use case adoption
