## Program Preparation

### Confidentiality

As a shadow, you'll have access to confidential information. Specifically, if you chose to shadow an SA leader outside of your Geo (AMER, APJ, EMEA), you will require compliance with the [Designated Insiders process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mcBtnfGbv4jSsJUklMQYyj2052MBHe4Lf9RkE-B9yvA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.b3pm8ljoip1y) for a period of time. Even after this period is complete, the program's success depends on continually maintaining this trust beyond the duration of the shadow. If you are shadowing an SA leader in your same Geo, there is no need to be added to grow through a specific [Designated Insiders process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mcBtnfGbv4jSsJUklMQYyj2052MBHe4Lf9RkE-B9yvA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.b3pm8ljoip1y).

:bulb: **NOTE:** the DI review process happens quarterly and DI access lasts at least a quarter (subject to Legal Team evaluation), so the SA Shadow will be added to the DI list for an entire quarter as a minimum. To make sure everything is done in transparency and respect of rules for Gitlab and GitLab employyes, the SA Manager will need to open an SA Shadow onboarding/offboarding issue using this [template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/solutions-architecture-leaders/sa-initiatives/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/SA%20Shadow%20template.md?ref_type=heads). The SA Shadown onboarding/offboarding issue has to be opened a quarter in advance from the SA joining the SA Leader Shadow program.

### Getting Ready for Your Shadowing Experience

Ensure you've made necessary preparations before beginning.

Take time to review your calendar and confirm you can fully commit to this development opportunity. Verify that your current workload allows for dedicated shadowing time, and arrange coverage for any essential deals under your responsibility. Before starting, have a detailed conversation with your assigned manager to get clarity on the shadowing schedule and expectations.

To provide you with diverse leadership exposure, you'll be matched with a leader outside your direct reporting line. This intentional pairing allows you to observe and learn from different management approaches and leadership styles.

The SA leader you will shadow will maximise your exposure to a diverse set of activities, however some of them may not be available during your shadowing and this is up to the shadowing SA leader discretion.
