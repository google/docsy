Policy Statement:
Green Orbit Digital recognizes the importance of maintaining a secure and safe work environment for all employees and visitors. As part of our commitment to security and access control, all employees are required to wear an identification badge while on company premises or representing the company at off-site locations. This policy outlines the requirements for obtaining, wearing, and displaying identification badges.

Procedure:

1. Issuance of Identification Badges:

- New Employee Orientation: Upon joining Green Orbit Digital, new employees will be provided with an identification badge during the orientation process.

- Replacement Badges: In the event of loss, theft, or damage to an identification badge, employees must promptly notify the HR department to request a replacement badge. A replacement fee may apply in certain circumstances.

2. Badge Design and Information:

- The identification badge will prominently display the employee's name, position/title, and department.

- The badge will also include a color-coded designation or symbol indicating the employee's level of access within the company premises.

3. Wearing and Displaying Badges:

- Visible Display: Employees are required to wear their identification badges visibly at all times while on company premises or representing the company off-site.

- Proper Placement: Badges should be worn on the outermost garment (e.g., shirt, blouse, jacket) at chest level, with the photo and name clearly visible.

4. Badge Use and Access Control:

- Access Control: Identification badges serve as a form of access control, allowing employees to enter designated areas within the company premises based on their level of authorization.

- Badge Sharing Prohibited: Employees are strictly prohibited from sharing their identification badges with others. Badges are non-transferable and may only be used by the assigned employee.

5. Reporting Lost or Stolen Badges:

- Immediate Notification: Employees must report any lost or stolen identification badges to the HR department as soon as possible.

- Deactivation: Upon notification, the HR department will deactivate the lost or stolen badge to prevent unauthorized access to company premises.

6. Return of Badges:

- Termination or Resignation: Upon termination of employment or resignation, employees are required to return their identification badge to the HR department.

7. Badge Renewal:

- Annual Renewal: Identification badges will be subject to annual renewal to ensure accuracy and currency of employee information.

8. Compliance:

- Enforcement: Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all employees of Green Orbit Digital. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

9. Review and Updates:

- Periodic Review: This policy will be reviewed periodically by the HR department to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

- Updates: Any updates or revisions to the policy will be communicated to all employees in a timely manner.

10. Policy Acknowledgment:

- All employees are required to review and acknowledge their understanding of this policy upon issuance of their identification badge and periodically thereafter as part of ongoing training and compliance initiatives.
