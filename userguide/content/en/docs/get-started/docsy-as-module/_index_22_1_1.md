title: "Identity User Guide - Policy Management"
description: "The Identity Platform manages the top-level of administrative access and infrastructure for GitLab systems access, and manages access policies for our tech stack applications. We manage all configuration using Terraform (Configuration/Infrastructure-as-Code) or REST API (guess and check policy enforcement with API endpoints) base state management with a GitOps CI/CD approach. This page provides a quick reference guide and runbooks for how we have embedded change management in all of our processes and automation with configuration-as-code state management, merge request approval rules, approval user experience, audit and diff logging, and more."
