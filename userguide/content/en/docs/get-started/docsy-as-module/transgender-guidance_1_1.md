Green Orbit Digital Transgender Guidance Policy

1. Purpose

Green Orbit Digital is committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and supportive environment for all employees, regardless of gender identity. This Transgender Guidance Policy aims to provide clear, practical guidance to create a welcoming and safe workplace for transgender and gender-diverse employees. The policy seeks to support individuals in their gender transition and to ensure that everyone is treated with dignity, respect, and equality.

1. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and any other individuals associated with Green Orbit Digital, regardless of gender identity or gender expression. It outlines the company’s approach to supporting transgender employees through their transitions and ensures that the rights of transgender employees are respected at all stages of employment.

1. Definitions

Transgender: A term used to describe individuals whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.

Gender Identity: An individual's deeply-held sense of their gender, which may be different from the sex assigned at birth.

Gender Expression: The outward manifestation of a person’s gender identity, including appearance, clothing, hairstyle, mannerisms, and behaviours.

Transitioning: The process through which a person changes aspects of their physical appearance, name, gender presentation, and other aspects of their gender identity, typically to align more closely with their gender identity.

Non-binary: A gender identity that does not fit strictly within the categories of male or female. People may identify as a combination of both, neither, or fall somewhere in between.

1. Principles of Inclusion

Green Orbit Digital is dedicated to ensuring that:

Equality and Respect: All transgender employees will be treated equally, with respect and dignity, and have the same opportunities as any other employee.

Confidentiality: Any information regarding an employee’s gender identity or transition will be handled with the utmost confidentiality and sensitivity. Disclosure of such information will be at the discretion of the employee.

Support for Transgender Employees: Green Orbit Digital recognises that transitioning is a deeply personal process and that each employee may experience it differently. The company will provide appropriate support and flexibility throughout this process.

1. Creating a Transgender-Friendly Environment

Respecting Name and Pronouns: Employees should refer to their colleagues by the name and pronouns that the individual prefers. This applies to all forms of communication, both verbal and written. Managers and colleagues should be mindful to correct mistakes politely and without drawing undue attention to the error.

Gender-Neutral Facilities: Green Orbit Digital is committed to providing access to gender-neutral restrooms, changing facilities, and other amenities that respect all employees’ gender identities. Employees are welcome to use facilities corresponding to their gender identity or any gender-neutral options available.

Inclusive Language: All internal and external communications should use inclusive and gender-neutral language, where possible. This includes avoiding assumptions about an employee’s gender and using terms like “they/them” or “everyone” instead of gendered language like “he/she” or “guys.”

Dress Code: Green Orbit Digital will ensure that its dress code is inclusive and not gender-specific, allowing employees to wear attire that aligns with their gender identity or gender expression.

1. Transitioning at Work

Initiating a Transition: If an employee decides to transition, they should feel supported and able to approach their manager or HR with confidence. Transitioning employees can choose the level of disclosure they are comfortable with, and Green Orbit Digital will provide support as needed, including flexible arrangements for medical appointments or changes to work practices.

Workplace Adjustments: The company is committed to providing any reasonable workplace adjustments during an employee’s transition, which may include:

Flexible work schedules to accommodate medical appointments or therapy.

A phased return to work if the transition involves medical procedures.

Updates to workplace records, including name, gender identity, and contact details, in accordance with the employee's wishes.

Communication and Disclosure: Employees transitioning may wish to inform colleagues about their gender identity and transition at their own pace. Green Orbit Digital will support employees in preparing communication plans for sharing information with colleagues, ensuring that any disclosure is handled sensitively and respectfully.

1. Harassment, Discrimination, and Bullying

Zero Tolerance for Discrimination: Green Orbit Digital has a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination, harassment, or bullying based on gender identity or expression. This includes any form of verbal, physical, or online harassment, as well as microaggressions or inappropriate comments.

Complaint Process: Employees who experience or witness discrimination, harassment, or bullying are encouraged to report the incident immediately to HR or their line manager. All complaints will be taken seriously and investigated promptly in accordance with the company’s grievance procedure.

Support for Affected Employees: Employees who have been subjected to discrimination or harassment will be provided with appropriate support, including counselling services, and will not be subject to retaliation for making a complaint.

1. Legal Compliance and Rights

Green Orbit Digital complies with all relevant laws, including the Equality Act 2010 (UK), and other relevant local, national, or international laws, that protect the rights of transgender employees from discrimination based on gender identity or expression. This includes:

The right to be treated with respect and dignity.

The right to privacy, including the confidentiality of personal information regarding gender identity and transition.

The right to work in an environment free from harassment, bullying, or discrimination.

1. Training and Education

Training for Employees: Green Orbit Digital will provide regular training for all employees on transgender inclusion, focusing on respectful communication, understanding gender identity, and addressing potential issues in the workplace. This will ensure that employees are well-equipped to support their transgender colleagues.

Manager and HR Training: Managers and HR personnel will receive specialised training to ensure they are able to effectively support employees through their transition, understand legal requirements, and foster an inclusive work environment. This training will cover topics such as managing medical leave, updating records, and handling workplace conflict respectfully.

1. Privacy and Confidentiality

Green Orbit Digital will handle all personal information relating to an employee's gender identity and transition with strict confidentiality. Disclosure of an employee's gender identity, medical status, or transition status will only occur with the employee's explicit consent and where necessary for business purposes (e.g., benefits, medical leave). Employees’ preferences about the disclosure of their gender identity will always be respected.

1. Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed on an annual basis or as required to ensure that it remains up-to-date with legal requirements and best practices. Any updates to the policy will be communicated to all employees.

1. Conclusion

Green Orbit Digital is committed to fostering a workplace that respects and supports transgender and gender-diverse employees. By providing clear guidelines, creating an inclusive environment, and offering support during transitions, we aim to ensure that all employees feel valued, respected, and empowered to bring their authentic selves to work.
