## **Deep dive into Customer Experience (CX)**

Understanding how this critical practice drives customer-centricity in GitLab

## **What is Customer Experience (CX)?**

Customer Experience (CX) encompasses the entire customer journey, from initial awareness, evaluation and purchase to post-sales adoption and expansion, focusing on creating positive, seamless, and meaningful interactions to build loyalty and satisfaction. CX focuses on understanding customer needs, expectations, and emotions to create meaningful, seamless experiences that foster loyalty and advocacy.

## **What Customer Experience (CX) is not**

* **Just customer service:** Customer service is one component of the overall customer experience   
* **Limited to UX:** UX is an important *element* of the customer experience, but it is not the totality of the experience.  
* **A one-time fix:** CX is not a one-time project but rather an ongoing strategic approach  
* **A department-specific initiative:** CX requires a cross-functional approach, with all departments working together to create a consistent and positive experience. 

## **Goals of Customer Experience (CX)**

* **Increase customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention** through delivering exceptional experiences and building strong customer relationships to drive repeat business  
* **Reduce customer effort and friction across touchpoints** by identifying top areas of friction to remediate cross-functionally.  
* **Build a positive brand.** Drive positive word-of-mouth and advocacy, and differentiate from competitors in crowded markets.  
* **Increase customer lifetime value** and reduce acquisition costs by retaining customers and encouraging repeat purchases to increase the long-term value for each customer.  
* **Align organizational processes and culture around customer needs**, creating customer-first organization and product.

## **Common Customer Experience (CX) Deliverables**

**Experience Design Frameworks**. Structured approaches for designing new experiences or improving existing ones based on customer insights.

**CX Data Analytics & Reporting**. Define and track CX metrics and KPIs like Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and churn rate to track CX performance and more.
