### Monitoring and Review Procedure for ISO 31000

ISO 31000 provides guidelines for risk management, including the need for continuous monitoring and review to ensure that risk management practices are effective and aligned with organizational objectives. The Monitoring and Review procedure ensures that risks are consistently monitored, assessed, and managed throughout their lifecycle. This procedure aims to provide a structured approach to track the progress of risk management activities and to make necessary adjustments based on emerging risks or changes in circumstances.
