## Working on ASE Tickets

### New tickets

All new non-emergency tickets from a customer that paid for an Assigned
Support Engineer (ASE) [will get automatically assigned to that ASE](onboarding.html#auto-assign-the-customers-tickets).

See [what to do when the ASE is unavailable](#when-the-ase-is-unavailable) and
[what to do if they came in requesting a different region](#tickets-in-a-different-region).

#### New Emergency tickets

See [ASE emergencies](emergencies.html).

### Pre-existing tickets

Tickets that predated the introduction of the ASE are treated a little
differently because of their individual histories. Let the customer decide
who they'd like to work on this problem with - the existing assignee or the
ASE. If they'd like the ASE to own it, then the current assignee and the ASE
should communicate with each other so the ASE knows the history of the problem
handled in the ticket, the customer's expectations, and anything else the current
assignee would find useful to share.

### When the ASE is unavailable

An ASE can be unavailable for a variety of reasons such as being off or having
a different Support priority at the moment. When that happens and you notice a
ticket of theirs that will breach or was missed, feel free to respond to that
ticket yourself, but be sure to leave the ASE as the assignee and `cc`
yourself until they return. Upon their return, they'll take the ticket.

#### Tickets in a different region

Tickets in a different region will still get assigned to the ASE. If they'll
breach before the ASE gets online then that means
[the ASE is unavailable so follow this process](#when-the-ase-is-unavailable).
