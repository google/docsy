## Lauren Barker README

I'm [Lauren Barker](/handbook/company/team/#laurenbarker), Engineering Manager for Digital Experience. I lead by creating inclusive environments that empower teams to exceed their goals. I do this with strategic collaboration, communication, and a dose of humor. [I'm currently working on these projects](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/-/boards/3289410?iteration_id=Current&assignee_username=laurenbarker).

### How I work

#### I work daily on building and maintaining trust

Trusting people and being able to be trusted is crucial to a happy and productive work environment for everyone and it takes continuous work.

#### My focus as a manager

- The role of the IC is deep focus on difficult technical tasks.
- My role as a Manager is to focus on the big picture, filter the noise, to work with Marketing and help prepare the work as achievable pieces, then remove any roadblocks so scheduled work can be merged.
- Together, we deliver GitLab's marketing digital experience.

#### 1:1s

1:1s with my team are the most important part of my day.

Team 1:1s are a meeting where I listen to your concerns and ideas, and strive to take immediate follow-up actions. I am happy for you to completely drive this meeting.

To keep notes, we have an ongoing Google document and for topic inspiration, we have an optional template.
