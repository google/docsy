### What's New in GitLab üöÄ

The GitLab 13.9 release is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:

- **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk:** Teams no longer have to worry about balancing the security and availability of production environments with the new Security Alert Dashboard, which allows teams to discern between suspicious network activity that needs to be blocked immediately or that only needs further attention, minimizing disruption to users.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** The latest release further supports distributed teams through reduced downtime and increased visibility. This includes GitLab‚Äôs new Maintenance Mode, which enables read-only availability of customers‚Äô instances during admin tasks. This also includes the addition of  Release Analytics at the group level, which continues to grow our support of [DORA metrics](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/devops-metrics/).
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** 13.9 makes the path to ‚Äúbetter products, faster‚Äù much more attainable with automation that helps identify redundancies in configuration and automation that helps mitigate complexity by making it easier to view pipeline configurations broken into many files and manage deployment processes leveraging parent-child or multi-project pipelines with resource groups.
