## CMOC Practice Events

Support Engineering aims to conduct practice CMOC incident events globally every quarter. The exact date & time of each event (1 per region) will not be known to the CMOC ahead of time. This is to simulate the nature of live events being unexpected.

### Purpose

The practice events provide an opportunity to practice the activities and processes related to the CMOC responsibility. They are not a test that can be passed or failed, but rather a team exercise to gain experience, and an opportunity to iterate on the process and documentation.

### Outcomes

- Familiarity with tools like Status.io so that in a real emergency theyâ€™re not a blocker to communication
- Increased familiarity with the CMOC process and confidence in a live event
- Familiarity with the incident room, Slack #incident-management channel and how communication is formalized between Incident Manager, EOC and CMOC during the course of an incident
- An opportunity to retrospect and get live feedback from a friendly audience

### Participants

- a manager or senior support engineer will fulfill the role of the **Incident Manager** (and EOC if appropriate) and facilitate the practice event and scenario
- a **note taker** (another manager or senior engineer) will take notes of any learnings, improvements or gaps in documentation or process identified during the event
- the rostered  **CMOC** will participate as though it were a live incident (but without the pressure of an actual incident or busy incident room!)

### How to: Create and coordinate a quarterly practice event

**Assumption**:  a DRI has been assigned to act as the coordinator for the quarter. The following needs to be completed (or delegated for completion) by the coordinator:

- Start by creating a new practice event issue from the [template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/CMOC%20Practice%20Event.md)

The template includes instructions of other artefacts to create and how to schedule the events.
