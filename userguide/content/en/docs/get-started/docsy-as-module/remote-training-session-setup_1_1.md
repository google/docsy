## Professional Services Remote Training Session Setup and Reporting

Professional Services has a shared Zoom account for remote training deliveries to customers. This enables the entire team to schedule, modify, and start training sessions from the same account, as well as access all session recordings and attendee reports. This page describes the procedure for setting up training sessions and accessing post-session recording and reporting.

### Log in

1. Obtain the login credentials for the Professional Services Zoom account from the 1Password team vault.
1. Open up an incognito browser tab and navigate to the Zoom sign in page to log into the shared account.

### Schedule the training sessions

1. In the Zoom shared account, click **Webinars** from the left navigation menu.

1. Check the list of scheduled webinars on the **Upcoming Webinars** tab to make sure none are scheduled to overlap with the one you need to schedule. **Important Note!** Zoom does not allow concurrent meetings or webinars to run from the same Zoom account. Even if you designate an alternate host, one of the meetings or webinars must be ended in order for the other session to initiate. If you see a webinar already scheduled that overlaps with the time slot you need to schedule, you must use a different Zoom account to schedule the session. For details see this [Zoom help article](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206122046-Can-I-Host-Concurrent-Meetings-).

1. Click the **Webinar Templates** tab.

1. Locate the template name of the course you want to set up the session for.

1. Click **Schedule a Webinar with this template**.

1. In the title for the session, add the customer name. For example, "GitLab CI/CD Training -- Acme Corporation."

1. Adjust the date and time.
    - Each course includes two 4-hour sessions. Select the date of the first session
    - Adjust the start time to the confirmed start time in the customer’s preferred time zone.

1. Leave the settings as-is for Registration, Password, Video, Audio, and Webinar Options.

1. Set the Alternative Host.
    - Click **Advanced Options** and enter your email address. This will enable you to join the session as the host from your own Zoom account.
    - Click **Save**.

### Adjust the registration page

Zoom templates do not include most of the branding used to set up the original template, so you’ll need to make some adjustments for each webinar you schedule.

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page for the webinar you just scheduled and click the **Branding** tab.

    - Change the title to say the name of the training and the customer’s name (for example, “GitLab CI/CD Training for FRB Kansas City”).

    - Click **Save**.

1. Under **Post Attendee URL**, you can click **Edit** to adjust the URL you want attendees to see when you end the webinar session as needed.

1. Click **Save**.

### Restrict the number of registrants

1. On the **Invitations** tab in the **Approval Options** section click **Edit**.

1. On the **Registrations** tab check the box for **Restrict number of registrants**.

### Adjust the email settings

1. On the "Polls/Survey" tab in the **Survey** row, click **Use a 3rd party survey** and paste in [the link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdTGl7Wwcw2yzFpvCd5jYMPgOf_lp8BYMKKhaW0Mrpt51TXg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to the training survey.
