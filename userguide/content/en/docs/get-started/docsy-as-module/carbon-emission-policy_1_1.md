- Scope 2 (Indirect emissions from purchased electricity)

- Scope 3 (Other indirect emissions)

## 3. Emission Reduction Targets

We aim to achieve the following reductions:

- 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030

- 90% reduction in absolute emissions across all scopes by 2040

## 4. Carbon Reduction Measures
