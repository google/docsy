title: "Secure and Govern Internship Program"
---







## Overview

The best way to learn about something is by doing it. The best feedback
comes directly from working with end-users and the product directly. At GitLab,
we have the opportunity to get more direct product feedback and help folks
learn more about security at the same time.

For folks interested in learning more about security and/or Product Management,
we are offering the opportunity to an internship with the Secure and Govern
Product Management team.

## Internship options and scope

Each iteration of the internship will be slightly different, depending on the
intern's interests and expertise, the specific projects involved, as well as the
mentor. Interns should choose one of the following two internship track options:

1. An internship focused on adding our Secure and Govern features to open source projects hosted on GitLab.com
1. An internship where the intern shadows a Product Manager and plays an active, mentored role in taking responsibility for a feature

All interns will be paired with a mentor. Before starting the internship program,
the intern and mentor should have a kickoff call to understand the intern's
interest, skills, and availability to then figure out specific goals to drive towards.

### Open-source project internship

General goals of this internship are:

1. Identify and help an open-source project move from a non-GitLab SCM to GitLab
1. Identify a GitLab-hosted open-source project that would benefit from
  security scanning.
1. Integrate various GitLab security scanners into the projects CI pipelines.
1. Contribute patches and fixes for identified vulnerabilities.
1. File bug reports and commit small enhancements to GitLab scanners.
1. Write a report and create collateral detailing their experience and the
  steps above.

### Product Manager shadow internship

General goals of this internship are:

1. Become familiar with the Product Development Lifecycle and how development is done at GitLab.
1. Become familiar with user research, including how Problem and/or Solution validation is done at GitLab.
1. Become familiar with the relevant group's product strategy and with how prioritization is done. Although the Product Manager remains the DRI for product priorities, interns are encouraged to openly share their insights on the priorities along with the rationale for their thoughts.
1. Perform one or more of the following:
1. Under the guidance of the mentor, lead research in a Problem Validation cycle to gather information about user needs.  The intern will conclude by proposing next steps to be taken along with creating issues/epics for any relevant product improvements.
1. Under the guidance of the mentor, collaborate with a Product Designer to define the requirements and user experience for a feature.  The intern will be responsible for taking this feature through planning breakdown and working with the engineering team on the execution of the feature.
1. Under the guidance of the mentor, do extensive competitive, market, and analyst research to refine our product strategy.  The intern will be responsible for proposing updates to direction pages to better describe our competitive position and our strategy to prioritize development in a way that optimizes the value we provide to our users.
1. Write a report and create collateral detailing their experience and the
  steps above.

**Shadow intern track**

1. Helps inform and evangelize the capabilities of the Secure and Govern stages to other departments in the company.

**Both**

1. Ability to identify and hire exceptional interns.
1. Provides valuable feedback that can help drive better product decisions.

### For the mentor

1. Get direct access to an "end-user" to better understand their perspective
  and challenges.
1. Get practice acting as a mentor and coach.

## What to do

This section provides general guidance on what the internship would look like.
It is meant to be demonstrative, not prescriptive, and based on what has worked
for past iterations. The mentor and intern are responsible for setting the
schedule and deliverables that make sense for them.

### Define the goals

At the start of the internship, the mentor and intern should decide what the goals
of the internship are. This should include either a hands-on application of a GitLab
security tool to some open source project or a specific product task to be accomplished
during the allotted time. This is the critical piece that
helps the intern learn, provides GitLab good feedback, and that benefits the
open source project.

Submit your final list of goals to the section leader for approval. The most effective way to do this is to work with your selected mentor and [create an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/new?issue).

### Deliver on the goals

The majority of the internship should be spent *doing*, rather than talking
about doing. To that end, for the open source track, a big piece of the
internship should be spent on working with the open source projects directly,
rather than working with GitLab teams. For the shadow intern track, the intern
should feel free to join any of the Product Manager's regularly scheduled meetings
unless there is a meeting where the PM specifically requests privacy. Shadowing
meetings should be secondary; however, to accomplishing the stated goals.
Priority should be given to meetings that are directly connected with accomplishing those goals.

### Share your experiences

At the end of the internship, the intern should produce some sort of content
about their time in the program and what they did. This could be a blog, a
YouTube video, conference presentation, or anything that is agreed upon. The
goal is to be able to share with others about what was done and give the intern
something tangible they can point to in the future.

### Example schedule

To make the above a bit more concrete, here are some examples of what a four-week
long internship might look like.

| Week | Description |
| 1 | Identify OSS projects to work with, scanners to add, and introduce self to the maintainers. |
| 2 | Write MRs to add scanners to the projects. |
| 3 | Continue with MRs to add scanners to the projects. Start addressing vulnerabilities found by the scanners. |
| 4 | Finalize or handoff any open MRs to maintainers. Write blog about experience. |

| Week | Description |
| 1 | Identify a feature to lead through the development process. Become familiar with relevant direction pages, problem/solution validations, and epics/issues/designs. Ensure the designs are finalized, that the requirements are comprehensive and well written, and that the feature is 100% ready for planning breakdown. |
| 2 | Participate in the weekly group meeting and put the feature through the planning breakdown process. Work with engineers throughout the week to answer questions and iterate on the design as they refine their issues. |
| 3 | Work with the PM to identify customers or users who are likely candidates to be early adopters of the new feature. Share the plans with them and solicit their feedback on future improvements that might be made. |
| 4 | Continue to evangelize the upcoming feature. Write the release post item, inform the PMM, and share with any interested customers or SAs. Write blog about experience. |
