As part of the UN IAEG-SDG's [2020 Comprehensive Review Process](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/2020-comp-rev/), 36 changes to the SDG indicators were recommended. The breakdown of changes include:

- 14 proposals for replacements of existing indicators
- 8 proposals for revisions of existing indicators
- 8 proposals for additional indicators
- 6 proposals for deleting indicators, including the partial deletion of 4.2.1

The UN provides [more information about these changes](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/2020-comprev/UNSC-proposal/).

In order to display the new indicator set on an Open SDG platform, the following changes need to be carried out:

1. Upgrade to Open SDG version 1.4.0 or later. For technical help in upgrading to this v1.4.0, see our [upgrade instructions for 1.4.0](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrades/upgrading-1-4-0/).

    Release 1.4.0 contains the translations for the new indicator set.

2. Make changes to data and metadata files for indicators that were replaced, revised, added or deleted through the review process:

  - For replaced and revised indicators, update the data and metadata accordingly. If the change means you no longer report the indicator, delete the data file.
  - For added indicators, add a metadata file and where data is available, add a data file.
  - For deleted indicators, delete the data and metadata files.
