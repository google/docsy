5.1 The initial term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall expire one (1) year later (the “Initial Term”). After the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year renewal periods (each a “Renewal Term”) unless terminated as set out herein. The Initial Term and any Renewal Terms (if any) shall be the “Term.”

5.2 Following the Initial Term, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to the other Party. Either Party may immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other Party breaches its obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice from the non-breaching Party. A Party that provides notice of breach must include in the notice a description of the alleged breach in reasonable detail.

GitLab will have no obligation or liability resulting from termination or suspension of this Agreement.

### **6. CONFIDENTIALITY**

6.1 “Confidential Information” means the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any other non-public technical or business information of a Party, whether provided orally or in writing, that is designated in writing as “Confidential” or “Proprietary” at the time of disclosure or that due to the nature of the information the receiving Party would reasonably understand it to be confidential information of the disclosing Party, including information relating to a Party’s techniques, ideas, concepts, algorithms, source code, methodologies, workflows, implementation processes, current and future products and services, research, engineering, designs, financial information, procurement requirements, customer lists, business forecasts, roadmaps, marketing plans, pricing, discounts and proposals.

6.2 Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public through no fault of or breach of this Agreement by the receiving Party; (b) was rightfully in the receiving Party’s possession at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality on the receiving Party; (c) is independently developed by the receiving Party without use of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information; (d) is rightfully obtained by the receiving Party from a third party not under a duty of confidentiality to the disclosing Party and without restriction on use or disclosure; or (e) the receiving Party is permitted to publicly disclose under another provision of this Agreement.

6.3 Neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information of the other Party to anyone or shall use Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose, except in either case as necessary to exercise its rights or obligations under this Agreement (“Permitted Purposes”). Each Party shall use at least the same degree of care (but no less than reasonable care) to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination and copying of the other party’s Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of a like nature. Each Party shall limit the disclosure of such Confidential Information to those of its employees, consultants, Affiliates, advisors and contractors with a bona fide need to access such Confidential Information solely for the Permitted Purposes, and all such employees and contractors must be subject to binding disclosure and use restrictions at least as protective as those set forth herein. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 6 by its employees, consultants, Affiliates’ employees, advisors and contractors, as if they were that Party’s own employees.

6.4 The obligations of confidentiality under this Section 6 shall expire three (3) years after that Confidential Information is disclosed hereunder. The receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy (or in the case of electronic data, use commercially reasonable efforts to delete or render practicably inaccessible by receiving Party) Confidential Information disclosed by the other Party upon its written request.

6.5 This Agreement shall not be construed to prevent the receiving Party from disclosing the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to a court or governmental body pursuant to a valid court order, law, subpoena or regulation, provided that the receiving Party: (a) gives reasonable notice (or such shorter period as is the maximum notice permitted under applicable law) before making the disclosure, unless prohibited by law; (b) provides reasonable assistance to the disclosing Party, at disclosing Party’s expense, in any lawful efforts by the disclosing Party to resist or limit the disclosure of such Confidential Information; and (c) discloses only that portion of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed.

6.6 The Parties agree that the receiving Party’s disclosure of Confidential Information, except as provided herein, may result in irreparable injury for which a remedy in money damages would be inadequate. The Parties further agree that in the event of such disclosure or threatened disclosure: (a) the disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction to prevent the breach or threatened breach in addition to any other remedies available to the disclosing Party at law or in equity; and (b) each Party hereby acknowledges that such an injunction is appropriate and warranted in such case. All Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement will remain the property of the disclosing Party. No license or right under any intellectual property right is granted under this Agreement or by any disclosure of Confidential Information except as expressly stated in this Agreement.

### **10. SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION**

10.1 With respect to the Open Source Project’s use of GitLab Software provided as “Software-as-a-Service”, GitLab shall be responsible for establishing and maintaining a commercially reasonable information security program that is designed to: (i) ensure the security and confidentiality of the Project Content; (ii) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the Project Content; (iii) protect against unauthorized access to, or use of, the Project Content; and (iv) ensure that all subcontractors of GitLab, if any, comply with all of the foregoing. In no case shall the safeguards of GitLab’s information security program be less stringent than the information security safeguards used by GitLab to protect its own commercially sensitive data. The Open Source Project shall use commercially reasonable security and anti-virus measures when accessing and using the GitLab Software and/or the GitLab for Open Source Program materials and to prevent unauthorized access to, or use of the GitLab Software and/or the GitLab for Open Source Program materials, and notify GitLab promptly of any such unauthorized access or use of which it becomes aware.

10.2 The terms of the data processing addendum located at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/data-processing-agreement (“DPA”) are hereby incorporated by reference and shall apply to the extent Project Content includes Personal Data, as defined in the DPA. To the extent Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom and Switzerland are processed by GitLab, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall apply, as further set forth in the DPA. For the purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Open Source Project and its applicable Affiliates are each the data exporter, and the Open Source Projects acceptance of this Agreement shall be treated as its execution of the Standard Contractual Clauses.

10.3 The Parties acknowledge and agree that: (i) the GitLab Software is not designed for the purpose(s) of storing, processing, compiling or transmitting Sensitive Data (as defined herein), and (ii) the Open Source Project shall not use the GitLab Software, or otherwise provide to GitLab without prior written consent, Sensitive Data under this Agreement. “Sensitive Data” means: (i) special categories of data enumerated in European Union Regulation 2016/679, Article 9(1) or any successor legislation; (ii) patient, medical, or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (as amended and supplemented) (“HIPAA”); (iii) credit, debit, or other payment card data or financial account information, including bank account numbers or other personally identifiable financial information; (iv) social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, or other government identification numbers; (v) other information subject to regulation or protection under specific laws such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act or Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) (or related rules or regulations); or (vi) any data similar to the above protected under foreign or domestic laws. The Open Source Project further acknowledges that the GitLab Software and related features are not intended to meet any legal obligations for these uses, including HIPAA and GLBA requirements, and that GitLab is not a Business Associate as defined under HIPAA. Therefore, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, GitLab has no liability for Sensitive Data processed in connection with the Open Source Project’s use of the GitLab Software.

10.4 The Open Source Project shall also maintain and handle all Project Content with reasonably adequate privacy and security measures and in compliance with all applicable privacy laws and regulations.

### **11. GENERAL PROVISIONS**

11.2 Neither Party shall assign, delegate, subcontract or otherwise transfer, directly or by operation of law, any of the rights or obligations of this Agreement nor any part or all of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any attempt to transfer, assign, delegate or subcontract rights or obligations under this Agreement except as set forth in this Section 11.2 shall be void. Subject to the foregoing limitation, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

11.3 A waiver of any right under this Agreement is effective only if it is in writing and signed by the Party against whom the waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall apply only to the circumstances for which it is given. Unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement, remedies arising under this Agreement are cumulative and do not exclude any other remedies available at law or in equity.

11.4 This Agreement is not intended to benefit any person or party other than the Parties to this Agreement and, where applicable, the Parties’ successors and permitted assigns. The Parties are independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a membership, joint venture, agency, employment, or fiduciary relationship between the Parties. Neither Party shall have any right or authority to assume or create any obligation of any kind, express or implied, in the name of or on behalf of the other Party, or represent that it has any such authority. Each Party will be responsible for the costs incurred by it in performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

11.5 Except as expressly otherwise provided herein, all notices shall be in writing and deemed delivered the earlier of: (a) actual receipt; (b) upon delivery by a nationally recognized overnight courier (receipt requested) to the receiving Party’s address as specified herein or updated by written notice; or (c) when received via electronic communications as evidenced by either Party’s contemporaneously created computer records.

11.7 This Agreement and all relations, disputes, claims and other matters arising hereunder (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed exclusively by, and construed exclusively in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflicts of laws provisions. To the extent permitted by law, choice of laws rules and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply. For the purposes of adjudicating any action or proceeding to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, the courts of San Francisco county, California.

11.8 If any provision of this Agreement is judicially declared to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall not have the effect of invalidating or voiding any portion of the remainder of this Agreement, it being the intent and agreement of the Parties that this Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent necessary to render it valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such modification is not possible, by substituting therefor another provision that is valid, legal and enforceable and that achieves the same objective.
