# key best practice

### 1. **create helpful, reliable, people-first content**
- not to gain search engine rankings
1. **self assess your content if helpful and reliable**
    - does the content provide **original information**, roporting, researh or analysis?
    - does the content provide a substantial, complete, or **conmprehensive description** of the topic?
    - does the content provide insightful analysis or interesting information that is **beyond the obvious**?
    - If the content draws on other sources, does it avoid simply copying or rewriting those sources, and instead provide substantial **additional value** and originality?
    - Does the **main heading or page title** provide a descriptive, helpful summary of the content?
    - Does the main heading or page title **avoid exaggerating** or being shocking in nature?
    - Is this the sort of page you'd want to **bookmark**, share with a friend, or recommend?
    - Would you expect to see this content in or **referenced by** a printed magazine, encyclopedia, or book?
    - Does the content provide **substantial value when compared to other pages** in search results?
    - Does the content have any **spelling or stylistic issues**?
    - Is the content **produced well**, or does it appear sloppy or hastily produced?
    - Is the content mass-produced by or outsourced to a large number of creators, or spread across a large network of sites, so that individual pages or sites don't get as much attention or care?
    - Does the content present information in a way that **makes you want to trust it**, such as clear sourcing, evidence of the expertise involved, background about the author or the site that publishes it, such as through links to an author page or a site's **About page**?
    - If someone researched the site producing the content, would they come away with an impression that it is well-trusted or widely-recognized as an authority on its topic?
    - Is this content written or **reviewed by an expert** or enthusiast who demonstrably knows the topic well?
    - Does the content have any **easily-verified factual errors**?
2. **peer assess you content if helpful and reliable**
3. **provide a great page experience**

    - **do your pages have good core web vitals?**

        Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics that Google uses to measure and evaluate a webpage’s user experience, focusing on three main aspects: **loading performance**, **interactivity**, and **visual stability**. These metrics are part of Google's Page Experience signals, and improving them can help enhance SEO by aligning your site with what Google considers a "great page experience."

        Here’s a breakdown of the **Core Web Vitals** metrics and how they impact your pages:

        1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** – *Loading Performance*
            - **What it measures**: LCP tracks the time it takes for the largest visible element on the page (like a main image or large text block) to load.
            - **Goal**: Keep LCP under 2.5 seconds to ensure that pages load quickly for users.
            - **Why it matters**: Faster load times improve user experience, as visitors can access content promptly, reducing bounce rates and increasing user engagement.

        2. **First Input Delay (FID)** – *Interactivity*
            - **What it measures**: FID measures the delay between when a user first interacts with a page (like clicking a button) and when the browser responds.
            - **Goal**: FID should be under 100 milliseconds for optimal responsiveness.
            - **Why it matters**: Quick response times are essential for interactivity, as delays can frustrate users and may lead them to abandon the page.

        3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** – *Visual Stability*
            - **What it measures**: CLS evaluates unexpected layout shifts during page load, like elements moving around due to delayed loading or resizing.
            - **Goal**: Keep CLS under 0.1 to ensure content is stable.
            - **Why it matters**: Visual stability is important because it prevents users from accidentally clicking the wrong elements or losing their place on the page. 

        **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** is a metric that measures how much a webpage's content shifts unexpectedly as it loads. It’s part of Google’s Core Web Vitals and is crucial for evaluating **visual stability**—how reliably elements stay in place during loading. A high CLS score indicates poor user experience, as unexpected shifts can make the page feel unstable and frustrating.

        **How CLS Works**

        CLS calculates layout shifts by assessing how often and by how much elements on the page move as the page loads. This movement can occur when:
        - **Images** without specified dimensions load and push content down.
        - **Ads, banners, or iframes** load and shift surrounding content.
        - **Fonts** load slowly, causing text to change size or style unexpectedly.
        - **Dynamic content** (such as user-generated content or notifications) is added to the page without space allocation.

        **How CLS is Scored**

        CLS is a score ranging from 0 (no shifting) to 1 or more (significant shifting). According to Google, a **good CLS score is 0.1 or lower**, while a score higher than 0.25 is considered poor.

        **Why CLS Matters**

        Poor CLS can be frustrating for users, especially on mobile devices. If content shifts unexpectedly, users might accidentally click the wrong buttons or links, leading to confusion, mistakes, or even causing users to abandon the page.

        **Common Causes of High CLS**

        1. **Images without dimensions**: If images don’t specify width and height in the HTML/CSS, they load dynamically, causing layout shifts.
        2. **Ads and iframes**: Ads that load after the main content can push text or other elements down the page.
        3. **Web fonts**: Fonts that load slowly or change size cause "flash of unstyled text" (FOUT), which can shift content unexpectedly.
        4. **Pop-ups and banners**: Content that appears after the page loads, like banners or pop-ups, can disrupt the layout.

        **How to Reduce CLS**

        - **Set width and height** for images and videos to reserve space.
        - **Reserve space for ads and embeds** so they don’t shift content when loading.
        - **Use a web font loader** to manage font loading and avoid unexpected text shifts.
        - **Add dynamic content below the fold** (the part of the page users don’t see initially) to avoid layout disruption.


    **Why Core Web Vitals Matter for SEO**
    Google uses Core Web Vitals as part of its ranking criteria, meaning that pages with good scores on these metrics are more likely to rank higher in search results. This makes them important for SEO, as pages that offer a smooth and responsive experience align with Google’s focus on user satisfaction.

    **How to Improve Core Web Vitals**
    To optimize Core Web Vitals, you can:
    - Minimize and defer large images and resources for faster loading.
    - Optimize JavaScript to reduce blocking elements.
    - Use techniques like lazy loading and caching.
    - Monitor performance regularly with tools like **Google PageSpeed Insights** or **Lighthouse**.

    - **are your pages served in a secure fashion?**

    Serving pages securely is essential for building trust with users and improving your site's SEO. Google prioritizes secure sites in search rankings, so implementing secure practices is a key part of a strong web presence.

    ### Steps to Ensure Secure Page Delivery

    1. **Use HTTPS**
    - **What it is**: HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) encrypts data between the user’s browser and your website, protecting it from interception or tampering.
    - **How to implement**: Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a reputable certificate authority (CA) and configure it on your server. Many hosting providers offer free SSL certificates (such as Let’s Encrypt) and make setup easy.
    - **Why it matters**: HTTPS is a ranking factor for Google, and users feel more comfortable browsing sites with HTTPS, especially when entering personal information.

    2. **Ensure Secure Cookies**
    - **What it is**: Cookies can store session and user data, but if they’re not secure, they can be intercepted in transit.
    - **How to implement**: Use the `Secure` attribute on cookies to ensure they’re only sent over HTTPS connections. Additionally, set cookies to `HttpOnly` to prevent access by client-side scripts, reducing exposure to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

    3. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**
    - **What it is**: A CSP is a security feature that helps prevent cross-site scripting and other code injection attacks by specifying which resources (e.g., scripts, images) are allowed to load on your site.
    - **How to implement**: Configure CSP headers in your server settings to allow only trusted domains to load resources. For example, setting policies like `script-src 'self'` ensures that only scripts from your domain are executed.
    - **Why it matters**: CSP can greatly reduce vulnerabilities and potential threats, especially when external resources are involved.

    4. **Use Secure Headers**
    - **What they are**: Secure HTTP headers provide additional security by setting browser behavior for your site.
    - **Common headers**:
        - `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`: Forces browsers to connect only via HTTPS.
        - `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type than declared.
        - `X-Frame-Options`: Prevents your site from being embedded in iframes, reducing the risk of clickjacking attacks.
        - `X-XSS-Protection`: Enables browser-based XSS protection.
    - **How to implement**: Set these headers on your server. Many frameworks and content delivery networks (CDNs) also support them.
    - **Why it matters**: These headers offer an additional layer of security against common vulnerabilities.

    5. **Regularly Monitor and Update Software**
    - **What it is**: Ensuring your web server, CMS, plugins, and other tools are updated reduces the risk of vulnerabilities.
    - **How to implement**: Use the latest versions of software and plugins, and remove unused plugins or components. Schedule regular audits to check for updates.
    - **Why it matters**: Outdated software is a common target for attackers. Regular updates ensure your site stays secure and compliant with the latest standards.

    6. **Secure User Authentication and Sessions**
    - **What it is**: Enforcing strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and session expiration for logged-in users.
    - **How to implement**: Require strong passwords, offer two-factor authentication, and implement session timeouts for inactive sessions.
    - **Why it matters**: Securing user authentication ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive areas of your site.

    - **does your content display well on mobile devices?**

        **Google’s mobile-first indexing** means that the mobile version of your site is the primary version it considers for search rankings.

    - **does your content avoid using an excessive amount of ads that distract from or interfere with the main content**

    minimizing and optimizing the use of ads is essential to keep users engaged and ensure a positive user experience. Google and other search engines prioritize content that provides value without overwhelming users with intrusive or excessive advertising. Here’s why it’s important and some guidelines to avoid ad overload:

### Why Limiting Ads Matters
1. **Improves User Experience**: Excessive ads, particularly those that are distracting, can frustrate users, leading to higher bounce rates and less engagement.
2. **Enhances SEO**: Google’s Page Experience update penalizes pages with intrusive ads, which can negatively impact your search rankings.
3. **Increases Content Focus**: When users can focus on your main content without distractions, it improves their experience and can lead to longer session times.

### Best Practices for Ad Placement and Frequency

1. **Limit Above-the-Fold Ads**
   - Avoid filling the area users see first with too many ads. This area should focus on key content or navigation to immediately engage visitors.

2. **Use Non-Intrusive Ad Formats**
   - **Avoid pop-ups** and large interstitial ads, as they can block content and frustrate users. Instead, use smaller, less intrusive banners or sidebars.
   - Consider native ads, which are designed to blend in with the content and are less distracting.

3. **Optimize Ad Load for Mobile**
   - Make sure ads load quickly and are optimized for smaller screens, keeping ad sizes manageable and well-spaced on mobile devices.
   - Avoid ads that take up too much screen space on mobile, and ensure any ads displayed are easily dismissible.

4. **Limit the Number of Ads Per Page**
   - Balance your content-to-ad ratio by limiting the total number of ads. Too many ads can overwhelm the user, particularly in content-heavy areas.
   - Aim for a balance where ads enhance monetization without detracting from the readability and flow of your content.

5. **Avoid Disruptive Animation or Autoplay**
   - Avoid ads with loud animations or autoplaying videos, as they distract from content and can be particularly frustrating on mobile or slower connections.

6. **Ensure Ads are Relevant and Non-Deceptive**
   - Use ads that are relevant to your audience. This creates a more seamless experience and reduces the likelihood of users feeling "tricked" or misled.
   - Avoid deceptive ads that mimic download buttons or system notifications, as these are penalized by Google and can harm user trust.

    ### Tools for Monitoring Ad Impact on UX
    - **Google PageSpeed Insights**: This can alert you to ads that may affect Core Web Vitals (like LCP and CLS), which are critical for user experience and SEO.
    - **Heatmaps**: Tools like Hotjar can show where users are engaging with or avoiding ads, helping you optimize placement without overwhelming users.
    - **User Feedback**: Collecting feedback can help you understand if users find the ads on your site intrusive or distracting.

    ### Summary
    Striking the right balance with ads enhances user experience, helps maintain good SEO, and makes users more likely to stay engaged with your content. Adopting these practices can help you achieve a seamless, ad-supported experience that doesn’t interfere with the main content.

    - **do your pages avoid using intusive intersitials?**

        avoiding intrusive interstitials (large pop-ups or overlays that cover the main content) is crucial for a positive user experience and can positively impact SEO. Google penalizes sites that use intrusive interstitials, especially on mobile, because they interfere with the user’s ability to quickly access content. Here’s why it’s important and how to avoid intrusive interstitials:

### Why Avoiding Intrusive Interstitials Matters
1. **Improves Accessibility**: Interstitials can block or obscure content, frustrating users and often leading them to leave the page.
2. **Boosts SEO**: Google’s Page Experience update specifically discourages intrusive interstitials, so avoiding them can help maintain or improve your search rankings.
3. **Enhances Mobile Experience**: On mobile, interstitials can be particularly disruptive, as they often cover most of the small screen, making it hard for users to dismiss them.

### Best Practices for Non-Intrusive Interstitials

1. **Use Smaller Banners or Pop-Ups**
   - Instead of a full-screen interstitial, use smaller banners or slide-ins that appear at the top or bottom of the screen. These allow users to see the content while still getting the message.

2. **Delay Pop-Ups and Avoid Immediate Load**
   - Give users a chance to engage with your content before displaying any pop-ups or offers. An immediate interstitial can frustrate users before they’ve had a chance to start reading.

3. **Make Interstitials Easy to Dismiss**
   - Ensure that any interstitial or pop-up has a clearly visible “Close” or “X” button, so users can easily remove it and continue reading.
   - Avoid deceptive designs where the close button is hidden or difficult to see, as this can frustrate users and harm the user experience.

4. **Limit the Use of Pop-Ups on Mobile**
   - Google has specific guidelines against interstitials that cover a significant portion of the screen on mobile. Use only minimal pop-ups on mobile, and prioritize content-first design.

5. **Use Non-Intrusive Formats for Legal Requirements**
   - For messages required by law (such as cookie consent or age verification), keep the design minimal. Banner-style notifications at the top or bottom of the page work well and allow users to continue viewing the main content.

6. **Consider Exit Intent Pop-Ups on Desktop Only**
   - If you want to display a pop-up with an offer or newsletter sign-up, use exit intent technology to show it only when a user is about to leave. This is less intrusive than displaying it immediately, and it’s typically better suited for desktop.

    ### Summary
    By following these practices, you can create an experience that is both user-friendly and compliant with Google’s guidelines. Users will appreciate a seamless browsing experience without interruptions, and Google rewards sites that avoid intrusive interstitials by ranking them more favorably in search results.

    - **is your page designed so visitors can easily distinguish the main content form other content on you page?**

    designing a page so visitors can easily distinguish the main content from other elements (like ads, navigation, or sidebars) is critical for both user experience and SEO. Clear visual hierarchy and a well-structured layout help users navigate the page effortlessly, leading to higher engagement and satisfaction.

### Best Practices for Ensuring Main Content is Clear

1. **Use Clear Layout and Structure**
   - **What it is**: Organize your content with a clean and logical layout. Main content should be prominently displayed, usually in the center of the page, with other elements like ads or sidebars placed on the periphery.
   - **How to implement**: 
     - Use a **two-column** layout with the main content in the larger column and secondary content (like ads or related articles) in the sidebar.
     - Keep consistent **margins** and **padding** to separate different sections.
     - Use **headings**, **subheadings**, and **bullet points** to break down content and make it scannable.

2. **Establish a Strong Visual Hierarchy**
   - **What it is**: Visual hierarchy guides users’ attention to the most important parts of the page first. The main content should stand out clearly from other elements.
   - **How to implement**: 
     - Use **larger fonts** for the main headings (H1) and important text.
     - Apply **contrast** to make key content stand out (e.g., dark text on a light background).
     - Differentiate sections using **background colors** or **borders** to visually group related content.
   
3. **Ensure Good Contrast and Readability**
   - **What it is**: High contrast between text and background makes it easier to read and focus on the content.
   - **How to implement**: 
     - Use dark text on light backgrounds or light text on dark backgrounds for readability.
     - Avoid low-contrast text (e.g., light gray on white) which can be hard to read, especially on mobile devices.
   
4. **Visual Cues for Ads or Secondary Content**
   - **What it is**: Ads and secondary content should be visually distinct from the main content to avoid confusion and improve clarity.
   - **How to implement**: 
     - Use a **lighter background** for ads or sidebars to differentiate them from the main content area.
     - Label ads or sponsored content clearly (e.g., with an "Ad" or "Sponsored" label).
     - **Spacing** is key—avoid cluttering the page with too many ads around the content area.

5. **Ensure Consistent Branding and Design**
   - **What it is**: The main content should feel like it belongs to the overall site design. Clear branding and consistent design help users identify and engage with content easily.
   - **How to implement**: 
     - Use your brand’s color palette and typography for headings and text to create a cohesive design.
     - Make sure the main content is not crowded by excessive decoration or graphics that compete for attention.

6. **Mobile-Friendly Design**
   - **What it is**: On mobile devices, it’s especially important to ensure that the main content remains front and center, with secondary elements properly adjusted for smaller screens.
   - **How to implement**: 
     - Use a **single-column layout** for mobile views, ensuring the main content is front and center.
     - Optimize buttons and links for touch interaction with enough space around them to avoid accidental clicks.

### Tools and Techniques to Test and Ensure Readability
- **Google Mobile-Friendly Test**: This tool shows you how your site looks on mobile devices, helping you ensure the main content is easily distinguishable.
- **Heatmaps (e.g., Hotjar, Crazy Egg)**: These tools track user interactions and can help you see which areas of the page users engage with most, highlighting whether the main content is receiving attention.
- **A/B Testing**: Testing different layouts and designs with real users can help you determine what works best for making the main content stand out.

### Summary
By using a clear, structured layout with good visual hierarchy, contrast, and distinct ad placement, you can ensure that visitors can easily identify and focus on the main content of your page. This not only improves user experience but also enhances your site’s SEO, as Google values user engagement and page clarity.
