## Industry Analyst Relations at GitLab

Industry Analyst Relations (IAR) is generally considered to be a corporate strategy, communications and marketing activity, but at GitLab, because of our mission that everyone can contribute, we view the industry analyst community as participants as well. The primary owner/DRI of Industry Analyst Relations (including but not limited to relationships, communication, coordination, research participation, and contractual arrangements with industry analysts and their respective firms) at GitLab is Portfolio Marketing. This is in order to provide the most accurate, consistent, and comprehensive perspective on GitLab to industry analysts and to enable receiving the same from industry analysts.

If you would like to engage the analysts (e.g. research a topic, ask questions of an analyst, request analyst reports, brief an analyst) please click [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/strategic-marketing/product-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=AR-ResearchRequest) for the research request form.

## How we interact with the analyst community

Examples of how we engage with analysts include:

- Briefings to update analysts on our product, our company, and our future direction
- Inquiries where analysts answer specific questions we have about product strategy, messaging, competitive positioning
- Advisory days for a deeper dive into the products, markets, and strategies
- Responding to analyst RFIs in support of comparative analyst research such as Forrester Waves, Gartner Magic Quadrants, and IDC MarketScapes
- Collaborating on market research products, surveys, sales enablement tools, etc.
- Providing an analyst newsletter to update analysts on what GitLab is doing between briefings
- Promoting analyst reports that feature GitLab to help enhance or clarify our story for customers, prospects, and partners
- Inviting analysts to participate in webinars, speaking engagements, media engagement, and other events where an analyst presence would be beneficial

## How we on-board a new analyst to the GitLab Analyst Relations community

- Open an issue in the Product Marketing project using the Analyst On-boarding template that details:
  - what they cover
  - alignment with internal use cases and technology areas
  - plan for engagement
- Set them up in ARInsights, the third party analyst-tracking software we use
- Add them to the appropriate analyst newsletter distribution list
- Add them to the appropriate use case profile(s)

## How we off-board an analyst from the GitLab Analyst Relations community

- Open an issue in the Product Marketing project using the Analyst Off-boarding template that details:
  - Identify their reason for off-boarding, including departure or change or coverage
  - Identify who is their short-term/long-term replacement
  - Remove them from ARInsights distribution lists
  - Remove them from the appropriate use case profile(s)
  - Notify the product management and product marketing teams

## How We Conduct Industry Analyst Inquiries

[How We Conduct Industry Analyst Inquiries](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/analyst-relations/ar-inquiry/)

## How we incorporate Use Cases into our industry analyst interactions

- An initial round of inquiries to explore and get input into market requirements, target personas, etc. for a given use case
- Ongoing briefings to provide updates on progress made within the scope of a given use case
- Subsequent inquiry calls to revisit market requirements, competitive positioning, etc. as updated to meet evolving market conditions

## Responding to requests to participate in industry analyst comparison research

- GitLab evaluates participation in industry analyst comparative research to which we are invited based in large part on how well we meet the qualification criteria and how we are likely to score for strategy/vision. When participating, we are committed to providing our best possible answers for the questionnaires.
- The teams responsible for answering the questionnaire will make this a priority. We will:

  - Present every feature in the best possible light so we have the most defensible chance at high scores.
  - Provide whatever evidence we can that illustrates our current and future capability to address the market needs identified by the analysts.
  - When responding to the analyst request, challenge ourselves to find a way to honestly, unhesitatingly say "yes" and paint the product in the best light possible. We carefully work to understand specific feature and capability descriptions that often make up inclusion, exclusion and even evaluation criteria. If, at first glance we think we may not or do not support a specific feature or capability as described, we will take a deeper, second look at the requirement and look to see if there is a way that our existing features solve the problem at hand.
  - Present our overall solution within the context of the entirety of a specific, defined market, meaning these exercises are bake-offs; we are being evaluated in comparison to everyone else rather than in comparison to an ideal world. We should take into account the competitive landscape as we craft our position and support it.
  - Our demo should be viewed as a further proof point of our solution and a way to demonstrate things we might not be able to illustrate or otherwise communicate the way we'd like to in the questionnaire response.

## Process for responding to industry analyst comparison research

### Before the questionnaire arrives

- GitLab AR is aware of what industry analyst research comparing vendors and/or their products (e.g. Magic Quadrants (MQs), Waves, etc.) we may be asked to participate in, particularly if we have done so before.  AR should be checking with Forrester/Gartner to see if
  - A MQ or Wave or similar comparative research is likely to be repeated
  - The likely time frame for that comparative research (MQ, Wave, etc.) to begin
- Once the timeline is determined, 30-45 days in advance AR will
  - Set up an inquiry with the lead analyst(s) to discuss customer inquiries they have received on this topic over the last year and gain insight on where they think the market is at currently
  - Set up a short (30 minute) demo on the relevant part of GitLab to have them aware of our present position
- GitLab usually receives notice 1-2 weeks in advance that a Wave or MQ is forthcoming, in which they can participate.
  - With Forrester, the process may begin with a Now Tech report.  With Gartner, this process may begin with a Market Guide. It may also begin earlier, with an analyst asking for a meeting to discuss what we see in the market.  This happened for example with Chris Condo of Forrester in 2019 with CI.
  - AR works with PMM team to determine lead PMM, lead TMM and lead PM for the project.
  - AR notifies Customer Reference that a request is imminent.
  - If it is a Gartner MQ, AR will work with the Peer Review team to make sure GitLab reviews are being collected by the Peer Insights team or to get that activated, and coordinate with Peer Review and Customer Reference to funnel references to the appropriate Peer Insights page.

Most analyst companies charge for access to their reports.

- If GitLab purchases reprint rights to a report, then that link will be available here, on the [Analyst Research web page](https://about.gitlab.com/analysts/), and on the relevant product page. Reprint rights are the rights to share the link to the report - these generally last six months to one year.

## Analyst reports that can help you deepen your knowledge

### Forrester Total Economic Impact<sup>TM</sup> of GitLab

In 2020, GitLab commissioned Forrester Research to create a Total Economic Impact (TEI) study on GitLab. According to Forrester, "The TEI methodology quantifiably measures the business value of an IT decision or project. TEI is composed of four main elements with associated tools and methodologies for quantification. Individually, each provides only a piece of the decision-support puzzle. Together, they provide a holistic tool for assessing and justifying IT investments."

In Forrester's methodology, the four main elements of the TEI are:

- Benefits -  measure financial impacts of positive business results.

- Cost - measures the negative impact on IT and the business.

- Risk - quantifies the impact of inherent uncertainties.

- Flexibility - monetizes the value of future options.
