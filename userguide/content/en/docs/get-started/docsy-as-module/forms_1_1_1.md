## What are ticket forms

Ticket forms are the forms utilized by the user to create tickets (when using the web UI). These then translate the responses on the form into ticket metadata.

These fall into one of two types:

- Public - meaning both agents and end-users can see these
- Internal - meaning only agents can see these
