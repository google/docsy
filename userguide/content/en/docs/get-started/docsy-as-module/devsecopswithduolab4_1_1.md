> Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes

## Objectives

GitLab Duo extends beyond just code generation. GitLab Duo can support you through any stage of the DevSecOps lifecycle! In this lab, you will see how GitLab Duo can work with issues and merge requests inside of a project.

## Task A. Using Code Suggestions to Write a New Function

1. Navigate to your GitLab Duo Principles Project.

1. Select **Edit > Web IDE**.

1. Select the `main.go` file.

1. Between the `main` function and `import` block, type the following comment:

   ```text
   // write a function called random_gitlab that pulls a random word from a list and returns it as a string.
   ```

1. Press enter and note the small Tanuki icon that appears in the code margin. Wait until code appears. Once you see code, press Tab.

1. Call your new function in the `main()` function as part of the new `myFigure` object.

1. After doing this, your code should look similar to this:

   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "github.com/common-nighthawk/go-figure"
   )

   // write a function called random_gitlab that pulls a random word from a list and returns it as a string

   var words = []string{"gitlab", "repository", "commit", "branch", "merge", "issue", "pipeline"}

   func random_gitlab() string {
       return words[rand.Intn(len(words))]
   }

   func main() {
       myFigure := figure.NewFigure(random_gitlab(), "", true)
       myFigure.Print()
   }
   ```

   > By nature, the prompt we entered will generate different code for most users, since we asked for random words from a list. If you see different words in the `words :=` definition, that is ok.

1. The function added by GitLab Duo requires the `math/rand` package. Below the `go-figure` import, start typing `math`. Note the Tanuki icon showing code generation in progress.

1. Once you see `math/rand` appear, press **Tab**. Your code should now look similar to this:

   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "github.com/common-nighthawk/go-figure"
       "math/rand"
   )

   // write a function called random_gitlab that pulls a random word from a list and returns it as a string

   var words = []string{"gitlab", "repository", "commit", "branch", "merge", "issue", "pipeline"}

   func random_gitlab() string {
       return words[rand.Intn(len(words))]
   }

   func main() {
       myFigure := figure.NewFigure(random_gitlab(), "", true)
       myFigure.Print()
   }
   ```

## Task B. Generating Code Tests

> The code generated by the GitLab Duo is likely correct, however it is still best practice to test the code for errors before using it in any production environment. Luckily, GitLab Duo can also help us with the test generation process!

1. Highlight all of the code in the `func random_gitlab() string` function.

1. Select the Tanuki icon in the left sidebar.

1. Type the prompt `/tests`. You will receive some tests similar to below:

   ```go
   func TestRandomGitlab(t *testing.T) {

       // Test that it returns one of the words in the slice
       word := random_gitlab()
       words := []string{"hello", "world", "random", "gitlab"}
       contains := false
       for _, w := range words {
           if w == word {
               contains = true
               break
           }
       }
       if !contains {
           t.Errorf("returned word %s not in expected list", word)
       }

       // Test that it returns different words if called multiple times
       word1 := random_gitlab()
       word2 := random_gitlab()
       if word1 == word2 {
           t.Error("returned same word twice in a row")
       }
   }
   ```

   > As always, feel free to use `/explain` to understand what this code is doing.

1. To add the tests to your project, create a new file named `gitlabrandom_test.go`.

1. At the top of the file include the following:

   ```go
   package main

   import "testing"
   ```

1. Paste the generated tests.

1. Select Source Control, then select **Commit to main**.

1. Select **Go to Project** to return to your project.

## Task C. Run tests in a CI/CD pipeline

1. Navigate to **Build > Pipeline editor**.

1. In the `stages` section, add a new stage called `test`.

1. Under the `build app` job create a new job called `test`.

1. Add the `go test` command to run the tests. Your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file will look like the following:

   ```yml
   stages:
       - build
       - test

   default:
       image: golang:latest

   build app:
       stage: build
       script:
           - go get github.com/common-nighthawk/go-figure
           - go run main.go

   test:
       stage: test
       script:
           - go get github.com/common-nighthawk/go-figure
           - go test ./...
   ```

You should now have a pipeline that passed the tests. If a job failed, feel free to use **Root Cause Analysis** to troubleshoot any errors.
