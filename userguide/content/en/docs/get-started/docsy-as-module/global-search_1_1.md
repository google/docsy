This document is a work-in-progress and represents a very early state of the
Cells design. Significant aspects are not documented, though we expect to add
them in the future. This is one possible architecture for Cells, and we intend to
contrast this with alternatives before deciding which approach to implement.
This documentation will be kept even if we decide not to implement this so that
we can document the reasons for not choosing this approach.
{{% /alert %}}

When we introduce multiple Cells we intend to isolate all services related to those Cells.
This will include Elasticsearch which means our current global search functionality will not work.
It may be possible to implement aggregated search across all Cells, but it is unlikely to be performant to do fan-out searches across all Cells especially once you start to do pagination which requires setting the correct offset and page number for each search.

## 1. Definition

## 2. Data flow

## 3. Proposal

Likely the first versions of Cells will not support global searches.
Later, we may consider if building global searches to support popular use cases is worthwhile.

## 4. Evaluation

## 4.1. Pros

## 4.2. Cons
