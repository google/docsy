Brand Voice 

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Tone by Context

While our voice remains consistent, tone varies depending on content type and audience:

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Language Do's & Don'ts

Do:

- Use British English spelling consistently (e.g. “organisation”, “favour”).

- Prioritise inclusive language that avoids bias (e.g. use “they” instead of “he/she”).

- Write in active voice: “We support partners” not “Partners are supported by us”.

- Be optimistic and future-oriented.

- Explain acronyms or specialist terms on first mention.

Don’t:

- Use unnecessary jargon, unless your audience expects it and it's defined.

- Rely on filler phrases like “it goes without saying” or “at the end of the day”.

- Use cliché corporate-speak (“synergy”, “think outside the box”).

- Assume prior knowledge without context.

- Oversell or make unverified claims.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Tone Shifts for Audience Personas

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Style Consistency

- Follow the Green Orbit Glossary for key terms and definitions.

- Refer to the Abbreviations & Acronyms database to avoid inconsistency.

- Titles and headings should follow sentence case, unless branding requires Title Case.

- Numbers from one to nine are written as words; 10 and above as digits.

- Use Oxford commas in lists for clarity.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

# Chapter 4: Format, Structure & Layout Guidelines

This chapter provides guidance on how to format and structure content to maintain consistency, readability, and aesthetic harmony across all Green Orbit Digital communications. Whether it's a webpage, blog post, report, or social media update, this section ensures that our content is not only well-written but also presented in a clear, engaging, and professional manner.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## General Layout Principles

- Alignment: Left-align text for all body content. Avoid justified text as it creates uneven spacing.

- Font: Use Arial (for body text) and Montserrat (for headings and subheadings). Consistently maintain font size and style across similar content types.

- Line Spacing: Set line spacing to 1.5 for body text to ensure readability.

- Margins: Ensure all pages have a uniform margin of 1 inch (2.54 cm) on all sides for printed documents or digital reports.

- Colour Scheme: Follow the approved brand colour palette for any backgrounds, headings, and links. Avoid using more than two accent colours in a single document unless necessary.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Headings & Subheadings

To ensure a clear structure for readers, use headings and subheadings consistently. They help break up content, making it easier to scan.

- H1: Used for the title of the document (usually only one per page).

- H2: Used for primary sections (e.g. Introduction, Key Findings).

- H3: Used for subsections under each primary section (e.g. Methodology, Conclusion).

- H4: Used for minor subsections (if needed) or lists.

### Examples:

- H1: Space Sustainability: Challenges & Solutions

- H2: 1. Introduction

- H3: 1.1. The Role of Space in Addressing Climate Change

- H4: 1.1.1. Satellite Data for Environmental Monitoring

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Paragraphs & Sentence Structure

- Length: Keep paragraphs between 3-5 sentences for readability. Break longer paragraphs into smaller chunks.

- Sentences: Aim for 15-20 words per sentence on average. Too many long sentences can overwhelm the reader.

- Bulleted Lists: Use bulleted or numbered lists for clarity, especially when presenting multiple ideas or steps.

### Example (for bullet points):

- Sustainable space initiatives can reduce the carbon footprint of space missions.

- Space-based data is key to monitoring climate change in real-time.

- Collaborative efforts between space agencies and environmental NGOs drive impact.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Call to Action (CTA)

Every piece of content should have a clear, purposeful call to action (CTA). Whether it’s engaging the audience on social media or prompting further reading, a CTA should be easy to identify.

- CTA Design: CTA buttons or links should be bold, distinct, and action-oriented.

- CTA Placement: Place CTAs prominently, such as at the end of articles, reports, and email newsletters.

- CTA Examples:

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Writing for the Web

When writing for web-based platforms (e.g. websites, blog posts, and social media), the structure must be optimised for online reading:

- Shorter Paragraphs: Online readers scan content, so break up long blocks of text.

- Headings & Subheadings: Use clear, descriptive headings and subheadings to guide the reader’s eye.

- SEO: Integrate relevant keywords naturally throughout the content without overstuffing. Ensure meta descriptions and alt texts for images are relevant to the content.

- Hyperlinks: Use descriptive anchor text instead of generic terms like “click here” (e.g. “Learn more about our sustainability efforts”).

- Multimedia: When applicable, use images, infographics, and videos to break up text and add visual interest. Ensure alt text is used for all images.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Reports & Whitepapers

Reports and whitepapers need to follow a professional, structured format:

- Cover Page: Include the title, date, and authors.

- Table of Contents: For reports longer than 3 pages, include a Table of Contents for easy navigation.

- Sections:

- References: Cite all sources of data or quotes clearly at the end, using footnotes or a reference list.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Social Media

Social media posts need to be brief, engaging, and visually appealing:

- Character Count: For platforms like Twitter, aim for 80-120 characters. For Facebook or LinkedIn, up to 200-300 characters is ideal.

- Tone: Maintain an enthusiastic, engaging, and action-oriented tone. Use appropriate hashtags, mentions, and emojis (sparingly).

- Visuals: Include images, GIFs, or infographics when possible to catch attention.

### Example Social Media Post:

<!-- Unsupported block type: quote -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Email Newsletters

Email newsletters should be clean and concise:

- Subject Line: Keep it under 60 characters, clearly indicating the value (e.g., “Space Sustainability Updates – New Insights & Initiatives”).

- Introduction: Provide a compelling preview of the content, with a brief summary of the main points.

- Body: Break into digestible sections, using bullet points or short paragraphs.

- Call to Action: End with a clear CTA (e.g., “Read more”, “Subscribe now”, “Get involved”).

# Chapter 5: Inclusive & Ethical Language

This chapter focuses on the importance of using inclusive, ethical, and respectful language in all Green Orbit Digital communications. We are committed to fostering an environment of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and our language should reflect this commitment. This chapter provides guidance on how to communicate responsibly and ensure our content resonates with a wide range of audiences while upholding our values of sustainability and ethical practices.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Core Principles of Inclusive & Ethical Language

### 1. Respect and Sensitivity

- Acknowledge Diversity: Use language that respects and acknowledges the diversity of people, cultures, and communities. Avoid stereotypes and assumptions about gender, race, ethnicity, ability, and other characteristics.

- Be Mindful of Power Dynamics: Recognise and address power imbalances in society, especially when discussing issues of sustainability, inequality, or environmental justice.

- Use Person-First Language: Prioritise the person, not the condition or characteristic. For example, use “person with a disability” instead of “disabled person” or “person with lived experience of mental health challenges” instead of “mentally ill person.”

### 2. Gender-Inclusive Language

- Gender-Neutral Terms: Avoid gender-specific terms where possible. For instance, use “they/them” instead of “he/she” when the gender of an individual is not known, and use “chair” or “facilitator” instead of “chairman” or “chairwoman.”

- Pronouns: Respect individuals’ preferred pronouns. If you are unsure, use the person’s name, or refer to them with “they/them” until clarification is given.

- Collective Terms: Use inclusive language for groups, such as “everyone” or “people” instead of gendered terms like “guys” or “ladies and gentlemen.”

### 3. Disability-Aware Language

- Focus on the Individual: Emphasise what an individual can do rather than focusing solely on their disability. For example, “person with mobility challenges” rather than “a wheelchair-bound person.”

- Avoid Ableist Language: Do not use terms that may be considered offensive or demeaning to individuals with disabilities. For example, avoid terms like “crazy,” “insane,” or “lame.”

- Use Preferred Terms: The disability community prefers specific terms such as “deaf” rather than “hearing-impaired” or “autistic person” instead of “person with autism.” Be aware of the terminology preferences within different communities.

### 4. Culturally Sensitive Language

- Avoid Stereotypes: Ensure that the language used does not perpetuate harmful stereotypes about any culture, ethnic group, or nationality.

- Accurate Representation: When referencing specific cultures, countries, or groups, be accurate and respectful. If possible, consult individuals from those communities or sources that accurately represent them.

- Terminology: Be cautious about using terms that may have different meanings or connotations across cultures. For example, terms like “third world” or “underdeveloped” are outdated and can be seen as condescending. Opt for terms like “Global South” or “developing countries” when appropriate.

### 5. Sustainability and Environmental Justice Language

- Inclusive Terminology: Use language that includes all communities, especially those disproportionately affected by environmental challenges. Recognise that sustainability efforts must be inclusive and equitable.

- Environmental Justice: Acknowledge and respect the fact that environmental degradation and climate change disproportionately affect lower-income and marginalized communities. Phrases like “climate justice” or “environmental justice” should be used to highlight these disparities.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Best Practices for Inclusive & Ethical Language

### 1. Avoiding Harmful Language

- Exclusionary Terms: Avoid words or phrases that exclude or marginalise certain groups. For example, instead of “man-made,” use “human-made” or “artificial.” Similarly, avoid terms like “mankind” and replace them with “humanity” or “humankind.”

- Stigmatising Language: Steer clear of language that may perpetuate stigma or discrimination. For example, instead of “addict,” use “person with a substance use disorder” or “person in recovery.”

### 2. Addressing Race, Ethnicity, and Nationality

- Specificity: When discussing race or ethnicity, be as specific as possible. For example, “Black” and “Latino/a” are more accurate than general terms like “people of colour.”

- Avoiding Generalisations: Avoid making broad statements or assumptions about people based on their race or ethnicity. Focus on individuals and their personal stories, not on their race or background.

- Inclusive Phrasing: Use terms that highlight inclusivity and respect. For example, instead of saying “the minority group,” use “historically underrepresented groups” or “marginalised communities.”

### 3. Language Around Sustainability

- Climate Change: Use terms that accurately represent the global impact of climate change. Instead of saying “global warming,” use “climate change” to reflect the broader scope of the issue.

- Eco-friendly Terms: Use clear, easily understood language when talking about sustainability practices. For example, “sustainable materials,” “carbon neutral,” and “renewable energy” are clear and commonly accepted terms.

### 4. Crisis Language

- Sensitivity: Be sensitive when discussing crises, whether environmental or social. Use terms that show empathy and respect for those affected. For example, instead of saying “victims of climate change,” consider using “communities affected by climate change.”

- Empowering Language: Focus on empowering language that encourages positive change. Rather than focusing solely on destruction, use language that promotes solutions and collective action.

## Examples of Inclusive & Ethical Language in Action

### Before:

“By 2030, we aim to eliminate waste produced by developing nations.”

### After:

“By 2030, we aim to eliminate waste through sustainable practices, focusing on global cooperation to support all nations in reducing waste.”

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### Before:

“The poor and uneducated often suffer the most from environmental degradation.”

### After:

“Communities facing socioeconomic challenges and limited access to education are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation.”

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### Before:

“Climate change is primarily an issue for third-world countries.”

### After:

“Climate change is a global issue, with the most vulnerable populations, including those in developing nations, facing the greatest challenges.”

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Monitoring & Evaluation

Inclusive and ethical language is not a one-time effort but an ongoing process. We recommend the following practices to ensure our communications remain responsible:

- Review: All public-facing content should be reviewed by at least two people—one who is familiar with inclusivity and ethical language principles and one with subject matter expertise.

- Feedback: Encourage feedback from diverse stakeholders, including marginalized communities, to ensure our language remains relevant and respectful.

- Regular Training: Provide regular training for team members on inclusive language practices to maintain awareness and sensitivity.

# Chapter 6: Tone, Voice & Brand Personality

This chapter defines the tone, voice, and brand personality of Green Orbit Digital across all communication channels. It ensures that every message reflects who we are, what we stand for, and how we want to be perceived. Whether it’s a blog post, social media caption, proposal, or internal update, our voice should remain recognisable, consistent, and aligned with our values.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Our Brand Voice

Green Orbit Digital’s Brand Voice is the unique combination of our tone, language, and values expressed through communication. Our voice should always be:

- Knowledgeable, not arrogant – We are experts, but we remain approachable and never condescending.

- Optimistic, not naive – We champion hope and action while acknowledging real-world complexities.

- Empowering, not forceful – We aim to inspire change, not impose it.

- Creative, not chaotic – We value originality, while keeping messages purposeful and aligned.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Tone: The 4Cs

Our tone may vary slightly depending on context, but it is guided by the following 4Cs framework:

### 1. Clear

- Use plain English. Prioritise simple sentence structures and active voice.

- Avoid unnecessary jargon, but don’t oversimplify technical accuracy.

- If using an acronym or technical term, define it on first use unless it’s well known to the audience.

Example:

Instead of: “Leveraging geospatial datasets to conduct LULC monitoring across diverse ecosystems.”

Use: “We use satellite data to monitor land use and land cover (LULC) across different ecosystems.”

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 2. Concise

- Eliminate redundant words and filler content.

- Each sentence should add value or move the message forward.

- Avoid long introductions. Get to the point.

Example:

Instead of: “In today’s fast-paced and ever-changing world, we believe that making a difference in the space industry is more important than ever.”

Use: “We’re here to make a difference in the space industry—today and for the future.”

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 3. Compelling

- Use storytelling, facts, or bold calls to action to make messages resonate.

- Show how our work impacts people, the planet, or the future.

- Use imagery-rich language to inspire and engage.

Example:

Instead of: “We recently launched our new sustainability toolkit.”

Use: “Your guide to greener missions is here—our new sustainability toolkit is designed to help every organisation take action today.”

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 4. Consistent

- Follow our editorial standards across all formats: headlines, body text, CTAs, and captions.

- Reflect our values: space for sustainability, innovation, inclusivity, and impact.

- Maintain a consistent grammatical style, such as Oxford commas, British English spelling, and inclusive terms.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Tone by Format

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### Instagram Post

- Before: “We planted more trees this week.”

- After: “Another 500 trees in the ground—every pixel of progress counts! #GreenOrbitImpact”

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## Common Voice Pitfalls to Avoid

- Overuse of buzzwords: Avoid empty phrases like “game-changing” or “cutting-edge” unless supported by specifics.

- Generic language: Make it clear how we’re different and why our work matters.

- Corporate clichés: Avoid phrases like “synergy,” “blue sky thinking,” or “paradigm shift.”
