## Standard Channel Practices

For detailed information on GitLab's Channel Partner Program, visit the [Channel Partner Handbook](/handbook/resellers/). Partners must be an Authorized GitLab Partner _and have completed one sales certification_ to transact any GitLab products or services. To achieve authorization, partners must have an executed agreement and meet the requirements of the GitLab Partner Program. Only GitLab partners in good standing may sell GitLab products and services unless specifically approved on a case-by-case basis by the GitLab partner program team. Partners must [sign up](https://partners.gitlab.com/) to be authorized.

### Policy and Process

All [**Partner Co-Sell**](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-co-sell) opportunities require an authorized GitLab Partner(s) to transact the deal. Deal Registration is not applicable for Partner Co-Sell opportunities.
[**Partner Sourced Deal Registration**](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration) opportunities also require an authorized GitLab Partner to transact, and must also be found/created and registered in the [GitLab Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/) (excludes Alliances and GSIs). The applicable GitLab Channel Managers must approve the registered opportunity to qualify for partner program discounts and incentives. Partner Sourced Deal Registration opportunities are either:

1. Net-new to GitLab
2. An upsell/add-on for an existing GitLab customer

An approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration results in `Sales Qualified Source = Partner Generated` on the opportunity.

For more information: [Deal Registration Program Overview](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/#deal-registration-program-overview).

### Billing Account and Billing Account Contact on Partner Account Record

#### Partner Billing Record Creation

Billing Account and billing account Contact records must be created when onboarding a new partner that will be purchasing directly from GitLab. The Partner Manager should take the following action when a new partner has signed the click-through agreement or agreed to a customer MPA:

1. Create a contact record on the partner account that represents the partners accounts payable contact information with naming convention "[Partner Account Name] - Accounts Payable". Ensure the address on the contact record matches the address on the partner account.
2. Chatter `@Billing Ops` on the Partner Account to request a new billing account. Include the following information:
   - Billing Account Company Name
   - Billing Account Contact Name and Email
   - VAT # if applicable

Partner accounts that will transact via distribution do not need a Billing Account or billing account Contact.

More information on billing accounts can be found on the [Billing Operations Handbook Page](/handbook/finance/accounting/finance-ops/billing-ops/).

#### How to Find Partner Billing Records in SFDC and Use for Quoting

The Invoice Owner and Invoice Owner Contact on a partner quote represent the partner's Billing Account and billing account Contact records, respectively.

**Distributors** - GitLab sellers can access the Billing Account and billing account Contact records [for our distributors here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GdXiBtOJm3Kt3aVXRPliEQiZlN0X_uIqU0YNMHZo-VU/edit?usp=sharing).

**Note**, partners that transact via distribution do not need billing records, as the distributor information will be used on the quote.

**Resellers and MSPs** - To find Billing Account and billing account Contact records in SFDC for partners that transact directly with GitLab, first navigate to the Partner Account record.

1. Billing Account - Refer to "Billing Account" in the related list quick links section at the top of the Partner Account record
2. Billing Account Contact - Open the partner's Billing Account and locate the `Sold To Work Email` (i.e., their Accounts Payable email address). Search for this email in SFDC to determine if a contact record already exists under the Partner Account record
   - If there **is** an existing contact record for this email on the partner account, use it as the Invoice Owner Contact for your quote
   - If there **is not** an existing contact record for this email on the partner account, create a new contact record for this email address called "[Partner Name] - Accounts Payable" which you can then use as Invoice Owner Contact on the quote

### Quoting Partner Deals

#### Partner Quoting Requirements

When a deal is being transacted via a Partner, and a discount other than the defined Program discount is being offered, a GitLab quote is **required**. At a minimum, a [Draft Proposal](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#how-to-create-a-draft-proposal) needs to be created and provided to the Partner. Discounted quotes not in SFDC and sent to a Partner are not permitted within any GEO or Sales Segment. This includes providing product and discounted pricing quote details in an email.

#### Partner Quoting Responsibilities

Sales Reps and/or Renewal Managers are [responsible for quoting](/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#what-quotes-can-deal-desk-assist-me-with) and [PO remittance](/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#po-remittance) on all standard GitLab direct and partner opportunities.

#### Partner Quoting Overview and Resources

Creating a partner quote is **very similar** to the process of creating a direct customer quote. There are **only a few minor differences** when quoting via partners, which are documented in the following Deal Desk handbook sections:

- [One-Tier Reseller Direct quotes](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#standard-partnerreseller-quotes)
- [Two-Tier Distributor quotes](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#distributor-quotes)
- [MSP quotes](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#msp-quotes)

Refer to the [Quote Studio Highspot page](https://gitlab.highspot.com/items/63c04679ce74a0ae63ca5e49) for quoting walkthroughs, including the following step-by-step guides specific to partner deals:

- [Quoting Reseller and Distributor Deals](https://gitlab.highspot.com/items/6412421bfb9e0fdf947cc90a)
- [Quoting MSP Deals](https://gitlab.highspot.com/items/641241c62d511fd525a390e1)

Refer to the [partner billing information](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#billing-account-and-billing-account-contact-on-partner-account-record) section of this handbook for guidance on how to create or find partner billing records in SFDC and then use them for quoting.

### Transacting Through Distribution

#### Why Does GitLab Leverage Distribution?

GitLab is building out a global Authorized Distributor network similar to many other tier-one software companies. Distributors bring GitLab, our partners, and our customers several valuable offerings:

- Accelerate market reach with joint growth plans and execution including:
  - recruiting GitLab partners and driving completion of their GitLab sales and technical training
  - generating in-market customer awareness and passing qualified leads
- Augment GitLab sales capacity and coverage. Distributor sales teams:
  - work with partners and GitLab sales teams to aid in co-selling
  - are often in-market and speak local languages
- Offload transaction administration from GitLab sales, freeing time for more valuable selling activities
  - Distributor e-Marketplaces allow GitLab orders to be placed by customers and partners that are delivered in minutes, with zero touch by GitLab teams
  - Provide a single point of contact that is an expert in the GitLab Quote to Cash process, driving efficiencies throughout the sales cycle
  - Enable GitLab to scale our operations to allow for increased transaction volume without significant headcount additions (e.g., Deal Desk, Order Management, Billing)
- Credit management
  - Reduce credit management cost and risk for GitLab
  - Offer an array of financing options including the ability for our partners/customers to transact in local currency, which reduces their risk
- Extend GitLab technical services, training capacity, and coverage, both pre and post-sale

#### Distributor Requirements and Coverage by Geo and Market

**For Commercial Markets:**

- Open Partners located in regions/countries with active Authorized GitLab Distributors must purchase GitLab via those distributors
- Select Partners may choose to transact directly with GitLab (excluding certain regions) or via the region's authorized distributor(s)
- In NORTH AMERICA, Partners transact with [Climb Solutions](https://www.climbcs.com/) via `sales@climbcs.com` and `sales@climbcs.ca` in the US and Canada, respectively
- In EMEA: Partners transact with [Amazic](https://distribution.amazic.com/) via `gitlab@amazic.com`

- In APAC (several countries):  Partners transact with [Tech Data/TD Synnex](https://www.techdata.com/apac/en/partner-with-us/become-a-partner.html) via `GitLab.APJ@techdata.com`
  - In India: Partners may also choose to transact with Redington via `gitlab@redington.co.in`
  - In Japan: Partners may choose to transact with either [Networld](https://www.networld.co.jp/product/gitlab/) via `gitlab-info@networld.co.jp` or [SB C&S](https://cas.softbank.jp/) via `SBCASGRP-DevOps+gitlabdisti@g.softbank.co.jp`
  - In Thailand: Partners may also choose to transact with [Get On Technology](https://www.got.co.th/contact) via `gitlab@got.co.th`

GitLab sellers can also refer to the [partner billing section](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#how-to-find-partner-billing-records-in-sfdc-and-use-for-quoting) of this handbook for a link to our distributor billing records and guidance on how these records are used in the quoting process.

**For US PubSec:**

- Partners transact with Carahsoft via `gitlab@carahsoft.com`

#### Rules of Engagement for Distributor Quotes and Orders

Distributors work directly with GitLab Sellers on the quoting and ordering process. GitLab Sellers can leverage the [partner quoting resources](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-quoting-overview-and-resources), [distributor contact information](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#distributor-requirements-and-coverage-by-geo-and-market), and [GitLab Sales FAQ - Selling with Partners](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/sales-faq/) to aid in the quote and order process.

If a reseller requests a quote directly from a distributor via the aliases above, any non-PubSec distributors may contact `partnersupport@gitlab.com` to request an official quote. Partner Support will forward the request to the GitLab Sales Rep that owns the customer account/opportunity for Sales to work the opportunity with the distributor, including creating and providing the quote.

If a GitLab Sales Rep is working directly with a reseller and needs to quote that reseller via a distributor (e.g., they are an Open partner), Sales can leverage the resources linked in this section above to create the quote and send to distribution.

**Important to note for GitLab Sellers:**

- Our pricing on a two-tier distribution deal is between GitLab and Distributor only. We should **never** include the reseller or customer when sending a distribution quote or discussing distributor pricing.
- Distributors have their own pricelist and are equipped to self-quote and order new business or other order types from it without receiving an official GitLab quote, as long as pricing is at standard programmatic discounts. There may be times, especially in multiple bid scenarios, where you may not be aware of the partner(s) bidding on an opportunity until we receive a PO.

#### Distributor e-Marketplaces

GitLab is activating Distributor e-Marketplaces for customers to transact via GitLab authorized resellers. There are specific requirements for partners prior to activating their e-Marketplace capability, including:

- Partner is an authorized GitLab Open or Select partner in good standing.
- GitLab e-Marketplace page that includes an overview of the partner's technical expertise and/or services offerings.
- GitLab review of the draft page, and GitLab's written (email) approval provided to the Distributor.

GitLab reserves the right to pause or deactivate a partner's e-Marketplace offering if issues arise.
For more information about Distributor e-Marketplaces, partners should [contact their distributor](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#transacting-through-distribution), or their GitLab Channel Manager.

### Partner Sales FAQ

Partners and GitLab Sellers frequently ask questions on how to collaborate with one another throughout the GitLab sales process. Refer to the following resources which document these FAQs and answers from both a Partner and GitLab Seller perspective:

- [Partner FAQ - Selling with GitLab](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/partner-faq/)
- [GitLab Sales FAQ - Selling with Partners](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/sales-faq/)

## SFDC Field Definitions

### Section I: Partner Sourced Deal Registration

- **DR - Partner**: The reseller partner that 'submitted' the Partner Sourced Deal Registration that the GitLab Sales Team subsequently 'approved' in the system
- **DR - Partner Deal Type**:
  - _MSP_: The partner purchases _and owns_ the license on behalf of the customer
  - _Resale_: The partner is actually transacting the deal on their paper
  - _Referral_: The partner is bringing us the lead/opportunity but will either transact directly with GitLab or through another partner
- **DR - Status**: Dictates whether the Partner Sourced Deal Registration is Pending, Approved or Denied
- **DR - Distributor**: The GitLab-authorized distributor from which the DR - Partner is buying, when applicable

    ![PSDR](/images/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/image-9.png)

### Section II: Primary Quote Partner Data*

- **Resale Partner**: The resale partner on the primary quote; the transacting partner
- **Distributor**: The GitLab-authorized distributor that transacts according to the primary quote
- **Resale Partner Track**: Value will be Select, Open, or Technology, and is determined based on `Resale Partner`
***Stamped from primary quote when approved. Fields are locked.**

    ![Primary_Quote](/images/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/image-10.png)

### Section III: Partner Contribution Data

- **Referral**: A link to the Labra/AWS registration record
- **ESM/Cloud ESM Notes**: ESMs and Cloud ESMs enter partner opportuity notes and next steps here
- **Alliance Partner Opp ID**: ESMs and Cloud ESMs enter the cloud partner (AWS or GCP) co-sell registration ID here

- **Hyperscaler Engaged**: ESMs and Cloud ESMs can select the cloud partner (AWS or GCP) engaged on early stage marketplace deals

    ![Partner_Contribution](/images/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/image-11.png)

### Services Resale

- Partners can earn a program discount for reselling GitLab Professional Services

### Incumbency Renewals

- Incumbent partners qualify for program renewal discounts. The partners that transact the most recent sale are considered the incumbent.
- A different partner can earn an incumbency discount only through formal written communications from the customer. This can be provided via email from an authorized representative from the customer.
- To earn partner discounts, partners will be required to meet compliance requirements (i.e. in good credit standing, have provided quarterly updates on the customer, review within 30 days of renewal, etc).
- GitLab Sales must work with incumbent channel partners on renewals unless the customer documents in writing that they no longer want to work with the partner.  GitLab cannot offer a direct renewal quote if there is an incumbent partner.

### Tender Offers (Multiple Bids)

- Tender offers are ones where the customers are requesting multiple bids for a project.
- Since all partners would be engaged in the sales process and would be creating a bid, all partners qualify for the Partner Co-Sell discount. However, if a partner was early in with the customer (pre-tender) and sourced the deal, then they could receive the higher discount with an approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration. If the partner earning the Partner Sourced discount is not awarded the deal, they would not receive additional referral compensation. Any partner offering their own services would qualify for Service Attach incentives in addition to any sales discounts for which they would qualify. The exception to the above would be for:
  - US PubSec business: In the event there is an approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration on a tender offer, the rest of the partners bidding would receive MSRP (List Price).
  - Renewals: Incumbent resellers get last year's discount, all other resellers get MSRP (List Price) for flat renewals. Renewal add-ons for all resellers can receive program discounts based on Deal Registration Status.

### Program Compliance

- For partners to transact according to program discounts, they must agree to the GitLab Partner Agreement.
- To earn partner discounts, partners are required to be program compliant.
- Non-contracted partners may transact on a one-off basis, only with explicit approval of regional channel directors, the director of channel programs, or the vice president of channels.

## Unauthorized Partners

- An authorized partner is a partner that has signed a contract to transact with GitLab. In SFDC, the "Partner Status" will say "Authorized," there will be a date in the "Signed Contract Date" field, and _either_ the "Click-Through Agreement" box will be checked, or a manual contract will be listed in the Google docs or Contract section of the account record.
- A key goal of the GitLab Channel Program is the success of our authorized partners, which means whenever possible, we should work deals with them. We are developing our channel to provide coverage across geos, customer segments and vertical markets. However, there are some situations where customer requires a deal be transacted by a partner that is not willing to join the GitLab Partner Program. Only in those situations should we transact with an unauthorized partner, and only with the explicit approval of the programs team.
- Unauthorized partners have not signed a GitLab Partner Agreement.
- If an unauthorized partner would like to transact GitLab products or services, please have them visit the [Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/) to sign up. Someone who has authority to accept the Agreement is required.
- Unauthorized partners cannot transact GitLab products and/or services, unless rare but explicit approval is granted by the programs team. Please reach out to the #partner-programs-ops Slack channel.

### Legal Requests for Partner Contracts

The process to request the [legal team's involvement in partner contracts](/handbook/legal/customer-negotiations/#to-request-a-legal-review-for-a-channel-partner-contract) can be found on the legal team's handbook page. Please note that the process for getting partner contracts signed is different from the [process for any other legal request](/handbook/legal/customer-negotiations/#how-to-reach-legal).

## Partner Reporting and Tagging

![Partner Reporting and Tagging](/images/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/image-5.png)

### Definitions

1. **Deal Path**: How the deal is transacted. Values can be Partner, Direct, Web Direct. _Note, Partner includes Referral and Influence opportunities_
1. **Partner Sourced Deal Reg**: Partner submits a Registration for their sourced opportunity via the Partner Portal. For the purposes of this matrix the assumption is the Deal Reg is approved. If the deal is not Partner Sourced then Deal Reg does not apply
1. **DR - Deal Type**: The type of Partner Sourced Deal Registration submitted by the Partner. Options include Resale, Referral, and MSP. _Note, this field will be blank if there is no Partner Source Deal Registration_
1. **Initial Source**: SFDC Lead value that is populated based on lead source. Defaults to PQL (Partner Qualified Lead) when a Partner submits a Partner Sourced Deal Reg and an Opportunity does not already exist in the system
1. **Sales Qualified Sourced (SQS)**: Who converts/creates the Opportunity in SFDC. Can only be 1 value
1. **Order Type**: Customer order designation in SFDC. New First Order or Growth

### Use Cases

- **Numbers 1 & 2**
  - Two potential paths:
    - Partner submits Partner Sourced Deal Reg and no Opportunity exists in the system. Initial source is PQL and SQS defaults to Partner Generated
    - AE or SDR creates an opportunity prior to a valid Partner Sourced Deal Reg being submitted and approved. Opportunity will automatically update SQS to Partner Generated when a Deal Registration is linked and approved
  - Number 1 is transacted via the partner that sourced the opportunity, while Number 2 is a sourced referral that was transacted directly with the customer
  - This applies to both New and Growth orders

- **Number 3**
  - Partner submits an order for a deal where we did not have an opportunity in the system did not submit a Partner Sourced Deal Reg

- **Number 4**
  - Deal is transacting thru the partner but was sourced by either a GitLab AE or SDR

### Default Logic

1. If `Partner Sourced Deal Reg = True` and no opportunity exists, then `Initial Source = PQL` and `SQS = Partner Generated`
2. If `Partner Sourced Deal Reg` is linked to an existing opportunity and approved, then `SQS = Partner Generated`
3. If `Initial Source = PQL` then `SQS = Partner Generated`

### SFDC Opportunity Source Field Values for Channel

- **Initial Source** - _Partner Qualified Lead (PQL)_: Partner created and/or qualified the Lead whether they sourced it themselves or GitLab provided the inquiry to them to work.
- **Sales Qualified Source**: - _Partner Generated_:
  - Partner has converted the Lead/PQL to a qualified opportunity, or has created a brand new opportunity without a prior lead being in the system. SQS defaults to Partner when `Initial Source = PQL`
  - Partner submits Partner Sourced Deal Reg which (i) creates a new opportunity or (ii) is attached to an existing opportunity and approved by GitLab

## Managing Partner Opportunities

[Partner Co-Sell (Resale)](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-co-sell) | Partner Sourced Deal Registration: [Resale](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-resale-opportunities) | [MSP](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-msp-opportunities) | [Referral](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-referral-opportunities)

In order to transact with GitLab, a partner must both be authorized by GitLab, and have completed at least one sales training.

### Partner Co-Sell

All Channel deals are considered Partner Co-Sell opportunities unless there is an approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration or the Opportunities Sales Qualified Source = Partner Generated. These opportunities are not sourced solely by a partner, but highlight the relationship between GitLab and partners in the selling process. Partner Co-Sell deals do not require the partner to submit a deal registration, and should be processed according to standard Partner Co-Sell discounts as identified in the [GitLab Partner Program](/handbook/resellers/).

### US Public Sector Preferred Partner Co-Sell Request Process

The Partner Sourced Deal Registration process is the same for commercial and US Pubsec business. The instructions below apply _only_ to US Public Sector CoSell opportunities.

1. Each public sector partner is provided a link to a Google form by either the SAE, ISR, or Channel Manager. This form must be completed in order for a partner to receive Preferred Partner Co-Sell discounts.
2. When a partner becomes aware of an opportunity, they must fill in the Google form, which will timestamp all of the relevant data to a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cd5xEDdfiiyMW81oykv6Gq58nG1kn3Sxz9h7adY1o8U/edit?usp=sharing).
3. Part of filling out the Google form requires the partner to input the name and email of the SAE with whom they've discussed this. When that email address is inputted into the form and the form is submitted, that SAE will receive notification of a Pubsec Co-Sell opportunity.
4. The SAE will then approve or deny the submission based on Handbook guidelines.
   - The business reason for accepting a preferred partner submission must be noted on the Google form.
   - The SAE's approval or denial will be time stamped in the Google sheet.
5. Once a partner is approved and selected, the 18-digit opportunity ID will be shared with them.
6. If a partner was previously approved but is now being removed, that SAE can selected the "Removed" option and enter the partner's email address to notify them

All submissions will be recorded and tracked for audit purposes. The chosen preferred partner should match the Resale Partner on the quote with the Partner Co-Sell discount.

Any other partner receiving a quote for the same opportunity will be provided MSRP.

Further enablement for GitLab Team Members is available. For further information, contact the #partner-programs-ops slack channel.

### Guidelines for approving US Public Sector Co-Sell Partner Submissions

The following are explicit guidelines for approved US Public Sector Partners to receive preferred pricing on GitLab-sourced opportunities.

Partner Requirements:

- Must be an approved US Public Sector Partner, [authorized to transact with GitLab](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#standard-channel-practices)
- The partner must have completed one meeting with the SAE for the opportunity
   -This meeting must have included a conversation about alignment of how we can work together to land with vision and expand with purpose
- The partner must have filled out the Public Sector Co-Sell form and include the 18-digit Opportunity ID provided by the SAE

### Partner Sourced Deal Registration

The Partner Sourced Deal Registration program rewards partners for bringing net-new business to GitLab. There are three types of Partner Sourced Deal Registrations within the GitLab Partner Program:

1. Registration of partner sourced Resale opportunities
2. Registration of partner sourced MSP opportunities (partner purchases and holds title to licenses to deliver a managed service to their end customer)
3. Registration of partner sourced Referral opportunities (partner does not transact the business they bring to GitLab)

Refer to the following sections for step-by-step instructions on how to process each registration type: [Resale](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-resale-opportunities), [MSP](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-msp-opportunities), and [Referral](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-referral-opportunities).

GitLab's Ecosystem Sales Managers, Sales Reps, and Area Sales Managers collaborate to review and action Partner Sourced Deal Registration submissions. Refer to the [Partner Sourced Deal Registration: How it Works](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-how-it-works) section for details on the review and approval process.

**The SLA for GitLab to communicate with partners on a Partner Sourced Deal Registration is two business days. There must be contact with the registering partner within two business days, whether it be initial outreach to discuss the registration, a request for more information, approval, or rejection.**

There can only be one Partner Sourced Deal Registration approved for an opportunity, _as only one partner can source a deal_. As a reminder, Partner Sourced Deal Registrations are opportunity-based and partners cannot register an account.

### Partner Sourced Deal Registration: How it Works

The Partner Portal is hosted by Impartner and has SSO enabled with Vartopia, the partner-facing Deal Registration system.

**Partner**

The partner submits a Partner Sourced Deal Registration and then the following occurs:

1. An email is sent to the partner acknowledging that the deal registration has been successfully created and submitted. The registration is also viewable in the deal registration section of the partner's portal account.
2. The system creates a Registration record on the Registration object in SFDC that includes all the details of the registration.
3. The system notifies the Ecosystem Operations team to review the registration.

**Ecosystem Operations**

The Ecosystem Operations team reviews the registration after it is submitted by the partner (`DR-Status` = "Submitted"). If there is:

- _an existing customer account in SFDC_, they will link the account and contact to the registration, assign the appropriate Ecosystem Sales Manager, then submit the registration for Ecosystem Sales Manager approval.
- _no existing customer account in SFDC_, they will create the account, link the account and contact to the registration, then hold for SFDC to assign the account territory and owner in an overnight update. Ecosystem Operations will assign the appropriate Ecosystem Sales Manager to the registration after customer account assignments are completed by system, then submit the registration for Ecosystem Sales Manager approval.

The Ecosystem Sales Manager on the registration is automatically assigned as the `Account Owner` of the Partner Account in SFDC. Ecosystem Operations will reassign the registration to the correct Ecosystem Sales Manager as part of their review in cases where adjustment is required to align the appropriate Ecosystem Sales Manager based on customer account territory or ownership. The Ecosystem Operations team has a 2 hour SLA to action registrations within their working hours, Monday through Friday.

**GitLab Ecosystem Sales Manager**

The Ecosystem Sales Manager receives an email notification to review the Partner Sourced Deal Registration once the Ecosystem Operations Team has actioned the registration and submitted it for approval (`DR-Status` = "Pending Sales Review"). Ecosystem Sales Managers can also view registrations in their list view within the SFDC Registration tab. The Ecosystem Sales Manager is responsible for reviewing the registration and communicating with the applicable GitLab Sales Rep and ASM during this process. The Ecosystem Sales Manager must either approve, reject, or return the registration for additional information after completing their review. If they approve, it will automatically be sent to the appropriate ASM for final review.

**GitLab Area Sales Manager (ASM)**

The GitLab ASM for the opportunity is responsible for final review of any Partner Sourced Deal Registration approved by a Ecosystem Sales Manager, and must either approve, reject, or return the registration for additional information. The ASM receives an email notification to review the registration only if/when the Ecosystem Sales Manager approves (`DR-Status` = "Pending ASM Review"). ASMs can also view registrations in their list view within the SFDC Registration tab.

****Alliance and GSI Partners**

Alliance marketplace and OEM partners, and GSI partners do source opportunities for GitLab; however, they do not submit their own Partner Sourced Deal Registrations for these opportunities. The Registration process for these partners is instead initiated by the GitLab Ecosystem Sales Manager on behalf of the partner.

The steps below outline how a Partner Sourced Deal Registration is submitted on behalf of an alliance or GSI partner to initiate the Deal Registration process:

1. The GitLab Ecosystem Sales Manager opens the [Alliance and GSI Partner Sourced Deal Registration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16wTiDbwBoomUmnu2y4OmAAdC4VpvMIUGL1k4vdSrl2Y/edit?usp=sharing) document and follows the instructions to submit a Registration via the google form.
1. Ecosystem Operations team uses the data provided in the google form to submit a formal Partner Sourced Deal Registration via Vartopia on behalf of the partner.
1. The standard Partner Sourced Deal Registration process is then followed beginning with the "Partner" paragraph at the top of this handbook section.

_Note, Partner Sourced Deal Registration incentives do not apply to alliance partners, as our alliance partner agreements supersede these programmatic incentives._

### Partner Sourced Deal Registration: Rules of Engagement

- **Partner Sourced Discount**
  - To receive a quote with a Partner Sourced discount, the partner must submit a Partner Sourced Deal Registration for the opportunity which must be approved by GitLab.
  - Only one partner can earn a Partner Sourced discount per opportunity. Partners will generally receive the Co-Sell discount rate if they do not have an approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration.
- **Approval Criteria**
  - Partner Sourced Deal Registration approval is based on who sourced that particular opportunity. If the partner brought us the deal, then the registration should be approved. For clarity, it is not about first touch with the customer, but the actual creation/conversion of an opportunity.
  - The GitLab Ecosystem Sales Manager should communicate and align with the GitLab Sales Rep and ASM prior to approving or rejecting the Deal Registration.
  - The GitLab ASM should communicate and align with the GitLab Ecosystem Sales Manager and Sales Rep prior to approving or rejecting the Deal Registration.
- **GitLab SLAs**
  - The SLA for GitLab to communicate with partners on a Partner Sourced Deal Registration is two business days. There must be contact with the registering partner within two business days, whether it be initial outreach to discuss the registration, a request for more information, approval, or rejection.
  - The GitLab ASM has one business day to either approve or reject the Registration, which begins when the Registration hits their queue for approval. The ASM _must_ communicate with the GitLab Ecosystem Sales Manager if their approval is anticipated to push beyond the one business day SLA.
- _Identify and Notify Backup Approvers_

  - GitLab Ecosystem Sales Managers and ASMs should _always_ identify a backup approver prior to being out of office. This ensures approval requests can be actioned in your absence, and is crucial to meeting our SLAs (see **GitLab SLAs** above).
  - Ecosystem Sales Managers

    - Communicate that you will be out of office to your backup approver. The backup approver should monitor the `Pending Deal Reg's by PM` component of their [Partner Forecast Dashboard](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-forecast-salesforce-dashboards) to identify and action Deal Registrations in Pending Sales Review for the Ecosystem Sales Manager they are covering.
    - If you find an ASM is out of office while communicating with the Sales Rep and ASM during your approval process (see **Approval Criteria** above), align with their backup approver. If you approve the Deal Registration, chatter the backup approver to request their final approval on the record, as aligned to your discussion.

  - ASMs - Communicate that you will be out of office to your backup approver. Ecosystem Sales Managers will raise Deal Registrations for their review in your absence. Ensure your backup approver is prepared to action these requests while you are out.

- **Standard Term and Extension**
  - Approved deal registrations have a standard 90-day expiration from the date of original approval.
  - Deal Registration extensions beyond the initial 90-day approval are at the sole discretion of GitLab. To grant a standard 30-day extension, GitLab Partner and/or Field Sales can click the `Extend DR 30 Days` button on the Registration. For non-standard extensions beyond 30 days, please chatter `@Partner Operations` on the registration record and provide the new date that the registration should expire.
- **GitLab and Partner Collaboration in the Sales Process**
  - _Resale and MSP opportunities_ - GitLab collaborates with the partner holding the approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration and is available to support the partner throughout the entire sales process.
  - _Referral opportunities_ - The partner refers GitLab to the appropriate customer contact(s) which results in a qualified opportunity for GitLab. GitLab generally then leads the sales process to completion.
- **Closed Lost Registered Opportunity**
  - The GitLab Sales Rep will generally notify the partner by phone or email that the opportunity is not moving forward and then update the SFDC opportunity to Closed Lost.
  - The Deal Registration will update to Closed Lost in the system and the partner will receive a notification.

### Partner Sourced Deal Registration: System Status and Information

- Deal Registration details will never override any information that the sales team forecasts on the Opportunity.
- The Deal Registration ID (`DR - Deal ID`) can be used to track all Deal Registrations in the system.
- Deal Registrations are individual Registration records under the Registration object in SFDC. Deal Registrations are not Lead records on the Lead object.

### Partner Sourced Deal Registration: Resale Opportunities

Partner Sourced Deal Registrations for resale opportunities reward partners for bringing net-new business to GitLab. An approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration generally provides the partner a deeper discount than the Co-Sell rate, as outlined in the [GitLab Partner Program](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/#definitions-and-qualifications).

Follow the steps below to process a Partner Sourced Deal Registration for a resale opportunity:

#### Ecosystem Sales Manager for first review and action

1. Ecosystem Operations Team:

   - has first action to review and update the registration when `DR-Status` = `Submitted`. **Important to note**, the registration is _not ready_ for Ecosystem Sales Manager review while in `DR-Status` = `Submitted`.
   - will update `DR-Status` to `Pending Sales Review` once their work is complete and the registration is ready for Ecosystem Sales Manager review (refer to [How it Works](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-how-it-works) for details). `DR-Status` being updated to `Pending Sales Review` sends a notification to the Ecosystem Sales Manager to review and action the registration.

1. Click the link in either your email or [Deal Registration View](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/a9W?fcf=00B4M000004toX7) to open the registration record in Salesforce.
1. Confirm the `Deal Registration Type` is "Resale" and that the partner provided sufficient detail to proceed with the registration. If registration details are:
   - _accurate and complete_, proceed to the next step.
   - _inaccurate and/or incomplete_, return the registration to request more information from the partner. Select "Returned" in the `PM Approval Status` field, add your information request for the partner in the `PM Comments` field, then click the `Save` button to complete the return process.
    ![16-Returned_Reg](/images/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/16-Returned_Reg.png)
1. Discuss the opportunity with the GitLab Sales Rep and ASM and decide to either approve or reject the registration.
1. Click `Link/Create Opportunity`.
    ![14-Link_Create_Opp_Button](/images/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/14-Link_Create_Opp_Button.png)
1. On the "Link/Create Opportunity" page, search for the opportunity in the provided list and/or perform a "Global Search."
   - **If the opportunity already exists** and you plan to:
     - _**Approve**_ the registration, click `Link & Make Primary` next to the opportunity name. You will then be brought back to the deal registration record.
     - _**Reject**_ the registration, click `Link` next to the opportunity name. You will then be brought back to the deal registration record.
   - **If there is no matching opportunity**, click `Create New`, then choose "Standard" as the Opportunity Record Type. Click "Save" on the opportunity and you will be brought back to the "Link/Create Opportunity" page. Click `Link & Make Primary` and you will be brought back to the deal registration record.
    ![15-Link_Create_Opp_Screen](/images/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/15-Link_Create_Opp_Screen.png)

   ![19-Change_Opp_Owner_Button](/images/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/19-Change_Opp_Owner_Button.png)

#### Area Sales Manager (ASM) for final review and action (if approved by Ecosystem Sales Manager)

1. You will receive an approval request email when a registration has entered your queue for review and approval. Click the link in your email or [Deal Registration View](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/a9W?fcf=00B8X00000AmOeS) to open the registration record in SFDC.
2. Confirm alignment with the Ecosystem Sales Manager and GitLab Sales Rep prior to providing final approval or rejection on the registration.
3. Click `Approve/Deny/Return Registration`.
    ![18_1-Approve_Reject_Return_Button](/images/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/18_1-Approve_Reject_Return_Button.png)

    ![18_2-ASM_Approval](/images/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/18_2-ASM_Approval.png)

_The deal registration form is not a quoting tool and will not have all the information needed to create a quote. The GitLab Sales Rep must connect with the partner to request any necessary information prior to creating a quote._

### Partner Sourced Deal Registration: MSP Opportunities

Partner Sourced Deal Registrations for MSP opportunities reward partners for managing products and services for their end customers. An approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration generally provides the partner a deeper discount than the Co-Sell rate, as outlined in the [GitLab Partner Program](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/#definitions-and-qualifications).

A Managed Service Provider (MSP) purchases licenses on behalf of an end user. The MSP will be the owner and manager of the licenses but their customer, the end user, is the one using the licenses. This creates specific needs in GitLab Salesforce opportunities to ensure proper reporting and compensation. _Please note that the steps for an MSP opportunity differ from the steps for a resale opportunity_.

Follow the steps below to process a Partner Sourced Deal Registration for an MSP opportunity:

#### Ecosystem Sales Manager for first review and action

1. Ecosystem Operations Team:

   - has first action to review and update the registration when `DR-Status` = `Submitted`. **Important to note**, the registration is _not ready_ for Ecosystem Sales Manager review while in `DR-Status` = `Submitted`.

_The deal registration form is not a quoting tool and will not have all the information needed to create a quote. The GitLab Sales Rep must connect with the partner to request any necessary information prior to creating a quote._

### Partner Sourced Deal Registration: Referral Opportunities

Partner Sourced Deal Registrations for referral opportunities reward partners for bringing net-new business to GitLab, even if that partner does not transact the deal. An approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration for a referral opportunity provides the partner a **back-end rebate** upon GitLab successfully closing the deal as won (processed quarterly), as outlined in the [GitLab Partner Program](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/#definitions-and-qualifications).

### Service Attached Registration

GitLab incentivizes Select partners and Designated Professional Services Partners (PSP) that sell their own professional services into a customer environment. The partner must submit service opportunities via a Service Attached Registration on the [Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/English). Service Attached qualifications do not require license purchases through a services partner. Customers can obtain licenses directly from GitLab, through a services partner, or from other partners. 

Refer to the [program guidelines](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/#how-service-attached-registrations-work) for Service Attached Registration approval requirements. Select partners and PSPs with approved Service Attached Registrations qualify for quarterly back-end rebates. GitLab sellers qualify for partners services compensation upon approval of Service Attached Registration from a Designated Professional Services Partner (PSP). Refer to the [GitLab Sales Commissions Internal Handbook](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-commission/) for further details.

Review the steps below to understand how a Service Attached Registration for an applicable GitLab software opportunity is processed.

#### Ecosystem Operations for First Review and Action

Ecosystem Operations has first action to review and update the registration when `DR-Status` = `Submitted`:

1. Link the Customer account
2. Link the associated software opportunity
3. Verify that the linked opportunity has no _approved_ Service Attached Registration, as additional registrations will be denied
4. Set `DR - Status` and `Service Attach Status` to `Pending`
5. Add Registration Name (REGxxxxx) to `Service Attach Registration` on the liked opportunity
6. Add `Service Attach Partner` to the linked opportunity

#### Partner Submits Executed Statement of Work

Email your valid Statement of Work and Deal ID to partnersupport@gitlab.com. The Statement of Work (SOW) must meet [GitLab Partner Program requirements](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/#how-service-attached-registrations-work).

#### Ecosystem Operations for Second Review and Final Action

1. Ecosystem Operations reviews the partner SOW and moves the registration to one of the following statuses:

    - **`Pending`**: Additional information or documentation is needed. Ecosystem Operations will leave the registration in `Pending` status and work with the partner to obtain required documentation.
    - **`Pending Opportunity Closure`**: The partner's SOW (i) has been submitted and (ii) meets [program requirements](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/#how-service-attached-registrations-work), but the related software opportunity is not yet closed-won
    - **`Approved`**: (i) The SOW has been submitted and approved, (ii) the opportunity has been closed-won, and (iii) all other [program requirements](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/#how-service-attached-registrations-work) have been met
    - **`Accepted`**: Qualifies for PSP, but not for rebate. Paid service engagement with a SOW signed and submitted within 12 months of registration submission and closed-won Net ARR opportunity.
    - **`Unqualified`**: The registration and/or SOW do not qualify for Service Attached program as defined by the [GitLab Partner Program](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/#how-service-attached-registrations-work) 
    - **`Closed`**: If the opportunity has moved to Closed-Lost or if the partner or ESM communicates the partner did not win the services business

2. Ecosystem Operations adds the `Service Attach Approval Date` when the registration is moved to `Approved`. `Service Reg Approval Date` will be set when both requirements below are fulfilled:
    - Receipt of valid executed SOW
    - Opportunity Closed Won status
    - All other [program requirements](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/#how-service-attached-registrations-work) are met

### Additional Information

- `PSP Engaged` on the software opportunity will automatically check when the linked `Service Attach Partner` is a Designated Professional Services Partner (PSP)
- `Partner Services Amount` is calculated as `Net ARR` multipled by an attach rate as defined in the [Sales Commissions Internal Handbook](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/sales-commission/)
- Partner Service Attached incentives are outlined in the [GitLab Channel Partner Program Discounts and Incentive Guide](https://gitlab.highspot.com/items/626018776705c7e7d2df0bce?lfrm=rhp.0)
- Rebates and referral fees may require CRO approval
- Discounts are off list price. If GitLab is deeply discounting a large ARR customer engagement, the partner can reasonably expect to share in that with a discount reduction. The Partner, GitLab Sales, Ecosystem Sales Manager must agree on the negotiated discount amount

### Partner Rebate Exception Review Process

While rebates are generally intended for Partner Sourced business only, there may be corner cases where GitLab wants to provide the partner a rebate for Sourced-like activities that resulted in a different outcome. The following `Partner Rebate Exception Review Process` can be used to requset a rebate exception.

1. The Ecosystem Programs teams and GTM FP&A will collect Partner rebate exception requests up until the 15th of the last month of the quarter
2. Around the 15th of the last month of the quarter, GTM FP&A, Ecosystem Programs, Ecosystem Operations, Ecosystem Strategy, and Ecosystem Sales Leadership will meet to review each case. Possible outcomes include:
   - Rejecting the rebate request
   - Approving the request, funded by Global Ecosystem budget
   - Approving the request, funded by the involved account team’s budget
3. Results will be shared with you and your leaders after review and will be documented via Chatter. If the request is approved, rebates will be paid out within 45 days of the new quarter.

## Partner Influence

Partners can influence GitLab opportunities without transacting the deal. The Partner Team (ESM, Cloud ESM, or SA) can submit an internal Partner Influence record to track their partner's influence activities.

Partner influence activities include customer executive engagement and advocacy and/or working side by side with GitLab on the customer pursuit in the following ways:

- Intro to customer decision maker/C-Suite
- Host/participate in Exec briefing, advocating for GitLab
- Trusted exec or technical advisor proactively advocating for GitLab
- Intro and/or position GitLab as part of a better together software sale
- Deliver presentation, demo, POC, or RFP response
- Deliver customer strategy that recommends GitLab
- Advise GitLab acct. Team on customer strategy/use case/pain points

Follow the steps below to track a partner's influence on an opportunity:

1. From the Related List Quick Links at the top of the opportunity page, hover your cursor over Influence Partners and select `New Influence Partner`
    ![Alt text](/images/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/image.png)
1. Add a partner to the `Influence Partner` field using the lookup button
1. Select the applicable `Influence Type`:

    ![Alt text](/images/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/image-1.png)
1. Attach any supporting documentation that highlights the partner's influence on the opportunity via `Google Docs, Notes, & Attachments` section.

## Channel Approvals

Channel Approvers for opportunities are based on the Opportunity Owner's User Region. Whenever an approver changes, an [issue must be opened with Sales Systems](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/systems/-/issues/new?issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=) to replace the old approver with the new. Current channel approvers can be seen in our [channel approver matrix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-CH-uH_zr0qaVaV1QbmVZ1rF669DsaUeq9w-q1QiKPE/edit#heading=h.jxrpmpixprez).

If an approver will not be able to approve opportunities due to PTO or some other reason, they must [assign a delegate](/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#reassign-quote-approvals) in SFDC to approve opportunities on their behalf.

## Letters of Authorization

When a partner needs a Letter of Authorization ("LOA"), they must log into the partner portal and request one from the "Letter of Authorization" button along the top of the page. If a partner does not log in to the portal, they will not be able to access this request. This helps ensure that only authorized partners can access the link and request a LOA.

The partner will be prompted to input basic company information that will auto-fill the LOA. Upon submission, the LOA will automatically be sent to the Ecosystem Operations team for review and confirmation that the entity requesting the LOA is a valid and authorized partner. Once appproved by Ecosystem Operations, the LOA will automatically be sent to the legal team who will approve and initial the LOA before sending it to GitLab's PAO for signature. Once signed, the LOA will be sent directly to the partner via email. The letter is good for one calendar year from the date on the letter.

## Program and Incentive Definitions

- The GitLab Ecosystem Program provides partners with set discounts based on their program status and whether or not there is an active deal registration.
- At least one partner employee must complete the GitLab Foundations for Partners training for the partner to qualify for deal registration and program discounts.
- GitLab employees can access the [partner discount guidance here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qiT_2EsnL20c4w0hyZ_CGaJQIzj8CSCsHERoR80cwws/edit?usp=sharing)
- Partners can find the discount table in the Asset Library on the [GitLab Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/).

### Opportunity Tagging for Marketplace Deals

_**Use Case 1: Partner Co-Sell (Marketplace transaction with no source credit)**_

If a deal is being transacted through **GCP Marketplace** or **AWS Marketplace**, then the following fields need to be filled out on the opportunity:

- **Resale Partner** = [GCP](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001nJhks)_or [AWS](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001ldTdt)_
*_Be sure to use the correct SFDC account. Click on the link to confirm the GCP and/or AWS account.)_

_**Use Case 2: Partner Sourced Deal Registration (No Marketplace transaction)**_

If GCP or AWS brought us a lead/referred GitLab a deal, but will not be transacting on Marketplace, then the following fields should be filled out on the opportunity:

- **DR - Partner** should be filled out using [GCP](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001nJhks) or [AWS](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001ldTdt) account
- **DR - Partner Deal Type** = Referral

_**Use Case 3: Partner Sourced Deal Registration (Marketplace transaction)**_
If GCP or AWS brought us a lead/referred GitLab a deal, and will be transacting on Marketplace, then the following fields should be filled out on the opportunity:

- **DR - Partner** should be filled out using [GCP](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001nJhks) or [AWS](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001ldTdt) account
- **DR - Partner Deal Type** = Resale

_**Use Case 4: Partner Influence (No Marketplace transaction and no source credit)**_

If GCP or AWS support a deal and help drive the customer to buy GitLab, but were not the original source of the opportunity nor are they transacting the deal, then the following field should be filled out on the Opportunity:

- **Influence Partner** should be filled out using [GCP](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001nJhks) or [AWS](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001ldTdt) account

### Quote Tagging for Marketplace Deals

- If a deal is being transacted through the **Google Cloud Marketplace**, use the following values in the quote:
  - Invoice Owner = Google Cloud Marketplace
  - Invoice Owner Contact = Cloud Marketplace Payments
    _Note: search "Payments" (with quotation marks) for the correct contact to populate in this field)_
  - Resale Partner = Google Cloud (Partner)
- If a deal is being transacted through the **Amazon Web Services Marketplace**, use the following values in the quote:
  - Invoice Owner = Amazon Web Services, Inc.
  - Invoice Owner Contact = Accounts Payable (AWS)
  - Resale Partner = Amazon Web Services

### Opportunity Tagging for Carahsoft Distributor Seller of Record (DSOR) AWS Marketplace Transactions

Carahsoft's DSOR (Distributor Seller of Record) Program is a partner program designed to provide ISV clients a 2-Tier channel enablement in expanding their business growth through the AWS Marketplace. Under the program, Carahsoft would list GitLab's products on AWS Marketplace and drive the private offer selling motion. Carahsoft develops the selling opportunity and authorizes the Consulting Partner within the AWS Marketplace to release a private offer to the customer.

For deals transacting through the Carahsoft DSOR program, the quote should reflect a normal two-tier channel transaction where the `Distributor` = "Carahsoft Technology Corporation" and `Resale Partner` = the reseller working the opportunity. For more information/instructions on quoting two-tier distribution deals, please refer to [this Deal Desk handbook section](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#distributor-quotes).

To recognize and properly compensate these transactions, please ensure the `CPPO or DSOR Partner` field = "Amazon Web Services" on the opportunity record. Please chatter Chris Novello or Pilar Meija on your DSOR opportunity so they can review the opportunity and update the `CPPO or DSOR Partner` field.
