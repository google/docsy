14.3 The parties acknowledge and agree that, (i) the Software is not designed for the purpose(s) of storing, processing, compiling or transmitting Sensitive Data (as defined herein), and (ii) Customer shall not use the Software, or otherwise provide to GitLab without prior written consent, Sensitive Data under this Agreement. “Sensitive Data” means: (i) special categories of data enumerated in European Union Regulation 2016/679, Article 9(1) or any successor legislation; (ii) patient, medical, or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (as amended and supplemented) (“HIPAA”); (iii) credit, debit, or other payment card data or financial account information, including bank account numbers or other personally identifiable financial information; (iv) social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, or other government identification numbers; (v) other information subject to regulation or protection under specific laws such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act or Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) (or related rules or regulations); or (vi) any data similar to the above protected under foreign or domestic laws.

## APPENDIX 2: Software as a Service (SaaS) Offering

With respect to Customer’s purchase and/or use of the SaaS Software , the following additional terms shall apply.

### AVAILABILITY

Availability to the SaaS Software will be measured, and reported on, by GitLab using instrumentation and observation tools specifically designed to provide a representative measure of service availability. Recent status, references to availability measurement definition, and historical reporting will be available at or linked from the GitLab system status site located at https://status.gitlab.com.

### RESILIENCY

GitLab will architect and maintain an underlying cloud infrastructure with commercially reasonable resiliency for all data, compute, and network services. At a minimum, GitLab will maintain the highest documented level of “GitLab Reference Architecture” as detailed at https://docs.gitlab.com.

### BACKUPS

GitLab will maintain a commercially reasonable system of data backup process and technology to ensure that primary data sources remain recoverable in the event of various system failures.

### MONITORING AND INCIDENT RESPONSE

GitLab will employ a system of instrumentation and observation tools to ensure that system behavior which may limit use of the SaaS Software is detected and announced. GitLab will also employ industry reasonable practices to maintain appropriate engineering personnel availability for the purposes of incident response(s).

### UPDATES AND UPGRADES

GitLab will update the SaaS Software as updates are available and when reasonably practical to implement said updates. Update timing and process will remain at GitLab’s discretion.

### SCHEDULED SYSTEM MAINTENANCE

GitLab will occasionally perform scheduled system maintenance which requires limits to the use of part or all of the SaaS Software features, or significantly reduces features and functions during the scheduled system maintenance period. GitLab will provide ten (10) business days notice for all scheduled system maintenance activities. GitLab will take a proactive approach to minimizing the need for such maintenance and will limit scheduled system maintenance to less than four (4) hours per calendar month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of emergency or urgent issue which may negatively impact GitLab’s customers, GitLab has the right to carry out unscheduled maintenance to remedy such instance(s). For the avoidance of doubt, such unscheduled maintenance shall: (i) be limited to only those issues which may negatively impact customers; and (ii) will be carried out in such a manner to provide for the least amount of disruption to customers.

### SUSPENSION OF SERVICE

GitLab reserves the right to suspend service to the SaaS Software if: (i) Customer fails to comply with the Agreement and this Appendix, (ii) Customer exceeds set application limits, or (iii) requests or usage deemed malicious in nature is identified to be sourced from Customer accounts, personnel, or systems.
