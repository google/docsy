### Shared Risk and Opportunity Register in Compliance with ISO 44001

ISO 44001 requires organizations to manage risks and opportunities collaboratively in partnerships or joint ventures. This register is a key tool for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks, as well as seizing opportunities to ensure the success and sustainability of the collaboration.

The Shared Risk and Opportunity Register ensures that all stakeholders in the collaboration are aware of potential risks and opportunities, their impact on the collaboration, and the mitigation or enhancement strategies in place.

### 1. Register Structure Overview

The Shared Risk and Opportunity Register consists of two primary sections:

- Risk Register: Identifies and assesses potential risks that may affect the collaboration, along with mitigation strategies.

- Opportunity Register: Identifies and assesses potential opportunities that may benefit the collaboration, with strategies for maximising those opportunities.

Each entry includes details like risk/opportunity description, assessment criteria, ownership, and mitigation/enhancement actions.

### 4. Explanation of Key Columns

- Risk/Opportunity ID: Unique identifier for each risk or opportunity for easy tracking.

- Risk/Opportunity Description: A brief description of the identified risk or opportunity.

- Likelihood: A qualitative or quantitative assessment of the likelihood of the risk/opportunity occurring (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

- Impact: An assessment of the potential impact if the risk/opportunity occurs, typically rated as Low, Medium, or High.

- Risk/Opportunity Owner: The person or team responsible for overseeing the management of the risk or opportunity.

- Mitigation Strategy/Action to Maximise Opportunity: A description of the strategy or actions to either reduce the risk or increase the likelihood of realising the opportunity.

- Mitigation Action Owner: The person or team responsible for implementing the mitigation strategy or opportunity enhancement actions.

- Status: The current status of the risk or opportunity (e.g., Active, Pending, Resolved, Closed).

- Date Identified: The date when the risk or opportunity was first identified.

- Next Review Date: The date for the next review of the risk or opportunity to assess progress or changes.

### 5. Steps to Implement the Shared Risk and Opportunity Register

1. Establish Ownership: Assign clear owners to risks and opportunities. These owners should have a clear understanding of their responsibility to monitor, mitigate, or enhance specific risks and opportunities.

1. Regular Monitoring and Updates: Ensure that the register is updated regularly, ideally during scheduled governance meetings, where the status of risks and opportunities can be reviewed and actions updated.

1. Collaboration and Transparency: All stakeholders should have access to the Shared Risk and Opportunity Register to encourage transparency, collaboration, and proactive risk management within the partnership or joint venture.

1. Risk and Opportunity Prioritisation: Based on the impact and likelihood assessments, prioritize risks and opportunities to focus efforts on the most critical issues first.

1. Integration into Governance Model: The register should be an integral part of the regular strategic and operational reviews, ensuring that risks and opportunities are handled in line with the governance and decision-making processes defined by ISO 44001.

### 6. Review and Continuous Improvement

ISO 44001 encourages continuous improvement, so the register should not be a static document. After each review period:

- Assess the effectiveness of the mitigation actions for risks and the maximisation strategies for opportunities.

- Identify new risks and opportunities that may arise in the collaboration.

- Update mitigation strategies and actions to improve risk management and opportunity realisation.

This Shared Risk and Opportunity Register ensures that the collaborative partnership effectively identifies, tracks, and manages risks and opportunities, ultimately contributing to the long-term success of the collaboration while maintaining compliance with ISO 44001.
