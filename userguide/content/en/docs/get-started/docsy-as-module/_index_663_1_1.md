NOTE: The MLOps Incubation Engineering project has become the MLOps team. These pages are left fir historical purposes, but are not actively maintained. Please refer to the [MLOps team page](/handbook/engineering/development/data-science/modelops/mlops) for updated information.

## MLOps Single-Engineer Group

DRI: [@eduardobonet](https://gitlab.com/eduardobonet)

MLOps is a [Single-Engineer Group](/handbook/company/structure/#single-engineer-groups) within our [Incubation Engineering Department](/handbook/engineering/development/incubation/). This group works on early feature exploration and validation related to the [MLOps group](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/modelops/mlops/) within the [ModelOps stage](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/modelops/).

## Vision & Mission

**Mission**: Make GitLab a tool Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers love to use.

**Vision**: Identify opportunities in our portfolio to explore ways where GitLab can provide a better user experience for Data Science and Machine Learning across the entire Machine Learning life cycle (model creation, testing, deployment, monitoring, and iteration).

## Updates

## Current Project

Model Registry & Model Experiments

Mission: Make it dead simple for Data Scientists to manage their model lifecycle within GitLab, from testing different candidates to,
packaging a new model version.

## Usage

## Jobs to Be Done

MLops is a large and young field. We used Jobs to be Done to make it explicit what are the problems users expect MLOps to solve:

## Backlog

We are keeping a backlog for potential exploration areas. Anyone is welcomed to pitch in new ideas using the [Backlog Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mlops/-/epics/8)
