### Introduction

Hello! I’m Nico Sandoval. I’m a Business Systems Analyst with the [Enterprise Applications PMO](//handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/pmo/) team.

### About me

- I currently reside in South Florida but I'am from Cali, Colombia. 
- I’m bilingual, fluent in Spanish and English.
- I love cooking and grilling for family and friends.
- I enjoy swimming and working out.

### My GitLab Story

My GitLab journey began in August 2022, where I found my niche at the intersection of finance and technology. As a System Business Analyst working closely with the Finance team, I serve as a bridge between financial challenges and technical solutions. My role involves deeply understanding financial processes and translating them into technical requirements, enabling us to build more efficient workflows. I also help lead GitLab's Robotic Process Automation (RPA) program, where we've successfully deployed multiple automation projects that have saved countless operational hours. What makes my GitLab experience unique is the opportunity to combine financial acumen with technical problem-solving, helping to streamline and modernize our financial operations. Each day brings new challenges that allow me to leverage GitLab's tools and capabilities to create practical solutions that make a real difference in how our finance team operates.

### My Work Style

My working style centers on collaboration and transparency. I believe the best solutions emerge through open dialogue and exploring multiple perspectives. When faced with a challenge, I prefer to engage in thoughtful discussions with stakeholders, drawing out different viewpoints and potential approaches before settling on a path forward. I find that taking time to connect with colleagues on a personal level builds trust and strengthens our working relationships, which ultimately leads to better outcomes. By fostering an environment of open communication and mutual understanding, I can more effectively bridge the gap between technical solutions and business needs.

### Communication Style

I believe in open and direct communication. While I embrace asynchronous communication for most interactions, I recognize when a quick call can prevent misunderstandings and help set clear expectations. Slack is the best way to reach me, and I typically respond very promptly. I value meetings that drive toward actionable outcomes and ensure everyone walks away with a clear understanding of next steps. Feel free to reach out anytime to discuss ideas, challenges, or just to connect. I appreciate when people share context and are open to exploring different perspectives, as this often leads to more innovative solutions. Don't hesitate to ask questions or challenge assumptions – some of our best ideas come from these discussions.

### What I'm Currently Working On

I'm currently focused on several key initiatives that drive efficiency and value across the organization:

- Leading the expansion of our Robotic Process Automation (RPA) program through new project deployments that increase organizational ROI and operational efficiency. This includes standardizing the RPA program framework to enable scaling beyond the finance team.
- Enhancing G&A systems to optimize processes across the finance organization, with a focus on streamlining workflows and improving user experience.
- Collaborating closely with compliance and audit teams to ensure proper documentation and maintain robust control frameworks across our systems and processes.
- Supporting and prioritizing daily operational activities for all financial systems to ensure seamless cross-functional workflows.
