## NEW ‚ö°Ô∏è GitLab Field Flash: April 2021 Edition ‚ö°Ô∏è

In this month's [Field Flash](/handbook/sales/field-communications/field-flash-newsletter/#overview), you'll find important Field Operations process updates and improvements, six new competitive resources, a new IDC study that features GitLab, our first IBM Cloud Paks customer win and more.

And, we learn more about Sales Development Representative Danielle Madry in her team member spotlight.

### Get the Latest ‚Äì Field Ops Updates

As we work to close out Q1-FY22, Field Ops has announced multiple updates to help streamline your processes. Review the summary below to ensure you‚Äôre up-to-date:

1. **President‚Äôs Club Criteria -** Eligibility criteria for President‚Äôs Club 2022 has been announced. Check out the [Club handbook page](/handbook/sales/club/) for more details. We hope to see you at the Ritz-Carlton Grand Cayman Islands Resort in May 2022!
1. **Q1 QBR Cannonball Run -** Field Ops just wrapped up their latest Cannonball Run to quickly respond to high-priority QBR asks: Rules of Engagement Updates, SFDC Reporting, SFDC Hygiene & Process Improvement, Discount Approval Update and New Refund creation process in SFDC. [See the issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/issues/2077) for more details, and see the full list of Q1 QBR asks in the [Ask Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/issues/1977).
1. **Starter End of Availability Tracking -** To ensure we‚Äôre capturing Sales‚Äô engagement with our EoA customers, all EoA customers can now be tracked in SFDC leveraging the ‚ÄúFY22 On Starter/Bronze‚Äù field. Please review the process changes and corresponding reports in the [Go To Market handbook page](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/).
1. **Starter End of Availability SLA -** Due to the extreme volume of EoA Ramp Deal requests, Deal Desk has published an SLA specifically for these requests. Please review the [handbook entry](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#sla-for-eoa-ramp-deal-requests) for more information.
1. **Improvements to #wins and #wins-key-deals Channels -** We are leveraging a new tool (Troops) to improve the readability of the alerts in these channels. You will now see alerts that provide a more holistic view of the won deal, highlighting key deal information without the need to click.

### What's New in GitLab üöÄ

The GitLab 13.10 release is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:

- **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk:** Teams can reduce the overhead of managing and sharing vulnerabilities with Bulk Status Updates that allow security teams to modify the status of multiple vulnerabilities simultaneously. They can also identify and triage relevant information quicker with improvements to vulnerability reports and the vulnerability trends chart. When issues do arise, customers can now more efficiently handle them with tools to help integrate and manage alerts from multiple monitoring solutions and enhancements to disaster recovery for customers using GitLab Geo.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** The GitLab Runner Operator is generally available in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform! Check out and share this [step-by-step demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNBc_QnDUu4) and [blog post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/davie-street-enterprises-embraces-gitops-gitlab) from Red Hat that explore how to install and configure the GitLab Runner Operator. Also, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BNfuVWYDts) from IBM on configuring GitLab Runner on OpenShift.
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** GitLab leveled-up support for DORA metrics in 13.10 with new functionalities to track and identify blockers across a portfolio of projects including an API to track lead time for changes and Deployment Frequency metrics via API at the group level.
