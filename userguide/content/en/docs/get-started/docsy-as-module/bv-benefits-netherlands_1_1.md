## Medical

### Medical Allowance

Effective 1 August 2023, Full-Time Netherlands team members will be paid a gross monthly allowance of 100 Euros to subsidize healthcare costs.

Team Members will still need to purchase their own health insurance package (basisverzekering) with a health insurance company, as required by the Netherland's statutory healthcare system. If you do not have health insurance, you can be fined by the Sociale Verzekeringsbank.

Team Members will automatically receive the allowance via payroll. No documentation is needed to receive the allowance. The allowance is subject to taxes, which payroll will withhold on a monthly basis.

The allowance will be prorated for New Hires that start in the middle of the month and terminations that are effective in the middle of the month. Team members on sick pay or unpaid parental leave will still receive the monthly allowance. Team members who are on other unpaid leaves will not receive the stipend during their leave.

### Medical Collective Healthcare Policy

GitLab has partnered with [CZ](https://www.cz.nl/en) to offer GitLab Team Members a collective healthcare policy in the Netherlands, effective 2023-10-01
The collective policy offers discounted rates for team members towards their supplementary insurance policies.

Instructions on enrolling on the policy, the policy number, and ID can be found on the [Netherlands CZ Collective Policy Enrollment Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1waw2rNECdmsinqqmtj4XNuL0zMQvFeyI17-0YBvKURM/edit).
The policy number is also listed on the [CZ Insurance document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1waw2rNECdmsinqqmtj4XNuL0zMQvFeyI17-0YBvKURM/edit).

Team Members can include their dependents on the collective agreement as well.
Team members who join the plan will be able to pay CZ directly through their own bank account through invoice or direct debit. For more details on the policy please see the [GitLab CZ page](https://www.cz.nl/collectief/015418634)

In 2023 only, current Team Members can join the plan mid-year, starting in 2024 current Team Members can only enroll in the plans during the enrollment period at the end of each year. Team members must cancel their old insurance before January 1 and take out new insurance before February 1, you will be insured with a retroactive effective from January 1.

## Pension

State pension (AOW) is standard and will be paid out at retirement age. Starting January 1, 2021, GitLab will offer a private pension plan through [ASR](https://asr.nl/doenpensioen)(formerly Brand New Day) for all team members over the age of 21 employed via a GitLab BV Netherlands employment contract. The pension plan will be a Defined Contribution Agreement with a flat rate of 5.00% of the pension base. The GitLab team member will contribute 2%, with the employer (GitLab) contributing 3%. The pension base equals the pensionable salary less the state pension offset. For additional training, ASR has provided [video](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qjCicb0JxnCmG5i4l3Hv5CEs5q8mOuXX?usp=sharing) explanations on how the pension plan works.

**Pension Plan Summary:**

- Pension: The Pension plan is designed for team members to build up an invested pension fund that they cash in to purchase a retirement
pension and a partner's pension that pays benefits upon their death after their retirement via monthly contributions.
- Death Benefits: If a team member dies while in service and before the retirement date, the partner and/or children will receive death benefits. This is a life-long partner's pension for the spouse and a temporary dependant's pension for their children which pays benefits on the death of the team member. For more information on this please review section 8 of the [Pension Scheme](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FaC8sHe-r_PHz4xrXbNYlH2zCHAU972h/view?usp=sharing)

The beneficiary is also entitled to additional lifelong partner's pension that is bough by the invested pension capital upon death. See article 18of the [Pension Scheme](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FaC8sHe-r_PHz4xrXbNYlH2zCHAU972h/view?usp=sharing)

- Incapacity for Work: This is a waiver of premium for incapacity for work. If a team member becomes partially or fully incapacitated for
work, this portion of the plan continues to pay part or all of the pension contributions for team members to keep building up their pension fund and remain covered for the elected benefits.

**Voluntary Pension Plan Summary:**

- Extra Pension: Team members can make additional voluntary contributions to have extra funds to purchase a retirement pension and a partner's pension that pays benefits upon their death after retirement.
- Extra Death Benefits: Team members with a partner have the option of insuring an extra partner's pension upon their death prior to the retirement date. The following [2024 doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vHUp7koRsOMVZk87uMGIpU8QJ0NhRE7x/edit) outlines additional information on how the voluntary ANW-gap pension works.

**Individual value transfer:**

A team member can have the pension value accrued at a former employer transferred to ASR. An individual value transfer must be requested from ASR within six months of joining the scheme. Once this is complete, the years of service at any former employers count towards Death Benefits.

**Investment Profile:**

Team members choose their own investment profile: neutral, defensive or offensive or their own mix of equities and bonds, within the limits set by ASR. Furthermore, you can choose to put all the contributions in a savings fund.

## Accident Policy

Effective November 1, 2022, all team members in the Netherlands will be enrolled in GitLab's Group Accident Insurance Policy with Hienfeld.

This cover provides peace of mind in the event of an accident. All team members are automatically enrolled at no cost to you.  The insured benefit per person is 2x annual salary in case of death or permanent disability due to an accident (maximum annual salary 250,000 euro per person.) You can find the General Terms and Conditions in [English](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10zMEoicyznarbiT_sJbwdKoQOdJb2rNK/view?usp=sharing) & [Dutch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11dIBfZoIEIavIBYg-gWu7iZUbSxrnPJd/view?usp=sharing).

Because the insurance also pays out in case you pass away due to an accident, we urge you to inform your spouse about this benefit as well.

In the unfortunate event of an accident, please fill in the claim form and send it to total-rewards@gitlab.com as soon as possible. In case of death at least 36 hours before the funeral or cremation. The form is available both in [English](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1btOAO8HaIndD3rNyy2ZGM2v6pOqd5qet/view?usp=sharing) and [Dutch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TXDy9-OHgifVUtBht_vWoQ8Vdnr59pMe/view?usp=sharing)

Intern Coverage is a flat coverage amount: 50,000 Euro upon accidental death and 50,000 Euro in case of permanent disability.

## 30% Tax Ruling

Eligible team members may apply for the 30% Tax Ruling. More information can be found on our [Visas](/handbook/people-group/visas/#30-ruling-in-the-netherlands) page. Kindly note, this can also be [expensed](/handbook/people-group/visas/#expensing).

## Bike to Work/Tax Saver Commuter Scheme

GitLab uses HR Savvy to assist with the administration of [the bike to work/tax saver commuter scheme](https://business.gov.nl/running-your-business/environmental-impact/making-your-business-sustainable/buy-or-lease-a-company-bicycle/).

Effective 15-02-2024, The Cycle to work plan's maximum purchase limit will increase to 2000 EUR for a bike. The team members can avail this benefit every 2 years. This duration will be calculated based on the start date of the previously availed bike scheme benefit.

*Bike Applications:*

1. Send an email to HR Savvy (`payroll@savvy-group.eu`) to request participation in the scheme. In the email, mention the bike of your choice and accessories (if required).
1. HR Savvy will stage an addendum to the employment contract. Once signed by GitLab and the team member, HR Savvy will send a copy to Payroll and Total Rewards.
1. HR Savvy will purchase the bike on behalf of GitLab and send the invoice to Payroll.
1. Payroll will reduce the team member's gross salary by the cost of the bike as per the addendum.

If a team member would want to purchase a bike more expensive than the 2000 EUR maximum the process is as follows:

- HRSavvy will invoice the seller for the entirety of the bike.
- The difference between the cost of the bike and 2000 EUR will be deducted from the team member's net salary.
- This means the team member will only have a tax benefit over the first 2000 euro.

## GitLab B.V. Netherlands Leave Policy

  - 'Person' means the following individuals: the team member's (grand)children, the team member's foster children living at his or her home, the spouse, registered partner or person with who the team member cohabits unmarried, a child living at home with the spouse, registered partner or person with who the team member cohabits unmarried, the team member's (grand)parents or brother/sister, others with who the team member has a social relationship (e.g. boyfriend, girlfriend, good neighbour) and persons who are part of the team member's household but are not a parent, child or partner (and not roommates with who there is a commercial or employment relationship).
  - Team members are entitled to a maximum of twice the number of their normal weekly hours agreed upon in their employment contract, per 12-month period. For example, if a team member’s contract states that they have a 40-hour work week, then that team member may take 80 hours of short-term care leave in one 12-month period.

### Applying for Leave in the Netherlands

HRSavvy can assist in applying for maternity leave covered by social security. In this application the company can decide whether the benefit is paid to the team member directly, or the employer continues paying the salary and receives the benefit. The last option is done in most of the cases.

### Administration for Group Accident Policy

The Group Accident Policy is based on calculation in arrears. At the end of the insurance year, Hienfeld will send by post (in dutch) a letter with information requesting details to perform the premium payment in arrears. Once this letter is received, Total Rewards will send the letter to our HR Savvy contact, agnes@savvy-group.eu. HR Savvy will use the payroll data to share the updated Employee details with Heinfeld to calculate the final premium of previous years and a supplmentary premium is invoiced.

On the invoice, a bank account number will be provided to pay the annual premium.
Total Rewards will send the invoice to Accounts Payable for payment.

Payroll will add the allowance to New Hires' pay.
