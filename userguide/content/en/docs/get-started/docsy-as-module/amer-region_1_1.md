## Overview

This page is meant to serve as documentation for information relevant
specifically to the Americas (AMER) portion of the global Licensing & Renewals
(L&R) Support Team. All specific regional goals, team structure, processes,
etc., from AMER should be documented here for clarity, transparency and
ease of collaboration.

## Our team's definition of success

Starting in FY23 Q4, the AMER L&R Team defines its success as:

### Each SE is consistently able to devote appropriate attention to all aspects of the support engineer role

Key aspects of the success will be:

1. Working consistently in accordance with a documented set of guidelines for
   accepting and prioritizing tickets
1. Restoring and maintaining a proper scope of ticket work:
   1. No hacks, including Mechanizer
   1. No Sales support, only customer support
   1. No policy-making
1. Making decisions according to a philosophy of: **If it's not supported we
   don't support it**
   - if the product can't do something, we won't support doing that thing with
     a hack or a workaround or anything else
