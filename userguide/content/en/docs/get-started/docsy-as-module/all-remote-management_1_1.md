Documentation also helps with transparency, which is critical to remote work. While decisions made around office water coolers may be familiar in traditional workplaces, input is limited to those present. Those who are not present feel left out, and you’re missing an opportunity to hear different perspectives.

The GitLab way of working is more inclusive. By documenting everything, no one is left out of the conversation and a diverse set of perspectives can be heard, not only from GitLab team members but also from customers and community contributors.

## Scaling by documenting

<!-- Unsupported block type: video -->

In the interview above between GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij and The New Stack’s Alex Williams, Sid explains the importance of “handbook first” when it comes to maintaining velocity and efficiency in scaling a team.

<!-- Unsupported block type: quote -->

This is one of the harder things to apply on a daily basis. Taking the time to document a solution isn’t very satisfying in the moment, and is easy to deprioritize when other seemingly urgent tasks are vying for your attention.

To relieve tension, empower DRIs to make decisions, and create a more productive future for a team, it’s vital to place a high degree of value on pausing to document. This requires leadership to praise and reward the act of documenting, measuring these contributions as diligently as one would measure sales or conversions.

This applies to all companies, though it can produce outsized gains in all-remote organizations where there are fewer opportunities for information to be shared in a physical space.

This also requires humility, and a recognition that human memories aren’t perfect. It’s impossible to predict the future, but documenting a solution as soon as it is discovered guarantees that the answer will be available should it ever be needed later.

## Asynchronous

<!-- Unsupported block type: image -->

When you open your talent acquisition pipeline to the world, you create an opportunity to hire people in an array of time zones. The ability to hand projects off across time zones is a competitive advantage, but minimizing disconnects, frustrations, and awkwardly-timed meetings requires an intentional approach.

### Active reinforcement

The first step in creating an atmosphere where colleagues are comfortable working asynchronously is to avoid the default mentality as it applies to meetings. By making meetings optional, recording and documenting everything, being diligent to follow an agenda, and leveraging tools like GitLab Issues and Slack, all-remote companies are less reliant on colleagues being online at the same time.

This mentality must be actively reinforced. For example, in team social calls where dozens of people join a video chat to bond as a team, an agenda allows those who cannot make it to add shout-outs or discussion points that a fellow colleague can verbalize. This is an intentional approach to not only working asynchronously, but socializing asynchronously.

Leonardo Federico, co-founder at Sametab, offers an interesting perspective on asynchronous communication, noting that it provides more optionality.

### Benefits for morale, well-being, and lowering stress

<!-- Unsupported block type: video -->

Emna G., founder and CEO at Veamly and GitLab’s Darren M. discuss why asynchronous is the future.

<!-- Unsupported block type: quote -->

There are considerations that go beyond productivity metrics. Companies should ask if demanding synchronous communication is impacting their team’s ability to reason and process challenges in the most efficient and healthy way.

<!-- Unsupported block type: quote -->

Asynchronous communication alone will not solve challenges associated with remote work, but it is a useful tool in a wider arsenal of tactics to avoid issues such as burnout.

### Time and productivity

When referencing time and productivity, Remote CTO Marcelo Lebre shares a potent thought on asynchronous communication in a relevant blog post.

## Separating decision gathering from decision making

<!-- Unsupported block type: image -->

GitLab collaboration illustration

Paralysis by analysis is something all companies should seek to avoid. In managing through this at an all-remote company, leaders should ensure that all colleagues understand that consensus doesn’t scale.

Thus, there should be no goal to achieve consensus. This may feel awkward or unnatural to those coming from colocated corporate environments, but trusting decision makers and living out the value of iteration prevents unnecessary slowdowns in your organization.

By intentionally separating the process of decision gathering and decision making, you provide ample opportunity for everyone to add input, offering up fresh angles for consideration that may well sway the mind of the DRI (directly responsible individual).

It is vital for all-remote companies to foster an atmosphere of trust and learning, such that grudges are not held against decision makers after decision gathering has occurred. At GitLab, this is manifested in our Collaboration value, which includes kindness, sharing, short toes, no ego, and assuming positive intent.

## Applying iteration to everything

Iteration is oft applied to engineering, but asking only part of the company to iterate can create discord. All-remote companies must empower every member of the team, across every function and job level, to approach their work with an iterative mindset.

By applying iteration to everything, it removes the barrier of fear and judgement. It also enables faster cycles, and it makes miscues far less damaging.

For example, don’t write a large plan, only write the first step. Trust that you’ll know better how to proceed after something is released. Iteration can be uncomfortable, even painful. If you’re doing iteration correctly, it should be.

Instilling this in an all-remote team is difficult. Most people are naturally inclined to only showcase polished work. In turn, managing this aspect of an all-remote team requires reminders that it’s preferred to share unfinished work.

Leaders should work diligently to ensure that teams have a low level of shame and believe that everything is in draft and subject to change.

Learn more about GitLab’s value of iteration in our Handbook, and read how one team used survey results to iterate on culture.

## Company-wide organizational chart

There are no corner offices in an all-remote company. Although you should consider the organizational structure that makes the most sense for you (and iterate as the company evolves), one thing that should not change is the level of transparency.

To give each member of the company an equal view of how the organization is structured, how job levels/families are established, and what reporting structures look like, it’s wise to consider an org chart accessible to all team members.

This removes ambiguity and enables clearer lines of communication.

We invite other all-remote companies to mirror GitLab’s approach to publishing its team structure.

## Avoiding dotted lines and matrix organization

<!-- Unsupported block type: video -->

In the video above, published on GitLab’s YouTube channel, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij and Arch Systems CEO Andrew Scheuermann discuss structure within distributed companies.

In all-remote companies, it is easy to fall into a situation where you work with a day-to-day lead but report to someone else. There are no physical office structures to reinforce reporting structures.

Leaders in an all-remote company must work to avoid dotted lines and matrix organization. Everyone should report to exactly one person, and that person should understand your day-to-day tasks and be well-positioned to assist you in removing obstacles to thriving in your role.

Whenever there is need to work on a specific, high-level, cross functional business problem, a working group should be established for that need.

Learn more about GitLab’s approach in the Leadership section of our Handbook.

## Focusing on results

<!-- Unsupported block type: video -->

In the video above, published to GitLab’s YouTube channel, members of the engineering team demonstrate a focus on metrics.

Perhaps the easiest way to avoid overanalyzing management in an all-remote company is to focus on results. Focusing on results over hours worked creates an atmosphere where colleagues direct effort on the right things — shipping great code, making a client happy, solving a teammate’s problem, etc.

This enables team members to complete their work and turn their attention to non-work activities (family, exercise, reading, caregiving, philanthropy, etc.) as quickly as possible.

By focusing on results, each team member has less of a mental burden to carry. They’re aware that results are what matter as opposed to items like personal success, status, and ego.

Learn more on GitLab’s Results value in our Handbook.

### Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

All-remote companies should go beyond striving for results. They should add as much detail and clarity as possible to what those results are, and what is measured along the way.

This can be achieved by implementing Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), a widely used framework for setting strategy and removing ambiguity over what matters.

Learn more about GitLab’s implementation of OKRs.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Managing results requires clear communication of what’s being measured. KPIs strip away guesswork and allow global teams to look at uniform data for making decisions.

It’s vital that all-remote companies make KPIs available to all. This not only helps each team member focus their efforts on driving results that move needles that matter, but it creates empathy.

Although KPIs are emotionless, allowing teams to understand what other teams are working towards creates an atmosphere of compassion, and enables team members to more easily offer help that is specific to an indicator.

Learn more about KPIs at GitLab.

## Encourage flexibility and balance

In a conversation with GitLab’s Head of Remote about company values, community contributor JD Lewin suggested that much of what leaders concern themselves with (surrounding management) can be addressed by creating a respectful work atmosphere.

When considering a new employer, he noticed that many conversations focused on the work rather than the environment. His articulation of this was powerful, and is transcribed with permission below.

## Getting started: the early days of remote management

Leaders should ensure that new remote hires read a getting started guide, and make themselves available to answer questions throughout one’s journey with the company.

Tomasz Tunguz describes it as such in an article entitled “The early discipline of remote startups.”
