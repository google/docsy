The `max-preview-image` meta tag controls how large of an image preview is displayed when a page is shared on platforms like search engines or social media. 

The syntax for the tag looks like this:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="max-preview-image:large">
```

Here's what the key parts mean:

- **`max-preview-image`**: This is the specific directive to control image preview size.
- **`large`**: This value allows the largest image preview possible to appear. Other possible values include `standard` or `none`:
  - `large`: Shows a large preview image if available.
  - `standard`: Shows a smaller preview image.
  - `none`: Prevents any image preview.

This tag can help in situations where you want to emphasize visual content in search results, as a larger image preview can increase engagement or make content more appealing to users.
