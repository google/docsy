# site map
- A sitemap is a file where you provide information about the pages, videos, and other files on your site, and the relationships between them. Search engines like Google read this file to crawl your site more efficiently. A sitemap tells search engines which pages and files you think are important in your site, and also provides valuable information about these files. For example, when the page was last updated and any alternate language versions of the page.
- If your site's pages are properly linked, Google can usually discover most of your site without the need to create site map file. Proper linking means that all pages that you deem important can be reached through some form of navigation, be that your site's menu or links that you placed on pages
- If you're using a CMS such as WordPress, Wix, or Blogger, it's likely that your CMS has already made a sitemap available to search engines and you don't have to do anything.
- However, in most cases, your site will benefit from having a sitemap.

**You might need a sitemap if:**

- Your site is large. 
- Your site is new and has few external links to it. 
- Your site has a lot of rich media content (video, images) or is shown in Google News.

**You might not need a sitemap if:**

- Your site is "small". By small, we mean about 500 pages or fewer on your site. Only pages that you think need to be in search results count toward this total.
- Your site is comprehensively linked internally. This means that Googlebot can find all the important pages on your site by following links starting from the home page.
- You don't have many media files (video, image) or news pages that you want to show in search results. Sitemaps can help Google find and understand video and image files, or news articles, on your site. If you don't need these results to appear in Search you might not need a sitemap.
