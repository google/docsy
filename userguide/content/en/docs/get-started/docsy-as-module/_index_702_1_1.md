{{< design-document-header >}}

GitLab and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provide complementary tooling which we
are integrating via our [partnership](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/08/29/gitlab-google-partnership-s3c/).

This design doc is not public at that time. The whole content is
available in [GitLab-internal project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/architecture/gitlab-gcp-integration/design-doc).
