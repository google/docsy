To protect our intellectual property rights and our reputation, we are careful about how our trademarks can be used.

These Trademark Guidelines ("**Guidelines**") apply to all trademarks of GitLab Inc. and its affiliates ("**GitLab Inc.**", "**we**", "**us**", and "**our**"), including the GITLAB name (the "**GitLab Name**"); the [Core Logo](https://design.gitlab.com/brand-logo/core-logo/), [Logomark](https://design.gitlab.com/brand-logo/logomark/), and [Wordmark](https://design.gitlab.com/brand-logo/core-logo/#wordmark) (the "**Logos**"); and all other registered and unregistered trademarks (collectively, the "**Trademarks**").

Use of the Logos is not permitted under these Guidelines, except for the limited purpose set out in Section 3.1. below. To request use of the Trademarks in a manner, or for purposes, not expressly permitted in these Guidelines, email [intellectualproperty@gitlab.com](mailto:intellectualproperty@gitlab.com).

### **1. Use of the Trademarks**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.1.1. To indicate if your product, service, or solution integrates, or is interoperable or compatible, with GitLab, e.g. `This product is an issue downloader for GitLab`, provided that doing so does not create a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of such product, service, or solution. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.1.2. In the name of a plugin or extension that is interoperable or compatible with GitLab, provided that:

- The GitLab Name is not used as the first word;
- Only the phrases, "...for GitLab", or "GitLab Compatible" are used;
- The following statement is included in the overview section of the marketplace listing:
  - `This [plugin/extension] is not affiliated, endorsed, sponsored, or approved with or by GitLab Inc.`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.1.3. To refer to GitLab Inc. and its products and services in news articles and other text without alteration, e.g. `GitLab acquires open source observability distribution Opstrace`;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.1.4. To use "GitLab" as an adjective before a noun, e.g. `GitLab issue boards`; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.1.5. As part of a public subdomain solely for the purpose of serving as the URL for a self-managed GitLab instance, e.g. `gitlab.companyname.com`.

1.2. When using the GitLab Name in accordance with this section, you must:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2.1. Comply with these Guidelines, and the design guidelines available at [design.gitlab.com](https://design.gitlab.com) which are incorporated into these Guidelines by reference;

### **2. Prohibited Use of the Trademarks**

2.1. Unless otherwise expressly permitted in these Guidelines, you must never:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.1. Use the Trademarks in the name of your business, product, service, app, domain name, email username, social media account, or business indicator, even if such use otherwise complies with Section 1.1.1., is prohibited, except for use of the GitLab Name in the name of a plugin or extension to indicate interoperability or compatibility with GitLab's product in accordance with Section 1.1.2.;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.2. Inaccurately imply an affiliation, endorsement, sponsorship, or approval with or by GitLab Inc., or use the Trademarks in a manner that is considered deceptive, unethical, illegal, or is detrimental to us in any way;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.3. Alter, animate, distort, or misappropriate the Trademarks, for example, by combining the Trademarks with other terms or content, misspelling them, or incorporating them into a tagline or slogan;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.4. Use the Trademarks as nouns or verbs in a common, descriptive, or generic way;

### **3. Use for distributing GitLab Community Edition software**

GitLab Community Edition (CE) software is available under a free and open source MIT license. This license does not cover use of the Trademarks. We’re mindful that our trademarks are an important identifier to the GitLab community for the quality and origin of our products, and that modified versions of the CE software, or instances where unmodified CE software is offered as part of a managed service, may confuse users if they don’t receive the same features and standard of service as they would get if they downloaded the CE software directly from us or use a managed GitLab service hosted by GitLab or one of GitLab’s trusted partners.

3.1. **Distribution of unmodified software:** When you distribute an unmodified copy of the CE software as downloaded from GitLab, you may retain any of the Trademarks, including the Logos, that we have included in the CE software, subject always to the prohibitions in Section 2.

3.2.  **Distribution of modified software:** When you distribute a modified version of the CE software, or host a modified or unmodified version of the CE software as a managed service, you:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2.1. may make use of the GitLab Name in accordance with applicable law to truthfully and accurately refer to, or identify, GitLab and its products and services, including to indicate if your product, service, or solution is complementary to, or integrates, or is interoperable or compatible, with GitLab, e.g. `[Your brand name] managed service for GitLab`, provided that doing so does not (i) create a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of such product, service, or solution; nor (ii) inaccurately imply an affiliation, endorsement, sponsorship, or approval with or by GitLab Inc.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2.2. may not use any of the Logos; any Logos present in the software must be removed and you may not use any Logos on the CE software or on any marketing or other materials related thereto,  and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2.3. must include the following statement on the software:

`This product is based on GitLab software. GITLAB is a trademark of GitLab Inc. in the United States and other countries and regions.`

### **4. Other terms**

4.1. GitLab Inc. retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Trademarks, and you agree never to challenge, contest, or question the validity, or GitLab Inc.'s exclusive ownership, of the Trademarks.

4.2. In the event of inconsistency between these Guidelines and the terms of any other agreement governing your relationship with GitLab Inc., or the use of the Trademarks, the provisions of such other agreement will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

4.3. GitLab reserves the right in its sole discretion to (i) terminate, revoke, modify, or otherwise change permission to use the Trademarks at any time and; (ii) object to any use or misuse of the Trademarks in any jurisdiction worldwide. All changes to these Guidelines are effective immediately when posted, and your continued use of the Trademarks following the posting of revised Guidelines signifies your acceptance of such revision.
