### FS module
- it allows you to work with your file system in your pc
- when you require it, it returns <mark>fs object</mark>

```js
const fs = require("node:fs");
```

### readFileSync()
- read content of a file in synchronous way (js engine will read all of the file content before moving to the next line of the code)
- takes the <mark>path to the file</mark> you want to read
- it returns a buffer with binary data
- to view it pass a second argument which is the <mark>typeOfEncoding</mark> e:i <mark>utf-8</mark>

```js
fileContent = fs.readFileSync("./file.txt", "utf-8");
console.log(fileContent)
```

there is another method allows us to read file contents asynchronously but don't just use it every time you want to read a file, <mark>think about your useCase</mark> sometime it may be better to read files synchronously like if you need the file content before moving on to the next line e:g configuration file that you will be using along the code

### readFile()
- this is the method we use to read asynchronously
- it takes the <mark>file path</mark> <mark>encoding method</mark> and a <mark>callback</mark> that will be invoked when the file content has been read
- this call-back takes two args, the first is <mark>errorArg</mark> which is the error that is identified while reading the file if there is any, if there is no error it set to null and the other argument e:i <mark>data</mark> is populated with the file content
- this pattern of using callbacks where the first argument is the error is called <mark>error first call-back function</mark>
```js
fs.readFile("./path", "utf-8", (error, data) => {
    if (error) {
        console.log("error occur")
    } else {
        console.log(data)
    }
})
```

### writeFileSync()
- to write into the file synchronously
- if file don't exist it creates it
```js
fs.writeFileSync("./filePath/filename", "fileContentToWrite")
```

### writeFile()
- to write to a file asynchronously
- accpet filepath, fileContent and a call-back
```js
fs.writeFile("./file", "content", (error) => {
    if (error) {
        // do something
    } else {
        // log data has been written to a file
    }
})
```

### appending to a file
- if you want to append to the end of the file you can add a third argument which is an <mark>object</mark> that reset flag as append
```js
fs.writeFile("./file", "content", {flag: "a"}, (err) => {

})
```

although writeFile() and readFile() do the job when we want to read or write asynchronously, node js decided to add a promise based FS module to handle these
