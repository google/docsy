title: Intermediate Frontend Engineer
---

Frontend Engineers at GitLab work on our product. This includes both the open source version of GitLab, the enterprise editions, and the GitLab.com service as well. They work with peers on teams dedicated to areas of the product. They work together with product managers, designers, and [backend engineers](/job-families/engineering/backend-engineer/) to solve common goals.

## Responsibilities

- Develop features and improvements to the GitLab product in a secure, well-tested, and performant way
- You'll work with Product Management and other stakeholders (Backend, UX, etc.) to iterate on new features within the GitLab product.
- Craft code that meets our internal standards for style, maintainability, and best practices for a high-scale web environment. Maintain and advocate for these standards through code review.
- Consistently ship small features and improvements with minimal guidance and support from other team members. Collaborate with the team on larger projects.
- Help improve the overall experience of our product through improving the quality of the Frontend features both in your [group](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy) and features that benefit other groups.
- You'll help identify areas of improvements in the code base, both specific to your [group](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy) and outside your group (eg. component library) and help contribute to make it better
- You'll learn, collaborate and teach other Frontend Engineers. Everyone can contribute something new to the team regardless of how long they've been in the industry.
- You'll fix prioritized issues from the issue tracker. These are typically bugs listed in a GitLab issue with an attached severity and priority label.
- You'll contribute to and follow our workflow process, alongside the rest of the Frontend Engineers and the GitLab community as a whole.
