## Technical Program Management Context and Mission

### Context

As we incorporate more program management functions at GitLab, we want to ensure our role, vision, and responsibilities are clear. There are currently Program Managers in Product, IT, Infrastructure within the R&D, along with other areas of the business. We want to ensure there are clear boundaries for each of these program managers and work cross-functionally to align on best practices, process, and overall efficiency across the various programs.

### Mission

Our mission as program managers is to own the execution of cross-functional initiatives that are critical to the business. We lead programs from start to finish to help GitLab meet our organizational goals.
Program managers develop strategies, evaluate the performance of projects, keep teams organized, and allocate budgets and resources across projects. Program managers may oversee several different teams, all working toward different goals and separate work schedules. We take the lead on tracking project progress, aligning team members, and strategizing program outcomes.

## Core Competencies

Technical Program Managers drive complex and cross-functional technical initiatives by leveraging domain expertise, building a holistic execution strategy and harnessing human leadership qualities to deliver strategic business outcomes that have wide-reaching impact.

The role of TPM can mean different things at different organizations. At GitLab, TPMs should be proficient in 5 core competencies:

### Communication

* Communicates efficiently and effectively, with the intent to drive clarity across stakeholders

* Adapts communication style, approach, and channel to different audiences, from technical team members to executive leadership

* Creates documentation that distills technical requirements, decision and risks, communication cascades, and other project components

* Keeps communication focused on impacts and outcomes

### Critical Thinking

* Is not an order taker or a “cat herder.” Instead, applies and fosters an environment of analytical thinking in regards to project goals, prioritization, execution, and decision making.

* Leads the charge in collaboratively solving problems and driving towards outcomes that are best for the business

* Leads projects outside of immediate domain expertise by learning about the work and self-educating about the problem to be solved

### Organization & Execution

* Executes projects and programs end-to-end, from inception to release

* Keeps a variety of disparate and ever-changing project components and stakeholders aligned

* Switches between a range of context and corresponding responsibilities with ease, from vision and goal setting to managing operational cadences

### Relationship-Building

* Creates a trusted reputation across the organization with a variety of stakeholders (for both themselves and program management as a function)

* Exercises influence without direct authority (ie without a management or a leadership title)

* Builds a network of champions for the project/program throughout the organization

* Collaborates with team members and stakeholders in a way that drives business outcomes and earns stakeholder trust

### Technical Knowledge & Application

* Understands organizational systems, architecture, and applications and how they fit together into an enterprise tech stack
* Connects the dots between upstream decisions and downstream impacts to people, process, and technology
* Has and or creates domain expertise
* Applies program management methodologies and best practices, but knows how and when to flex to the project rather than simply following rigid standards.
