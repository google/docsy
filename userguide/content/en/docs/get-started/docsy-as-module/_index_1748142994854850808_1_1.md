title: Slack Apps
---

GitLab has chosen to restrict the ability to install apps, and we have a process to approve or restrict certain apps for our workspace. In order to integrate a new app with existing applications in our [tech stack](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml) such as Google, Slack or Zoom you need to create a [Third Party Risk Management issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-risk-team/third-party-vendor-security-management/-/issues/new).

Once the TPRM issue has been approved by all parties, please request approval to add the app to Slack following the steps below:

1. Open a [CorpSec Slack app request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=slack_app_create#) in our tracker to request integration.
1. Within Slack, scroll to the "Apps" section. Click the "+ Add apps".
1. Search for the app that you would like to add, and click "Add".
1. A web browser will open. Please click on Add to Slack.
1. Add a custom message with more context about your request and also link the TPRM approval issue+CorpSec issue.
1. Click Submit. You'll receive a direct message from Slackbot when your request has been reviewed by the team.
