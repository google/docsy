### What's New in GitLab üöÄ

The GitLab 13.8 release is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:

- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** Customers can improve their DevOps maturity with deployment frequency metrics in their CI/CS analytics. This is the first of the [DORA 4 metrics](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/devops-metrics/) that GitLab will add to the product in the coming year in a mission to help customers free up time traditionally spent on instrumenting their systems to capture and report on these metrics so they can focus on measuring and optimizing their DevOps practices instead.
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** In 13.8, GitLab is taking the first step in our vision to create a visual pipeline authoring experience for CI/CD that reduces complexity, letting customers quickly create and edit pipelines while still exposing advanced options when they need them. The new Pipeline Editor will include enhanced functionality like built-in linting and configuration validation as well as a pipeline visualizer, all allowing new users to get started with GitLab CI/CD quickly and make experienced power users more efficient.

[Visit the 13.8 Release Post for more details](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/01/22/gitlab-13-8-released/)

To see what's ahead in 13.9, watch the [kickoff video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYX-thYThCo) or check out the [kickoff review page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/kickoff/).

### Team Member Spotlight üî¶

#### [Evon Collett - Partner Help Desk Specialist](/handbook/company/team/#ecollett)

![Evon-Collett-TMS-Thumb](/handbook/sales/field-communications/field-flash-newsletter/images/Evon_Collett_TMS_Thumb.png)

**Where did you grow up, and where are you based now?**

I grew up mostly in West Richland, Washington. I am now based in Lehi, Utah (USA), living with my two youngest brothers.

**What is your favorite thing about your job?**

The variety of work and people I get to work with internally and externally! Partners and customers are eager to work with us and that makes work even more exciting.

**Which of GitLab's Values resonates most with you?**

Collaboration. We couldn't have accomplished everything we did last year on the Channel team without the willingness of friends within our team and all the other teams at GitLab supporting us as we figured things out together!

**Do you have a helpful tip for working at GitLab to share?**

Our Partner Support team would love to help out if you have questions about working with Channel Partners, Distributor Quotes, Deal Registrations, etc. Feel free to email us at partnersupport, set up Coffee Chats, or reach out in Slack.

**What is a hobby or skill you have that the team might not know about?**

I love to sing and write songs, but I tend to be shy about performing. One of my stretch goals was to record a fully produced song and release it. I did that with "[Sunshine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_fL8LL7yxQ)", along with a couple YouTube videos of other songs I sang live in a studio. I was terrified, but happy I did it. I'd love to hear from you if you love music, too!

**Icebreaker: What's the last show you binge watched?**

Escape to the Chateau - I'm normally a true-crime lover, but I was amazed that someone bought a dilapidated chateau in France and spent years restoring it and breathing new life into it. I couldn't stop watching!
