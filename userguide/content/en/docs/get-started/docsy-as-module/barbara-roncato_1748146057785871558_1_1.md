### About me

I'm based in Portugal where I share a house with a human, two cats, and one dog.

### My GitLab Story

I joined GitLab in January 2020 as a Business Systems Analyst (BSA) under the Enterprise Applications department. Over time, I progressed to Senior BSA and in 2023, was promoted to Manager of the Program Management Office (PMO) team.

In the past five years, I have participated in 9 different system implementations, supporting either as a BSA or Program Manager. My contributions have ranged from gathering requirements to performing user testing, developing training materials and helping with enablement and adoption.

### My Communication and Work Style

I prepare my work the day before and appreciate having an agenda with context and expectations for meetings to ensure productive discussions. I'm very informal, feel free to tag me in a GitLab issue or ping me on Slack and I’ll respond as soon as possible.

I keep my calendar up to date so anyone can book meetings, my availability should always be visible. I'm online most of the time. With no fixed working hours, I adjust my work schedule based on personal commitments. I may send Slack messages at different times but don’t expect responses outside working hours.

### What I am Working On

I manage the Enterprise Applications project portfolio, lead key company initiatives as a Program Manager (with a focus on the G&A area), facilitate Agile sessions to keep work planned and prioritized, and support my team to help them succeed.
