## Our Commitment to Sustainability

Green Orbit Digital is a purpose-driven digital marketing agency advancing sustainable transformation through innovative communications and space-enabled solutions. As a responsible business, we embed sustainability at the core of our operations and strategy—minimising our environmental impact, championing equity and ethical practices, and delivering long-term value for people, planet, and profit.

This policy complements our Environmental Policy, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy, and Code of Ethics, forming part of a comprehensive suite of sustainability and governance documents that guide our internal operations and external impact.

We recognise our responsibility to protect Earth’s natural systems and promote the long-term sustainability of outer space. In alignment with global frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Scotland’s Space Sustainability Roadmap, the Space4SDGs initiative, and the United Nations Guidelines for the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities (LTS), we are committed to using our influence, operations, and partnerships to drive systemic change for a sustainable future—on Earth and in orbit.

## Defining Sustainability

Sustainability is commonly defined as "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (Brundtland Report, 1987). Our definition embraces three interconnected pillars:

- Environmental Sustainability – Safeguarding ecosystems, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pollution, preserving biodiversity, and promoting resource efficiency and circular economy principles.

- Social Sustainability – Fostering equity, inclusion, justice, wellbeing, and thriving communities through ethical engagement, diversity, and social value creation.

- Economic Sustainability – Supporting long-term, ethical, and resilient economic growth through innovation, inclusive opportunity, and responsible business practices.

## What is Space Sustainability?

Space sustainability refers to the ability to conduct space activities safely, securely, inclusively, and responsibly over the long term. It is essential to ensure that space remains a global commons that benefits all humankind.

Space sustainability includes:

- Avoiding space debris creation and implementing end-of-life disposal plans for satellites and space assets.

- Ensuring equitable access to space, particularly for emerging space nations.

- Promoting peaceful, cooperative, and transparent uses of outer space in accordance with international law.

- Using space-based technologies and data to accelerate sustainable development goals (SDGs) on Earth.

Scotland's approach to space sustainability is defined through three interlinked lenses:

1. Sustainable Earth – Using space assets to monitor the environment, support climate action, and drive nature-based solutions.

1. Sustainable Enterprise – Enabling responsible innovation and inclusive economic growth within the space economy.

1. Sustainable Orbit – Stewarding orbital environments through safe mission design, deorbiting protocols, and space traffic coordination.

## The Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space

As space becomes increasingly congested, contested, and commercially essential, ensuring its long-term sustainability is vital. The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS) defines long-term sustainability as "the ability to maintain the conduct of space activities indefinitely into the future in a manner that realises the objectives of equitable access to the benefits of outer space for all, in accordance with international law."

Green Orbit Digital supports this vision and the 21 voluntary LTS Guidelines adopted by UN COPUOS, which promote:

- Space debris mitigation and implementation of end-of-life planning.

- Transparency and data sharing to support space situational awareness.

- International cooperation and capacity-building for emerging space actors.

- Avoidance of harmful interference, dual-use risks, and irresponsible behaviour in space.

We believe these principles should be embedded in space missions, technologies, policies, and communications, and we work with our clients and partners to champion their implementation.

## The Role of Space4SDGs

The Space4SDGs initiative, led by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), demonstrates how space technologies support the delivery of all 17 SDGs. These include:

- Climate Action (SDG 13) – through Earth observation and early warning systems.

- Zero Hunger (SDG 2) – by enhancing agricultural productivity using satellite data.

- Quality Education (SDG 4) and Gender Equality (SDG 5) – through space-enabled connectivity and inclusion.

- Sustainable Cities (SDG 11) and Clean Energy (SDG 7) – by enabling infrastructure planning and renewable monitoring.

At Green Orbit Digital, we help organisations communicate how their space-enabled solutions contribute to these global goals. We champion space as a driver of sustainability, resilience, and equity.

## Our Environmental Objectives

Green Orbit Digital is committed to achieving ambitious environmental goals, including:

- Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency and carbon-conscious digital infrastructure.

- Educating clients, collaborators, and stakeholders about sustainable digital and space practices.

- Selecting low-impact materials such as FSC-certified, recycled, or digital-first options.

- Setting, reviewing, and transparently reporting on measurable environmental targets each quarter.

## Embedding Sustainability in Everything We Do

Sustainability is a guiding principle across all aspects of our work:

- We advocate for a circular economy in space by promoting reusable platforms, de-orbiting, and sustainable mission design.

- We ensure our marketing communications are transparent, ethical, and free of greenwashing.

- We support public engagement, space literacy, and inclusive narratives that reflect planetary boundaries.

- We use our influence to shape climate-aligned policies in the space, creative, and digital industries.

## Conclusion

Sustainability is not a trend—it is our shared responsibility. At Green Orbit Digital, we view Earth and space as interconnected environments vital to the prosperity of current and future generations.

Through alignment with frameworks such as Space4SDGs, the UN COPUOS LTS Guidelines, and Scotland’s Space Sustainability Roadmap, we aim to catalyse a greener, more inclusive, and resilient future. By embedding sustainability in our services, values, and operations, we empower others to act for the benefit of people, planet, and beyond.
