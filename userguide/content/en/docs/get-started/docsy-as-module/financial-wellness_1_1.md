## Total Rewards and Financial Wellness for Managers

An important component of the [Total Rewards Package](/handbook/total-rewards) is [Equity Compensation](/handbook/total-rewards/stock-options/). Team Members can review their equity holdings in Schwab. Please note that vested and exercised shares are currently being held in Computershare. The Stock Admin team will be providing additional information on these shares.

In order for *managers* to understand the full picture of their team members’ total rewards package, the People Group has generated a [Total Rewards Summary](#total-rewards-summary) for managers to view vested and unvested holdings as of October 14, 2021 for each direct report.

### Total Rewards Summary

The Total Rewards Summary will be available to managers of team members who have been granted equity on or before 2021-09-03. All RSU grants will not be shown on these summaries as the next grant date for RSUs to be reviewed and approved is 2021-12-15.

- Log into [BambooHR](https://gitlab.bamboohr.com/).
- Navigate to the profile of one of your direct reports. Select the Documents tab and expand the `Annual Compensation Review Total Rewards Statements` folder.
- You can either select the linked document name to open a quick view of the Total Rewards Summary in BambooHR or select the download button that appears to the right of the letter. If you are a manager and are unable to see the Documents tab for your team member, please reach out to `total-rewards@ gitlab` and we will review your access level.
- [Total Rewards Summary example](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TxOdKxPuFvTRJIswZQEJTmd5IGEMZgx7/view?usp=sharing)
  - Each summary will have a Cash Compensation section outlining the current (FY22) compensation as of November 1st.
  - For team members who are paid a base salary only, the `Target Bonus (Variable)` column will show `Not Applicable`.
  - Each summary will also have a section for Equity Compensation. The table will show the amount and value of vested and unvested shares held by the team member as of 2021-10-14 with the conversion price detailed on the statement.
- Team Members have access to their own equity holdings, so it’s not required to share the Total Rewards Summary with team members, unless it is useful in facilitating a conversation. To share the letter directly with the team member, select the gear button to the right of the letter, select "Share with Employee", and, in the pop up prompt, select "Share" again.

#### Manager Talking Points

The Total Rewards Summary has been generated for management to visualize and understand the total holdings of their direct reports. There is not a specific timeline for managers to have a conversation around Total Rewards with their direct reports, but we want to ensure managers are enabled to have a conversation as equity is likely top of mind for team members. When going into the conversation we recommend to consider the following points:

- It’s important for all team members to understand and consider all components of the Total Rewards Package. One key component being the value of our equity program (Options, RSU’s & ESPP) as core to our Total Rewards (benefits, cash compensation, equity) at GitLab.
- Equity aligns team members with a long term incentive for the company. By delivering results, GitLab has the ability to contribute to company performance and drive long-term potential value.
- Team members may be eligible for [Equity Compensation](/handbook/total-rewards/stock-options/#restricted-stock-units) as part of their new hire package or the annual refresh program.
- GitLab has recently adjusted the cliff for the RSU program by implementing an industry leading six month cliff for new hire grants and no cliff for promotion or refresh grants.
- Close by checking in on how your team member is doing beyond their financial position. A quick and simple method is to use  the “red, yellow, green” scale to ask your team members how they are feeling about their future at GitLab. The goal is to gain actionable feedback about how you can support them going forward.
- Please note that Total Rewards will be discussed again in February as part of [Annual Compensation Review]({{< ref "compensation-review-cycle" >}}). This is a great opportunity to check in with your direct reports ahead of the planning process, but it is important to not make any forward looking statements on increases during the review cycle.
- Remember, financial incentives are only one aspect of what keeps our team members excited about their role at GitLab. Career opportunity and ability to make meaningful contributions were highlighted as the 2 highest areas of impact for our team members during our last Engagement Survey. Take this opportunity to have a holistic conversation about your team members’ future at GitLab in terms of their career and financial growth opportunity. Remember, we’re only at Mile 3 of the marathon.
