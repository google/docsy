description: "Available development paths and resources for Customer Success Managers at GitLab."
---








As a Customer Success Manager at GitLab, you should feel empowered to take the time to invest in yourself and your career, leaning into the [70-20-10 rule for development](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#70-20-10-rule-for-development).

To be intentional about our commitment to continuous improvement, the first Friday afternoon of every calendar month is strongly encouraged to be protected and used for personal and professional development, either individually or in collaboration with other GitLab team members.

To this end, it is essential to understand what resources are available for your personal and professional development, and the remainder of this page strives to be a place for leadership and CSMs to contribute to the resources available for the progression and development of the CSM team.

## Customer Success Management - Learning and Development Resources

The content is divided into three key categories of competencies.

## How PS Technical Instructors Teach Technical Concepts

These are videos of actual 8-hour courses given live to customers by GitLab's Education Services department. These are good examples of how to present technical concepts in a structured format.

> The Education Services team is working on shorter, edited versions of these class videos. They'll replace these links with the edited versions when they're available. For now just fast-forward through labs and breaks in these unedited class recordings.

Access codes and recording links can be found in this [internal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WNwz_2TbavLgEVG86eENu4Mf_StjYt77h-d-364l3bM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Career development

### Within the CSM job family

- The [CSM Job Family page](/job-families/sales/customer-success-management/) is kept updated with the roles and responsibilities of each level within the CSM job family
- The [CSM Skills Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_UEke64Qkz8wSyqfr_E9qqeAF6rX77w4vIH84Ckm_ts/edit#gid=0) enables a CSM to determine areas of opportunity in working towards their next level of seniority

### Within the CS org

- [The SA Job Family page](/job-families/sales/solutions-architect/) is kept update with the roles, responsibilities and technical expectations of an SA. For CSMs interested in moving into SA roles, they can work with their managers on learning paths to develop the technical and sales skills where needed.

### Within GitLab, outside of CS

- While there is no 'formula' for moving into roles in other teams, we welcome CSM growth and desire to explore alternative areas with GitLab.  For CSMs looking to move into different groups outside of CS, the first step is to review the job family requirements and connect with their manager on determining a path. It is encouraged for managers to connect with the group's team leaders in question to build out a development plan that will have the best chances of success.
