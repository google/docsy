### Surveys Overview

As an all-remote company, there are several surveys we run to better understand the GitLab culture, team member engagement, and overall health of the organization.

Seeking inputs from team members by surveying people is a key part of [GitLab's engagement strategy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1obW5VTKywVyMXRd8no783BfnJJ8wzLVNcsFBC94-rAc/edit?usp=sharing) and helps the People Group to align our priorities to the areas team members care about most.

There are different survey types that we run at different times throughout the year, each with different intended outcomes:

- *Employer Award surveys:* we ask team members to complete employer award surveys (i.e. Great Place to Work) to understand how GitLab compares against our talent competitors and to give future candidates insight into what it would look like to work here. The process for selecting and participating in [employer award surveys]({{< ref "awards-process" >}}) is outlined in the Talent Brand section of the handbook.
- *Engagement survey:* We partner with CultureAmp to host and run our engagement surveys. We ask all team members to complete this survey at least once a year to understand how engagement is tracking over time.
- *Organizational Health survey:* we will sometimes run a survey to understand our company and culture more fully (i.e. McKinsey OHI survey) and classify these efforts as Organizational Health surveys.

## CultureAmp Engagement Survey Overview

Team Member Engagement is important to the continued success of GitLab making the Engagement Survey an important element within the annual `People Group` calendar. Engagement strategies have been shown to reduce attrition; improve productivity and efficiency; further embed the company values and ultimately enhance role satisfaction.

We partner with [CultureAmp](https://www.cultureamp.com/) to run our Engagement Surveys. CultureAmp provides a platform to gather feedback confidentially, benchmark against external comparables, and uses algorithms to highlight which areas matter most to our team members.

Engagement surveys are geared toward giving team members an opportunity to provide feedback in terms of their experience within GitLab touching on pertinent elements such as `Company Culture`, `Teamwork`, `Management` and `Inclusion` among others.

Feedback from the survey in turn allows Leadership within GitLab to gain insight into what is most important to team members, in particular what the business is doing well and what may need future iteration with the intention of improving the underlying team member experience and ensuring healthy levels of attrition are maintained.

### Survey Confidentiality

In an effort to ensure team member confidentiality is upheld, only managers with >5 respondents will be able to view quantitative results - this is carried across to demographic filtering in teams with population sizes which exceed the minimum too. The survey is wholly administered by Culture Amp on a secure external website and the survey data will not be stored on any local computer. If you'd like to know more, check out CultureAmp's [FAQ guide](https://support.cultureamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/204529829-Survey-participant-FAQs).

### Survey Participation

To make sure we hear from as many team members as possible, the People Group will provide Divisional leaders and People Business Partners with access to participation rates at the Divisional level and to managers with 5 or more direct reports.

We will share with individual managers how close they are to recieving enough responses to view a detailed report noting that managers can only see individualized results for their teams if 5 or more of their direct reports complete the survey. We will not report participation statistics for managers with fewer than 5 direct reports.

### Survey Sections and Factors

The GitLab Team Member Engagement Survey is comprised of eleven sections each of which is aligned to a specific area of focus otherwise known as a factor.

The survey factors we primarily focus on:

1. Overall Sentiment and Inclusivity
2. Confidence in GitLab and Management
3. Your Role & Connecting at GitLab
4. Team and Company Values
5. Action
6. Open text questions

Overall survey ranges anywhere from 40 to 50 questions. The format of the survey was predominantly Likert or Rating Scale with a handful of free text questions or comments toward the end. The favorable score is the percentage of participants who selected ‘agree’ and ‘strongly agree’.

## FY'25 Engagement Survey

Our Engagement Survey for FY'25 is scheduled to run from 2024-06-17 to 2024-06-28. Survey will be open to all team members hired before 2024-05-31.

### Summit Pulse Surveys Overview

The goal of the Summit is to build trust through social connections. This trust should lead to higher individual and team motivation, leading to higher productivity and retention. Higher trust between individuals and teams fuels collaboration and leads to stronger results.

To best determine how effective we are at achieving the goal of Summit is to gauge team member perceptions before and after the event.

#### We ran two surveys

- Pre-Summit: January 9, 2024 to January 19, 2024
- Post-Summit: March 15, 2024 to April 5, 2024

This will helped us gain valuable insights into any shifts in sentiments among team members, allowing us to assess the true impact of the summit, satisfaction and engagement.
This is an abbreviated version of our engagement survey, and it also includes a few Summit related questions.

#### Using Epics and Issues to Create an Action Plan

For the FY24 Engagement Survey, all divisions are recommended to create an Epic to store Engagement Survey Action Issues. Every Division should create an Epic that gives an overview of the engagement survey results that includes: highlights, lowlights, recommended actions, and resources. Epic's can be created in division issue boards or projects that are applicable to the organization.

In addition, Managers can create an Engagement Survey Action Issue that links to the division wide epic. In the Issue, managers can link team wide actions to the division.

Once the GitLab Team Member Engagement Survey has been closed out, reports will be dissementated to the E-Group and Divisional Heads for review i.e. only those with team populations >5. These will form the basis of discussion when collaboratively compiling the people strategy for year ahead in conjunction with additional data such as attrition reports etc.

##### Timeline for Action Planning

- Each E-Group member will in collaboration with their respective People Business Partner (PBP) to identify one or two acton items to initiate coming out of the results review - these will be tracked and managed via a dedicated [Epic in GitLab per Division]({{< ref "engagement#using-epics-and-issues-to-create-an-action-plan" >}}).
- After action items have been identified at the E-Group level, all managers who received an engagement survey result report (AKA: managers with 5+ direct reports who responded to the survey) will also be asked to create an action plan in Culture Amp.
- A manager may choose to align their action planning to their leader or division or they may choose to add a specific and separate action for their team. This will likely depend on the size/structure of the organization.

#### Using Epics and Issues to Create an Action Plan

For the FY23 Engagement Survey, all divisions are recommended to create an Epic to store Engagement Survey Action Issues. Every Division should create an Epic that gives an overview of the engagement survey results that includes: highlights, lowlights, recommended actions, and resources. Epic's can be created in division issue boards or projects that are applicable to the organization.

In addition, Managers can create an Engagement Survey Action Issue that links to the division wide epic. In the Issue, managers can link team wide actions to the division.

See the [example epics]({{< ref "engagement#taking-action" >}}) from FY22 for inspiration.

### FY'22 Pulse Engagement Survey

#### How We Determine "Pulse" Survey Questions

In FY'22 Q4 we launched our first "pulse" survey. To determine these questions we leveraged a combination of Culture Amp's "impact" feature + recommended focus areas + key themes related to the [Great Resignation](https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/the-great-resignation-turnover) (according to Culture Amp’s People Scientist teams) to determine which rating questions to include in the pulse survey.

Per CultureAmp’s insights related to the Great Resignation, we added questions related to:

- Focus on “Your Manager” (feedback from Manager, and overall manager performance)
- Inclusion
- The 5 overall Engagement factor questions

Culture Amp determines which questions are "focus recommendations" based on: impact on overall, favorable score, comparison to benchmarks. [Here](https://support.cultureamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001544965-Focus-Agent-Summary) is more information on how Culture Amp determines "focus" recommendations.

"Impact" is a word we use to refer to a statistical technique called a driver analysis. People Intelligence relies on a lot of data and analysis techniques, and one of the most powerful is Driver Analysis. Driver Analysis lets you focus on the most important drivers of outcomes for your culture. The questions that are identified as the top drivers are the questions that are most likely having the biggest impact on Engagement (or whatever measure you have set up as your outcome). So if you were able to improve your scores on these questions, you are likely to improve your Engagement score. You can find more information on how "impact" is determined [here](https://support.cultureamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/208026545-Impact-and-driver-analysis-FAQs).

In addition to leveraging insights from our Engagement Survey tool, Culture Amp, the People Group may add in a couple of additional questions particularly relevant to current business priorities, changes, and/or challenges.

#### FY'22 Pulse Engagement Survey Questions

The FY'22 Pulse Engagement Survey included 19 rating questions and 3 open ended text questions. A complete list of questions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i25j1t55NK48bkT2MJh-05pSOcKKU3QMrU5D4wknS5w/edit#).

##### Timeline for Action Planning

- Each E-Group member will in collaboration with their respective People Business Partner (PBP) to identify one or two acton items to initiate coming out of the results review - these will be tracked and managed within CultureAmp moving forward using the [Action Framework](https://academy.cultureamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005387945-Take-action-with-action-framework).
- After action items have been identified at the E-Group level, all managers who received an engagement survey result report (AKA: managers with 5+ direct reports who responded to the survey) will also be asked to create an action plan in Culture Amp.

Every Division should create an Epic that gives an overview of the engagement survey results that includes: highlights, lowlights, recommended actions, and resources. Epic's can be created in division issue boards or projects that are applicable to the organization.

In addition, Managers can create an Engagement Survey Action Issue that links to the division wide epic. In the Issue, managers can link team wide actions to the division.

<summary>Organizational Health Surveys</summary>

In Q3 FY'23, our Talent & Engagement team ran our first organizational health survey.

GitLab used McKinsey & Company’s [Organizational Health Index "OHI"](https://www.mckinsey.com/solutions/orgsolutions/overview/organizational-health-index) survey to help us understand where we have opportunities to help our organization and team members execute better and increase their impact. The OHI survey is separate from our CultureAmp Engagement survey; learnings from the former will complement the latter and also help inform workplace practices beyond GitLab.

### FY'23 Q3/Q4 McKinsey OHI Survey Results

We’ve summarized high level results of the OHI survey for all GitLab team members in [this document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B-T8TUcuidyIwbcpih01id2-TxZpE6D91Xt6w3z0uIw/edit?usp=sharing).

The document linked above is only available to GitLab team members.
