## “Makes expense submission easy!”
> “Expensify has a really easy user interface for uploading receipts and getting expense reports submitted in a timely manner. I'm also getting reimbursed in quick order as well. The best part is that their internal team checks all receipts against the log and so our CFO doesn't have to get his hands dirty to make sure the receipts line up with what I've submitted.”
### Dean M.
## “Super Easy to Use”
> “It's quick and easy to use as a user, trying to get reimbursed and also very easy as a manager. Looking to approve my direct reports reviews. I particularly like the ability to forward email receipts and have them auto imported into Expensify. Plus the mobile app is really easy to use.”
### Christy H.
## “Expensify helps our company to ensure compliance and accountability”
> “Expensify allows me to easily capture and organize my payment receipts to keep track of my travel expenditures. The user experience is excellent, and the interface is very intuitive not only in the mobile app but also in the desktop. The automated report and approval process really works and my administrative area can easily track my budget vs actual spending, ensuring compliance and accountability in my company. I love the digital receipt capture feature, it saves me time when I come back to the base.”
