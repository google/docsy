<summary>Video transcript</summary>

Hello, I'm Karen Li, the UX Research Manager at GitLab. Thank you for showing interest in working with us.

Our hiring process consists of multiple steps. This helps us best learn about you. And it's a great opportunity for you to learn about us, too.

You can read all about the details of each steps on this page. But there are just a few things I'd like to highlight about the video task, which may be new to some candidates:

1. Firstly, the video task is probably the best (if not only) opportunity to dive really deep into how you approach research challenges, so choose your case study wisely. It could be foundational, strategic, or problem validation that's complex in nature, anything you are proud of.
1. Secondly, the interviewers will also have access to notes from your previous interview steps. This means you can keep the self introduction to under 1 minute, and allow sufficient time to share the details of the research challenge, your thinking process, and your crafts and skills.
1. And finally, make sure to read all sections below, before constructing your video. We have listed a set of topics that we are interested in below. Anything else you'd like to share is welcome, too. Just make sure to keep the length of the video to 20 minutes.

Once again, thank you for showing your interest, and all the best with your job application.

> ### Why we ask for a pre-recorded presentation
>
> 1. It helps create a shared understanding of your work between you and our interviewers ahead of the first team interview.
> 1. It allows us to ask more informed questions about your experience and work during the interview process.
> 1. Generally, we [avoid using meetings as a means to present](/handbook/communication/#common-meeting-problems). Instead, we record presentations, upload to our Unfiltered Youtube channel, and use a meeting as a Q&A. This interview exercise provides you with an opportunity to experience this style of work.
>
> ### Presentation Topics
>
> [This short discussion on our GitLab Unfiltered YouTube playlist](https://youtu.be/VU2BKjGoer4) provides an overview of the topics we'd love to see covered.
>
> 1. A short introduction: who you are, where you're based, your background, and why you're a UX Researcher.
> 1. An overview of one *or* two research studies. We want to understand:
>    - What the research questions are *or* the problems the research aims to address;
>    - Why you chose to present this case study;
>    - The size and the structure of the team (e.g. how many Project Managerss, UX Designers, Developers, UX Researchers);
>    - What your role was, meaning what you personally did or did not do on the project;
>    - How and why you took the approach you did to field the research (and why not other approaches);
>    - How you synthesized the research data to inform product and design decisions;
>    - The final output of your research;
>    - The challenges you faced throughout the project and how you overcame them;
>    - Any high-level findings that you can share while respecting any confidentiality rules in place;
>    - The meaningful business and cultural impact that the research resulted in.
>
> ### What we're looking for
>
> - A recording that is up to 20 minutes in duration and returned to us within ten days of your scenario-based interview being completed.
> - Ideally, one case study you present should be relevant to the work you'd expect do at GitLab. This could be because the case study involved research into the [persona(s)](/handbook/product/personas/#user-personas) you'd study at GitLab, the case study related to the DevOps or Developer tooling industry, the case study relates to the [Stage](/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages) you're interviewing for, is a case study that went across multiple methods, or was a case study that would be considered complex in nature. Note that at GitLab, UX Researchers at any level are working on [problem validation](/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/problem-validation-and-methods/), [foundational](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/foundational-research/) or [strategic](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/strategic-research-at-gitlab/) research projects, while Product Designers conduct solution validation. We'd like to see a case study that is of problem validation, foundational, or strategic nature.
> - You share the recording using either a [unlisted Youtube link](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), a [Google Drive link](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), or a [Loom link](https://www.loom.com/).
> - Your presentation to address each of the topics listed above.
>
> ## Some useful resources
>
> - Unsure on where to get started? Check out our [handbook page on recording a presentation in Zoom](/handbook/tools-and-tips/zoom/#how-to-share-a-presentation-in-zoom). A free Zoom account is all you'd need to complete this presentation.
> - Interested in the type of work our UX team does? Check out our [UX Forum on GitLab Unfiltered](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0Kq89nFXtkVviaIfYQPptwJz), review our [UX Research handbook](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/), and our [UX Department's handbook](/handbook/product/ux/).
> - We work with a [low level of shame](/handbook/values/#low-level-of-shame) at GitLab. In this context, this means we don't expect your presentation to be highly polished.
> - Other questions? Want the Recruiter to review your presentation before the review from the Hiring Manager? Don't hesitate to get in touch with the Recruiter who conducted your screening call.

- We will schedule the next stages if the recording indicates your past experiences will lead to your success in a role at GitLab.

- Candidates will be invited to 2 seperate 50-minute interviews:
  - One with a UX Researcher. Overall, this interview aims to understand how you choose your research methods, how you present results, how you work with a wider team of counterparts, and how you determine whether your research resulted in a meaningful business impact. This interview will also look to understand the softer skills you have as a researcher and how you apply those in the real world.
  - The other with the UX Research Manager where we'll focus on your experience researching Developers and working with global team members in an Agile setting. You will also discuss your career, your experiences as a UX Researcher, and the role of UX Research at GitLab.

- Next up are a couple of 50-minute interviews, one with either a Product Design Manager or Product Designer, and the other with a Product Manager. In these interviews, we'll focus on how you collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders and mentor non-researchers in successfully conducting research. These interviews are opportunities for you to understand the stage you will be a part of in more detail, hear a different perspective on the stable counterpart relationship, and ask any questions you have.

- Successful candidates will subsequently be made an offer via Zoom.

Additional details about our process can be found on our [hiring page](/handbook/hiring/).
