## Contacting the Tax Team

The Tax Team is responsible for GitLab's tax compliance (see here for payroll taxes), tax planning and accounting for business taxes, including income taxes and indirect taxes such as sales taxes and value-added taxes (VAT). Taxation differs between countries, and taxation in one country is not always complementary to taxation in another country, resulting in possible double-taxation on the same GitLab revenue. It is the fundamental goal of the Tax Team to minimize double taxation, to optimize our global effective tax rate, and to timely apply resources to various company needs. Those needs range from routine compliance and tax audits to strategically positioning the company for its next phase of growth.

## Organization

The Tax team is part of the Finance function and headed by the VP Tax. The VP Tax reports to the Chief Financial Officer. The Tax team is structured to address (a) U.S. domestic taxes and global accounting for business taxes and (b) international tax planning and compliance, including US international tax planning.
