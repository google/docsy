# Legitimate Interest Assessment

## 1. Purpose Test

Identify the legitimate interest:

- Purpose of processing

- Business objectives to be achieved

- Benefits of processing

Necessity assessment:

- Why the processing is important to the organization

- Whether there are less intrusive ways to achieve the same outcome

## 2. Necessity Test

Consider whether the processing is necessary by answering:

- Is this processing a reasonable way to achieve the identified purpose?

- Is there a less intrusive way to achieve the same result?

- What would be the impact if the processing could not go ahead?

## 3. Balancing Test

Evaluate the impact on individuals:

- Nature of the personal data - how sensitive or private is it?

- Would people expect this processing to take place?

- What is the possible impact on the individual?

- Are any vulnerable individuals affected?

- What safeguards can be implemented to reduce any negative impact?

## 4. Safeguards and Mitigations

Document measures to ensure fair processing:

- Data minimization steps

- Privacy by design considerations

- Security measures

- Retention periods

- Information provided to individuals
