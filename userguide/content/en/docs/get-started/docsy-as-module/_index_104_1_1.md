## Global People Compliance

The Global People Compliance team safeguards GitLab's most valuable asset—our people—by implementing robust compliance frameworks that protect team member data while enabling our innovative all-remote culture to thrive across global jurisdictions.

We collaborate strategically with the entire People Group, Legal, Payroll, and other organizational teams to develop compliant processes throughout the team member lifecycle—from sourcing and screening to offboarding. Our work ensures GitLab meets both regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations in an increasingly complex global landscape.

We proactively identify, assess, and mitigate compliance risks that could impact GitLab's operations. Our team develops policies that protect GitLab from potential regulatory penalties, and ensures adherence to all applicable employment laws across multiple jurisdictions. Our compliance expertise directly supports GitLab's strategic priorities by:

- Enabling confident expansion into new markets with clear regulatory guidance
- Streamlining compliant hiring processes to secure top talent globally
- Providing decision-making frameworks that balance innovation with compliance
