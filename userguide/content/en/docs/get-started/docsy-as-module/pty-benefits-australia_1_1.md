### Superannuation

GitLab will make superannuation contributions directly to the team member's nominated super fund according to the Australian Government Super Guarantee rate. Effective 2024, the superannuation rate is set at 11.5% of the team member's total salary, with a quarterly cap of $7,483.05 AUD. Super is on top of the salary listed in the compensation calculator/contract.

#### Superannuation payments due dates

Super payment due dates has been a common topic in [#loc_australia](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/CHHFS9DR7). However, there is no reason to worry when payments do not happen monthly as they may be done quarterly.

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) states the following:

> You pay super for eligible employees calculated from the day they start with you. You must make the payments at least four times a year, by the quarterly due dates.

Payments due dates can be found on the [ATO website](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/super-for-employers/paying-super-contributions/when-to-pay-super/).

#### Superannuation Salary Sacrifice

Team members in Australia have the option to make concessional super contributions by sacrificing some of their pre-tax pay and arrange to have it paid into their superfund instead. Effective July 1, 2024 the combined total of GitLab and salary sacrificed contributions [must not be more than $30,000](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Growing-your-super/Super-contributions---too-much-can-mean-extra-tax/?page=2#Concessional_contributions_and_contribution_caps), per financial year.

*Salary Sacrifice FAQ*

- How do I make concessional contributions to my superannuation?
  - Email total-rewards@gitlab.com with the percentage or amount of your salary that you would like to sacrifice.
- Can I change the amount or opt out?
  - Yes, if you wish to change the amount/percentage or opt out, simply send total-rewards@gitlab.com an email.
- Is it possible to start from any month?
  - Yes, it would be processed on the next available payroll.
- Does the payroll provider monitor or stop the concessional cap per year?
  - No, Team Members have no limit on the concessional salary sacrifice. If the contribution goes beyond the annual limit, it will be taxed at a higher rate. The Employer portion, however, stops once it reaches the quarterly cap.

### Life insurance

GitLab does not plan to offer life insurance at this time as Australians can access [government payments and services](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/subjects/payments-people-living-illness-injury-or-disability) if they get ill, injured or have a disability. Most Australians who choose to have life insurance take out cover from their super fund.

### Workers' Compensation

[Fair Work statement](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/workers-compensation)

GitLab renews the Workers' Compensation premium annually for each state. Premium are based on the annual declared wages.

Below are the list of Workers' Compensation regulator for each state:

| State| Regulator |
| ------ | ------ |
|NSW|iCare Worker Insurance|
|QLD|WorkCover|
|NT|WorkCover|
|SA|ReturnToWorkSA|
|TAS|Allianz|
|WA|WorkCover|
|VIC|WorkSafe|

If you need to file a claim, kindly reach out to the Payroll Team or email nonuspayroll@gitlab.com.

### On-Call (Engineering only)

Certain groups in the Engineering division are expected to participate in on-call for business continuity and/or customer support. For more details on the on-call procedure, please reference the [on-call page](/handbook/engineering/on-call/). The purpose of this section is to provide an overview of **time in lieu that will be offered for the Development and Infrastructure departments effective February 1, 2021.** We will continue to review and implement to other departments within Engineering iteratively.

With our global team, we strive for a "follow the sun" model for on-call rotation. This way, team members can participate in on-call during their daytime rather than their nighttime in their respective regions (APAC, EMEA and AMER). In APAC, the majority of the team members are located in Australia. We want to ensure engineers in Australia are 1) eligible for on-call shifts, and 2) stay aligned with local laws to ensure proper rest/recovery time after on-call shifts.

Engineers based in Australia who are part of the Development and Infrastructure departments will be eligible for time in lieu after on-call shifts. Time in lieu is time off from work that is granted to team members to work outside of standard working hours (I.E. ordinary hours).

#### How much time in lieu will I receive for volunteering for on-call shifts?

- 4-hour shift = ½ day time in lieu
- 8-hour shift = 1 day time in lieu
- 24-hour shift = 3 days time in lieu

For weekend shifts please be particularly mindful about managing your time to **ensure you are not exceeding a 38 hour work-week**, and feel free to leverage our [unlimited PTO policy]({{< ref "paid-time-off#paid-time-off" >}}) to complement time in lieu.

*Note: The full shift (state of readiness) is compensated by time in lieu - rather than only the "actual time worked"*

#### What should I do when I want to take more time off after an on-call shift?

If you need additional time to ensure a good work/life balance, on top of the time in lieu, you can leverage our Unlimited [PTO policy as described here]({{< ref "paid-time-off#paid-time-off" >}}).

#### When can time in lieu be taken?

Time in lieu should be taken *within 2 weeks after completion of the on-call shift*. We want to ensure that time in lieu is taken close to the on-call shift to ensure that team members have sufficient time to rest.

#### Do all on-call shifts result in time in lieu?

No, only on-call shifts outside of working hours (I.E. weekends, evenings, etc.). *Please note that not all teams require weekend or evening on-call shifts, so this may not be applicable for all.*

#### How do I request time in lieu?

Time in lieu should be requested via [Time Off by Deel]({{< ref "paid-time-off#time-off-by-deel" >}}) by selecting the `On-Call Time in Lieu` option.

Effective 2024-02-01, GitLab offers Eligible New Zealand Team members a comprehensive medical plan [“Well Being Two”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17WUPQMvvWka77Khe6_adSOiSbibNY3GC/view) via Southern Cross.

GitLab covers 100% of the Team Member costs for the plan. Eligible family members can be added to the plan at a significant discount. Eligible Team Members who wish to add their family members to the plan can arrange ongoing direct debit billing directly with Southern Cross.

The plan offers immediate cover for qualifying pre-existing conditions if you sign up within 90 days of the plans commencement date or team member’s start date (whichever is later).

Please note this benefit is considered a “Fringe Benefit” and will be subject to Fringe Benefit Tax. The benefit is optional and team members are not required to enroll.

GitLab retains the right to replace the provider or policy at any time and is not required to offer this benefit to those that may be ineligible. Any benefits provided under the plan do not impact the Team Member’s or GitLab’s rights to end the employment relationship.

For additional details please refer to the [FAQ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sd2DpIAf7kgl_A5au0VIUYdRuOZ1ZdJx/view?usp=sharing) and [Benefit Summary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17WUPQMvvWka77Khe6_adSOiSbibNY3GC/view?usp=sharing)

## Medical Plan Administration Details

### New Hires

Eligible New Hires will be given a link and code to access the portal and enroll in the plan during their onboarding issue
Total Rewards will also send a monthly report to WTW with new hires as a backup (This process will soon be replaced by automated notifications from Workday)
WTW will have Southern Cross email the eligible new hire with enrollment instructions.

### Leavers

Total rewards will send a monthly report to WTW with leavers (this process will soon be replaced by automated notifications from Workday) - Terminations need to be updated no later than 1 month after the termination date to avoid any overcharging.

### Payroll Reporting

Subsidies for Health insurance are considered a non-cash benefit and are therefore subject to “Fringe Benefit Tax” and must be reported as such.

The Southern Cross portal will generate reports outlining the benefit. The payroll team will have access to the Southern Cross portal to download these reports as needed.

### Invoicing

Southern Cross will load invoices and cover schedules on a monthly basis to the portal. The contact person at GitLab will be notified whenever a new invoice is ready. Payments will be made via bank transfer.

## Annual Leave

Team members are entitled to a minimum of four weeks’ annual leave per year. Annual leave does not expire and can be carried over each year, but GitLab may set expectations on how much annual leave employees may accumulate and may require employees to take entitled leave with 14 days notice. Annual leave runs concurrently with GitLab PTO. Team members must select the `Vacation` option in Time Off by Deel when taking vacation time to ensure that annual leave entitlement is properly tracked.

## On-Call (Engineering-only)

New Zealand employment law requires that work on a formal [Public Holiday](https://www.govt.nz/browse/work/public-holidays-and-work/public-holidays-and-anniversary-dates/), including [on-call](https://www.employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/public-holidays/employees-working-shifts-or-on-call/), is compensated with time-in-lieu. Overtime pay is also required in certain situations, for example: whether the on-call shift fell on a "normal" working day or not, and whether the team member was called to work during their on-call shift. The policy linked above covers for the [time-in-lieu requirement](#on-call-engineering-only) but we do not yet have a set mechanism for handling overtime pay requirements.

New Zealand-based team members *may not be on-call on a New Zealand Public Holiday*, and must seek/find a replacement for any shifts where they may be indicated as being on call on a Public Holiday. To ensure we remain compliant with local laws we team members to consider local laws when volunteering for/accepting shifts.

The process is as follows:

1. When scheduling we should avoid on-call taking/assigning on-call shifts on Public Holidays. A "Public Holiday" will be deemed as any day included in the official holidays on [this website](https://www.govt.nz/browse/work/public-holidays-and-work/public-holidays-and-anniversary-dates/).
1. If a team member is assigned for an on-call shift that falls on a Public Holiday, they need to align with their manager and try to find a replacement for that shift.
If it’s impossible to find a replacement and the team member ends up taking the on-call shift on a Public Holiday, the process to follow is:

- Team member should obtain manager approval for taking the shift.
- If the team member is not called in to work during their on-call shift, a regular time-in-lieu compensation for the shift should be applied.
- If the team member is called in to work during their on call shift, they are responsible for recording their hours worked during the shift and report to payroll/manager in order for overtime payment processing.

*Note: To stay in compliance with local laws we would follow [the New Zealand government website](https://www.employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/public-holidays/employees-working-shifts-or-on-call/) with regards to compensation for worked time during on-call.*

## Statutory Sick Leave

- Team members in New Zealand are entitled to 10 days' of statutory sick leave after six months of current continuous employment with GitLab. For each 12 months after meeting the above criteria, each team member gets at least ten days sick leave.
- If in any year the team member doesn’t meet the criteria, then they don’t get any new sick leave entitlement, but can use their sick leave balance which may have carried over. An employee may re-qualify for sick leave as soon as they meet the criteria.  The maximum amount of sick leave that can be accumulated under the Holidays Act 2003 is 20 days.
- Sick Leave runs concurrently with GitLab's [Sick Time Policy]({{< ref "paid-time-off#sick-time---taking-and-reporting" >}}).

*How to Apply:*

- Team members must contact leaves@gitlab.com when reporting their leave.
  - In accordance with the Holidays Act, GitLab may require a medical certificate
- Designate any time off for illness as `Out Sick` in Time Off by Deel to ensure that sick leave entitlement is properly tracked.
- Unused sick leave will not be paid out to the team member upon termination of employment.

**Injured Leave**

- When the team member is taking leave for the first week of a non-work accident, they can use sick leave and/or annual leave if they have any. This leave runs concurrently with GitLab PTO/Sick Time.

*How to Apply:*

- Team members must notify the Absence Management team (leaves@gitlab.com) as soon as possible when they will need to go out on injured leave.
- Team members must designate time off for injury as `Out Sick` or `Vacation` in Time Off by Deel if they wish to use sick leave or annual leave for the first week of an injury.
- If the leave will last longer than five days and is [covered by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) scheme](https://www.acc.co.nz/im-injured/what-we-cover/), GitLab will top up the ACC payment from 80 to 100% for the first 25 days.

<summary>Garden Leave</summary>

A GitLab team member may use Garden Leave when they have provided their resignation and a Garden Leave is mutually agreed upon by both the team member and GitLab.  Team members can not be forced to take a Garden Leave, but both the team member and GitLab may find it useful in the following situations:

- The team member has access to commercially sensitive information and is going to be working for a competitor at the end of their notice period. Any limit of trade provision would take effect after the employee’s employment ends.
However, employers should be aware that if an employee’s employment agreement contains both a garden leave provision and a restraint of trade provision, the period the employee is on garden leave may be taken into consideration in working out whether or not the restraint of trade provision is reasonable (and therefore enforceable). The restraint of trade provision takes effect after the end of the garden leave period.
- Is distracting other team members while they're in their notice period
- Is being made redundant and the employer is not requiring them to report to work during their notice period so they can look for other job opportunities while they can still say they’re currently employed
- Has been dismissed on notice and their presence is creating an uncomfortable atmosphere for everyone.
- Team members must designate this time off as `Vacation` in Time Off by Deel to ensure that statutory entitlements are properly tracked.

<summary>Leave Without Pay</summary>

Leave without pay is when GitLab allows an team member time off work when they would otherwise be working, but doesn’t pay them for this time. Leave without pay (LWOP) doesn’t end an team member’s employment, and usually the team member returns to their same position and terms and conditions after taking leave without pay (unless the employee and team member agree otherwise). Leave without pay can affect the employee's annual holidays payment and entitlement in some situations.

- Team members must designate this time off as `Out Sick` in Time Off by Deel.

For more information regarding Leave without Pay, please review the [Employment New Zealand's website](https://www.employment.govt.nz/leave-and-holidays/other-types-of-leave/leave-without-pay/).

### Pension

GitLab's KiwiSaver contributions will be 3% on top of base salary. Team members will automatically be enrolled in the KiwiSaver scheme but may elect to opt out within the first 56 days of employment. To opt-out they should follow the [process on IRD site](https://www.ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-individuals/opting-out-of-kiwisaver/opt-out-of-kiwisaver). GitLab will deduct a participating team member's contributions from their before-tax pay at the team member's chosen contribution rate (3%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10%). If a team member does not choose a contribution rate, the default rate of 3% will be used to calculate deductions.

### Life Insurance

GitLab does not plan at this time to offer Life Insurance benefits because New Zealanders can access [government payments and services](https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/providers/health-and-disability-practitioners/health-and-disability-related-benefits.html) to help if they get ill, injured or have a disability.
