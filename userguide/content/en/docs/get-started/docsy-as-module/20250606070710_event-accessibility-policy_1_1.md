Implemented December 2024 | Version 1.1

Green Orbit Digital Ltd is committed to ensuring that all events we organise are fully accessible, inclusive, and welcoming to everyone, regardless of physical, sensory, or cognitive abilities, as well as hidden disabilities. Accessibility is integral to our values and is embedded in every stage of event planning and delivery.

### 1. Guiding Principles

At Green Orbit Digital Ltd, we celebrate “Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combination” (IDIC), recognising that diversity in all forms strengthens our events and enriches our collective experiences.

Accessibility is a foundational principle, not an afterthought. We aim to create events where everyone can fully engage, participate, and contribute without barriers.

## 2. Accessibility in Event Planning

### 2.1 Venue Selection

- Physical Access: All venues will be fully wheelchair accessible, with step-free entrances, wide doorways, accessible seating, and toilets that meet the highest accessibility standards.

- Hidden Disabilities: Venues will provide quiet rooms or low-sensory spaces for individuals who require a calm environment.

- Transport Access: Locations will be selected based on proximity to public transport, availability of accessible parking, and safe drop-off points for mobility aids.

- Signage: Clear, high-contrast, and large-font signage will guide attendees throughout the venue.

### 2.2 Hybrid and Virtual Options

- Online Access: Events will offer virtual participation options through platforms designed for accessibility. Features will include live captioning, screen reader compatibility, and options to adjust visual and auditory settings.

- Inclusive Formats: Materials such as slides, presentations, and documents will be made available in accessible formats (e.g., large print, Braille, or screen-reader-compatible PDFs).

- Follow-Up Access: Post-event recordings, transcripts, and slides will be provided to all participants to ensure those unable to attend live sessions can still benefit from the content.

### 2.3 Programme Design

- Sessions will be scheduled with regular breaks to accommodate individuals with physical or cognitive fatigue.

- Event agendas will include a variety of session types (e.g., interactive workshops, panel discussions, and quiet networking opportunities) to cater to different accessibility needs and learning styles.

## 3. Communication and Registration

### 3.1 Pre-Event Information

- Transparency: Accessibility information will be prominently displayed on event websites and promotional materials. This includes venue details, transport options, available accommodations, and contact information for accessibility enquiries.

- Advance Requests: Registration forms will allow attendees to specify their accessibility needs, including dietary requirements, mobility assistance, sensory considerations, or the need for assistive technologies.

### 3.2 Hidden Disabilities Awareness

- We will provide clear guidance that hidden disabilities (e.g., autism, chronic pain, anxiety, or sensory processing disorders) are equally prioritised.

- Communication materials will reflect inclusivity, offering attendees the option to share specific needs confidentially.

### 3.3 Assistance and Contact Points

- A designated Accessibility Coordinator will serve as the point of contact for all accessibility-related queries before, during, and after the event.
