# Your Individual Growth Plan (IGP) Journey

Your step-by-step resource for creating a meaningful Individual Growth Plan that drives your career forward
## Your Role as the Driver of Your Career
**You are the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) of your career journey.** This means you have the power to make decisions that best serve your growth. This guide offers direction, not rigid rules. At its heart, your Individual Growth Plan is a personal tool to reflect, set goals, and take meaningful action.
After completing your IGP, the real magic happens when you commit to continuous learning:
- ðŸ“… Block dedicated calendar time for your development
- ðŸŒ± Use this time for courses, certifications, stretch assignments, reading, or mentorship
- ðŸ”„ Share your learning journey with your team, especially if youâ€™re a manager
- ðŸš€ Remember, when you prioritize your growth, you inspire others to do the same
## Section 1: What Inspires You?
Self-reflection provides the compass for your career decisions. In this section, youâ€™ll explore these 5 key questions:
1. What parts of your role light you up and keep you engaged?
1. What work gives you that feeling of excitement and belonging?
1. Which areas of your work leave you feeling drained?
1. How do you learn best and most naturally?
1. Looking ahead 2-3 years, what role do you envision for yourself and why?
**Be flexible with yourself here.** You might choose to dive deep using tools like:
- [Myers Briggs assessment](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test)
- [Strengths Finder assessment](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/home.aspx)
- [Learning style exploration](https://edugage.com/what-is-my-learning-style/)
Or you might prefer a simpler check-in approach. Both are perfectly valid!

**Stuck on these questions?** Try this: Keep a simple energy journal for one week. Note when you feel energized or drained throughout your workday, then look for patterns to guide your reflection.
## Section 2: Finding Your Focus
Understanding your desired growth direction helps you set meaningful goals and find the right resources. In this section, youâ€™ll clarify your role trajectory by answering these 3 questions:
1. Do you want to continue growing on your current team or explore something new?
1. Are you interested in managing a team or department someday?
1. Would you prefer developing specialized expertise as an individual contributor?
**Dream big here!** Consider various paths:
- Maybe youâ€™re curious about management
- Perhaps youâ€™re excited to deepen your expertise as an IC leader
- You might be ready for a career transition to a new team
Remember, at GitLab, career growth isnâ€™t limited to climbing a ladder. We grow in all directions!

## Section 3: Setting Your Intention
Now that youâ€™ve explored possibilities, itâ€™s time to get specific in Section 3. Looking toward your future, youâ€™ll articulate your medium-term goals by answering:
1. What specific accomplishments would help you reach your career objectives?
1. How will you recognize when youâ€™ve been successful?
Here are some examples to spark your thinking:

## Creating Your Development Goals
With your intentions set, itâ€™s time to create specific development goals that will help you reach your career objectives. Focus on 1-3 meaningful development goals per review period.
Make your goals concrete by considering:
1. What specific resources or support will help you succeed?
1. How does each goal connect to your broader career aspirations?
1. What actionable steps will you take to achieve each goal?
1. How will you engage your network for support and feedback?
1. What challenges might you face, and how will you address them?
Think creatively about your development using the [70-20-10 rule for development](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#70-20-10-rule-for-development):
- 70% from challenging experiences and assignments
- 20% from relationships, networks, and feedback
- 10% from formal training and education

## Bringing Your Plan to Life: Track, Reflect, and Adapt
Your IGP is a living document designed to evolve with you. Workday will remind you to review and refresh your IGP every 6 months after your manager provides input. Consider setting your own calendar reminders to stay on track.
Remember to [update your development goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qEqTHx_G1uIPQi8rIIbrHjJ6S0NYhKDoHeBOLXsjkNw/edit#heading=h.wje1pky1vhig) directly in Workday as you make progress. Here are ways to keep your IGP alive throughout the year:
1. Choose a format that works for you to track your progress. Check out [these examples](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#tracking-your-progress).
1. Schedule at least one quarterly [career conversation](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#having-career-conversations) with your manager during a 1:1.
1. Review your IGP before completing the [Engagement Survey](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/engagement/#cultureamp-engagement-survey-overview) to provide informed feedback on your career growth.
1. Before participating in the [360 feedback program](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/360-feedback/), review your IGP and ask for specific feedback on your development areas.
1. Include your growth journey and lessons learned in your [Talent Assessments](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/).
