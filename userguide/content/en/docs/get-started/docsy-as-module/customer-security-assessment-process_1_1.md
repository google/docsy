*The above are for GitLab Team Members only. Customers should contact their GitLab [Account Owner](/handbook/sales/#initial-account-owner---based-on-segment) to initiate their requests. If a customer doesn't know their Account Owner or does not yet have an assigned Account Owner, they can [contact the sales team](https://about.gitlab.com/sales/). Once you have submitted the issue, it is now in our queue and will be assigned to one of our Field Security Engineers when it is next up (please see SLA's listed below).*

## Customer Assurance Activity Requests Overview

It's no surprise that GitLab Customers and Prospects conduct Security due diligence activities prior to contracting with GitLab. We recognize the importance of these reviews and have designed this procedure for **GitLab Team Members** to request Customer Assurance Activities.

### **GitLab Team Members**

We will start all CAA requests (with the exception of Contract Reviews) by **sharing the Trust Center with the customer**. The Trust Center will answer many of the customer's questions and will enable us to provide the customer with a more efficient and comprehensive experience.

**Please do not assign the issue. Field Security will assign the issue to the appropriate team member. Thank you!**

### For Questionnaires

The process will be handled in SafeBase. Customers/prospects who have access to the [Trust Center](https://trust.gitlab.com) can directly upload questionnaires by clicking the *Submit a Questionnaire* link at the top of the Trust Center.

Field Security has certain thresholds when determining when, and to what extent, we will complete custom security review questionnaires from customers. Field Security will consider completing questionnaires as detailed [here](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/field_security/questionnaire_thresholds) in the Internal Handbook.

### For Customer Calls and General Requests

Please use the `Customer Call Request` or `General Request` buttons above and follow the instructions.

- Be sure to include all requested information to expedite the process.
- ARR or potential ARR is required
- Customer calls require a preview of the topics the customer would like to cover to ensure we bring in any required subject matter experts for the call.
- If you are unsure of which type it is, please include as much information as you can and our team will adjust as needed.

### For RFP completion

Please follow the directions above for submission, and for more information about our RFP process please view our [RFP page here]({{< ref "Field-Security-RFP" >}}).
