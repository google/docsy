Introduction and Purpose
The purpose of this Charter is to capture
and communicate UKRI’s strategic
values, legislative obligations, policy
direction and guiding principles across
a number of themes which constitute
Responsible Procurement. Importantly
the Charter articulates how both UKRI
and UK government strategy/policy
direction align with, and inform UKRI
procurement strategies within the scope
of Responsible Procurement. The use
of the term ‘Responsible Procurement’
is intended to broaden the scope from
using a term such as Sustainable
Procurement, to align more with a
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
approach, which often is referred to as
including the following three elements:-

1. Ethical Responsibility

1. Environmental Responsibility

1. Economic Responsibility


The use of the word ‘responsible’ demonstrates that UKRI takes seriously
its obligations, its adherence to standards and commitments, acting as a steward across the following six themes:-

1. Environmental Sustainability

1. Health and Safety in Supply Chains

1. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI)

1. Communities

1. Supply Chain Resilience

1. Business Ethics



UKRI’s position as the UK’s steward of research and innovation enables the organisation to be at the forefront of driving changes towards being more responsible in how it manages its people, suppliers and resources employed within its supply chains, for example, noting UKRI’s commitment to Net Zero by 2040.
