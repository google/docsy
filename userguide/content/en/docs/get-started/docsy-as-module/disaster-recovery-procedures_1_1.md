The following outlines a disaster recovery plan (DRP) tailored to the systems mentioned, focusing on key actions and best practices to mitigate risks, recover data, and ensure operational resilience for Green Orbit Digital:

1. Notion (Knowledge Management)

Backup Strategy: Notion automatically saves data to the cloud, but a periodic export of workspace data (pages, databases, etc.) as PDFs or markdown files should be performed. This ensures that critical business documentation is available offline or on other platforms in case of a service disruption.

Recovery Process: If Notion experiences an outage, staff should refer to offline backups or alternative knowledge management tools (e.g., Google Docs or Confluence). Having a version-controlled backup in place ensures quick restoration of essential files.

1. Proton Mail (Email Communication)

Backup Strategy: Set up Proton Mail’s export feature to back up emails and contacts regularly. Exporting mail data to encrypted storage (Proton Drive or an external secure service) helps retain business-critical email conversations.

Recovery Process: In case of an email service failure, Proton Mail’s encrypted archives can be restored to another secure email provider. Ensure users can switch to an alternative email solution (e.g., temporary Gmail accounts) with redirected forwarding to avoid communication disruption.

1. Proton Drive (File Storage and Backup)

Backup Strategy: Proton Drive offers encrypted cloud storage, but critical files should also be stored in an additional backup location. Use external encrypted hard drives or other secure cloud services as an additional layer.

Recovery Process: In the event of file corruption or loss, retrieve files from secondary backups or use Proton Drive's data recovery tools. Ensure that file restoration processes are well documented, especially for critical project data and client materials.

1. WordPress (Website Hosting & Content Management)

Backup Strategy: Utilize a reliable backup plugin (e.g., UpdraftPlus or BackupBuddy) to automate daily backups of the WordPress database and files. Ensure backups are stored in multiple locations (e.g., cloud storage and external servers)
