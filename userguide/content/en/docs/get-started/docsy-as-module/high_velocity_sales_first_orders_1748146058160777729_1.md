## HVS-FO Sales Team Structure

The HVS-FO Sales Team is comprised of these 3 sets of teams:

- SMB Advocate Teams, covering global SMB accounts
- New Logo Team, covering Base prospect accounts and Web Direct Mid-Market and Large inbound First Orders
- SMB Renewals Teams, covering global SMB renewals

## SMB Sales Model

- [FY26 Global Digital SMB Kick-Off deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CWimjCJkcO7mIJJejv75JLCI1XNB6cReciRZab9U6q0/edit#slide=id.g2b17593787a_0_275)

- [FY26 Global Digital SMB Segment Lines](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CWimjCJkcO7mIJJejv75JLCI1XNB6cReciRZab9U6q0/edit#slide=id.g33f2d6040db_0_0)

- Abbreviations
  - SMB: Small and Medium-sized Business
  - cARR: Contracted Annual Recurring Revenue

All members of the Sales, Support, Billing and Deal Desk teams should familiarize themselves with the Global Digital SMB Model.
The model leverages team-level account alignment so SMB customers have a team of SMB Advocates to assist them. Every SMB Advocate on the team is equipped to work with any SMB customer as the sales point of contact.
The threshold for Global Digital SMB Accounts is <$30k cARR, <101 employees, and excludes Japan.

## Account and Opportunity Ownership

Vision: SMB Accounts will not be owned individually, but by the entire team. This is meant to ensure that SMB customers are supported at the right time, in a scalable way. Each SMB Advocate will have a shared responsibility for collaborating in a customer-centric manner to provide a best-in-class experience to each SMB customer.

### Accounts

- All AMER SMB Accounts are owned by the AMER SMB Sales User.
- All APJ SMB Accounts are owned by the APJ SMB Sales User.
- All EMEA SMB Accounts are owned by the EMEA SMB Sales User.
- Note that in SMB only, EMEA & APJ are considered one territory.

### Opportunities

- All AMER SMB Opportunities are owned by the AMER SMB Sales User.
- All APJ SMB Opportunities are owned by the APJ SMB Sales User.
- All EMEA SMB Opportunities are owned by the EMEA SMB Sales User.

**Advocate owned opportunities will routinely be updated by SMB Ops to the SMB Sales User**

### High Value Accounts

Some Global Digital SMB Accounts are considered to be High Value Accounts. These accounts, whilst owned by an SMB Sales User, will be managed in a 1:1 relationship between the SMB Advocate and the customer, via Cases.

You can use the criteria below to help determine whether an SMB account is a High Value Account or not.

- License growth potential
- Department expansion opportunities
- Ultimate upgrade potential
- Advocate wants to build relationship as a top 50 account

For additional information on how to select a High Value Account in Salesforce please reference the [Account Review Doc FY26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18vBLcLAKSsSGrav_QUqjt_3zrgqZOvLDVBADPvewa5U/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.3swk9suvcl1e)

## Engaging with Global Digital SMB Accounts

Since all Global Digital & SMB Accounts are owned by generic SMB Sales Users, SMB Advocates will only engage with customers when specific customer events / scenarios are triggered. Once one of these defined scenarios is triggered, a case will automatically be created. An SMB Advocate will then be assigned to it, and work it through to completion.

For additional information on how our case routing system works please reference the [SMB Traction User Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1njy6nuwr-DddF6QzZnfpk5z_9ZCpA_ftk-fPYB_b8cQ/edit?usp=sharing)

### Why?

- Enables Advocates to focus on those SMB customers that require, or would benefit from, sales assistance.
- Removes low potential customers from view, since these customers will seldom trigger a case.

### How?

Cases are automatically created when;

- A customer requires sales assistance in order to transact.
- There is a high likelihood a customer will churn / contract.
- There is a high likelihood that a customer is considering upgrading or adding additional products.
- If none of the above apply, and the customer is on auto renew, a case will generally NOT be created.

## Case Types

Instructions and resources for working each case type can be found in the content below:

[FY26 HVS Case Workflow Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s9SeHFlXZPBxo64A0gPENSza-kA_5FbmsQE-Y-11Ags/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

## Working with the Global Digital SMB Account Team

If a GitLab team member needs to loop in the Advocate team on a customer Account, they must create a case.  (**Chatter messages sent to the AMER/ APJ/ EMEA Sales Users are not monitored**).

[Case Creation How-to Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cExv6WlzM4RBkOBDJlSWG56o5BsRGnns/view?usp=drive_link)
[FY26 SMB/SDR Handover Process](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18tGE_dpbx7nLu2S6bzD3WkLrHM3IrDv72WWJMgDDi64/edit?gid=920984489#gid=920984489)

- Navigate to the end user *Account* in Salesforce.
- Hover over *Cases*, and select *New Case*.
- Select *SMB Sales Case*, from the Record Type dropdown.
- Add the *Contact*, to the Contact Name lookup field. (A Lead can also be added, instead of a Contact, however in this scenario, the Account the Lead is matched to must also be manually added to the case.  To find the matched account, view the *Traction Complete Leads: Account* field)
- Add the *Opportunity*, to the Opportunity lookup field (if relevant).
- Describe the ask of the AE in the case *Description* box. Include any relevant links or resources. (Once the case has been created, you can also upload files e.g. a PO, in the *Google Docs & Attachments* section at the bottom of the case record).
- Select a *Type* that most closely matches the origin of your request. (e.g if you are in Support, select *Inbound Request*)
- Set the *Priority* to High.
- Complete the *Subject* field, using one of the below options;
  - *Support Ticket* (if you are an SE)
  - *Partner Opp* (if you reside in the Partner org)
  - *Referral* (if you are in Sales)
  - *FO Opp (Startup)* if you reside in the Community relation team, and a free customer is ready to transition to paid.
  - *AR Request* (if you are in AR/ Billing)
  - Note: if you are an SDR creating the case, the *Case Subject* must be either equal *FO Opp*, or *SDR Created* (See *Use Case Specifics* below)
- **SDR must create a case with the Subject: *FO Opp*. *Note*: Please ensure the Account includes a complete Billing Address prior to setting the Record Owner to the AMER/EMEA/APJ Sales User in the Lead conversion screen.**
- This Case will now routed and worked by an SMB Advocate.
- If a case has not been actioned as per the stated SLA, please chatter the regions [ASM](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00OPL000000rpxF2AQ) on the case to escalate.

## Tracking Cases you have created

Once you have created a case, you can easily view its progress by using the report below as a template.

[FY26 - Cases created by Department X](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00OPL000000toc5)

- Click *Customize* on the report.
- Click *Edit* next to the *Created* by filter.
- Enter in your name in the free test box. (You can also add the names of your colleagues who will also be creating cases.  The names must be comma separated).
- Click *OK*
- Click *Save As*
- Choose a relevant name for the report, and save it in your teams folder.

You can now return to this report at any time to check;

- Who the current case owner is. They can be chattered on the case should you have any questions.
- Case Status (This should be either *Open*, *In Progress*, or *Closed*)
- Next Steps (Useful if the case is still set to *In Progress*)

## SMB Advocate Playbook

### Introduction to SMB Cases

- As of 02/01/2025, all cases will be auto-assigned to Advocates using Traction Complete's round-robin functionality.
- Information pertaining to the case will be displayed in the **Context**, **CTA** & **Description** box.
- At any time, an SMB Advocate can view their cases by navigating to the My Cases list view in Salesforce.

#### Case Status

Available Case Statuses:

- Open
- In Progress: Attempting Contact
- In Progress: Blocked
- In Progress: Engaged
- Closed: Duplicate
- Closed: Unresponsive
- Closed: Resolved

- Once a Case is considered closed, the Status should be set to one of the three Closed options above and the Resolution Action updated. This will automatically update the Date/ Time Closed field.
- **Note**:  Inbound customer requests must only be marked as closed once the customers needs have been addressed.

### Case Workflow and Management

- To work the case, the SMB Advocate should contact the customer, with all activities logged on the contact/ account, via Groove. The Next Steps fields on the case should also be updated to include the case next steps/ date.
  - An Advocate must then update the Status to In Progress (this shows the case is being worked).

**Next Steps Field Hygiene Example**:

- Incorrect: Contact
- Correct: 2024-07-05 KK First touch email to discuss promo

- Incorrect: Waiting on billing
- Correct: 2024-07-05 KK Followed up with billing team to approve refund request

- When working cases, the following Groove cadence should be followed.
  - Day 1 - Email
  - Day 3 - Call
  - Day 5 - Email
  - Day 7 - Email

- **Note**: When assigned a case created by a GitLab stakeholder e.g the Support Team, it is crucial that the Advocate updates **Next Steps** as soon as the case has been actioned.
 This allows the stakeholder to view case updates, and negates the need for them to chatter the Case Owner requesting an update.  Any updates that *are* requested via chatter, should be answered by the Advocate/ Case Owner within one business day.
- (If the Advocate is working on an Expansion Opportunity case, any Add On or Growth opp they uncover should be manually created, and linked to the case in question, via the Opportunity lookup field).
- If applicable, the linked opportunity should also be closed.

### Advocate Expectations

- An Advocate should look to resolve/ close a case within 7 days of it being opened. The max time to resolve a case is limited to 15 days (*List of case exceptions below*).
  - High Value Account
  - Renewal Will Fail
  - PO Required
  - First Order (FO)
  - Customer request to get in touch at a later date
- The Advocate must also adhere to the Required 10, to ensure that the correct case fields and opportunity fields are updated when picking up, working, and closing out a case.

## Renewals Team

The SMB Renewals Team will soft launch on May 5th, 2025. Every SMB Renewal opportunity will have a Renewal Manager attached and engaged.

- As the Renewals team ramps to full capacity, they will start to take over cases on accounts that are both < 3k CARR and < 20 LAM
- **Most Renewals case types will be deprecated as soon as the Renewals teams take over renewal engagement.**
  - **Exceptions**:
    - Autorenewal Recently Turned Off
    - Overage with QSR Off
    - Autorenewal Will Fail
- Renewal Managers can escalate cases to Advocates by adding #advocate to the Subject of any case assigned to them
- These cases will be assigned as per usual SMB Advocate routing rules. Advocates can reach out to the RM for additional context.
- Renewals Managers **will be assigned to HVA renewals**, the expectation is for Advocates and RMs to work as a team to build these relationships
- As a reminder, please review recent Activities on your HVA accounts once RMs are engaged as that is where you will find their activities. They will also have access to and review your Account Plans.

## New Logo Team Playbook

**Key Audience**: New Logo Account Executive, Area Sales Managers, and Renewals Managers

### Introduction to New Logo Team

**Overview**

The New Logo Team is a specialized sales team within GitLab's High Velocity Sales & New Logo organization focused on closing first-order deals in MM & ENT accounts. 

**Team Structure**

- **Team Members**: 4 New Logo AEs, 4 BDRs, and 1 ASM
- **Launch Date**: May 1, 2025

**Team Mission**

- We are the painters of GitLab's unified DevSecOps vision, guiding prospects on transformative journeys to accelerate business results and  the value they deliver to their customers.
- We are the architects of GitLab's future growth, planting the seeds today that will flourish for decades to come. Every new logo we secure today becomes tomorrow's expansion opportunity and advocacy story.

**Team Vision**

- Gold Standard. We will build a New Logo flywheel that other teams and companies will study and attempt to replicate
- Talent Engine. We will have a legendary sales team that will be known for unmatched sales skill, a team that delivers insane amount of Logos, all while having fun and innovating.
- Value Accelerators. We are trusted partners who create transformative outcomes for our customers.
- Culture Champions. We are a showcase of GitLab’s culture. Interacting with us is flexible, asynchronous enabled, and transparent.

**Team Values**

- Relentless Prospecting. We are Pipeline Builders; no silver spoons. Prospecting happens every day, picking up the phone happens every day; no exceptions.
- Work Hard, Work smart. We leverage tools to get better. We are AI-powered. We make data-driven decisions.
- Hone our Craft. We are continuous learners - every day, we get 1% better. Be curious.
- Technical Command. We build deep understanding of our platform, speak DevSecOps fluently and bring value to technical buyers; we don't sell.
- Builder Mentality. Motion Architects, not quota chasers. We're building the playbook others will follow.
- Better Together. We overshare, your breakthrough belongs to the team. Isolation is the enemy of innovation. One team, one pipeline, one mission, one collective team intelligence.

### New Logo Sales Process

#### Account Strategy

We use a tiered approach to focus efforts efficiently:

- **Tier 1**: High-priority accounts receiving most attention from BDRs and AEs, including collaborative prospecting
- **Tier 2**: Accounts receiving scaled outreach programs and targeted campaigns based on buying intent signals
- **Tier 3**: Accounts primarily receiving digital marketing and PLG motions rather than dedicated sales resources

#### New Logo AE Time Allocation

Recommended Time Split: 

- **40% Prospecting**: Account strategy & planning and direct outreach
- **30% Deal Advancement**: Moving opportunities through pipeline
- **20% Admin/Operations**: CRM updates, forecasting, internal meetings
- **10% Feedback/Improvement**: Process iteration and sharing learnings

A typical week should look like:

**Monday**: Strategy & Account Planning

- Team stand-up and weekly planning (30 min)
- Account planning and targeting strategy (2 hours)
- BDR collaboration sessions (2 hours)
- "Inbound Interest Feed" dashboard review (1.5 hours)

**Tuesday & Wednesday**: Prospecting & Deal Advancement

- Dedicated prospecting blocks (2.5 hours)
- Discovery and qualification calls (2 hours)
- Opportunity advancement (1.5 hours)

**Thursday**: Deal Advancement & Process Improvement

- SA engagement and technical validation calls (2.5 hours)
- Deal negotiation and proposal writing (1.5 hours)
- Team feedback session (1 hour)

**Friday**: Administrative & Closing

- Final push on deals closing this week (1.5 hours)
- CRM updates and opportunity management (1 hour)
- Internal meetings and enablement (1 hour)
- 1:1 with manager (1 hour)
- Weekly metrics review and forecast update (1 hour)

#### Success Metrics

**Primary Metric (North Star)**

- FO Count

**Secondary Metrics**

- Calls / touches (including LinkedIn and emails)
- Multi-threaded accounts (accounts where you're in touch with multiple people)
- Meetings
- Pipeline generation
- nARR
- Close Rate
- Average deal size and cycle time

#### Feedback Mechanisms

We actively seek and act on feedback across multiple channels:

**How We Capture Feedback**

- **In Meetings/Slack**: Weekly meetings and Slack channels for real-time feedback (focus on "1 thing we need to do differently to win")
- **Passively**: Gong reporting with weekly/monthly review cycles
- **Active-ish**: Feedback Friday form with specific questions
- **Actively**: Mechanisms to collect feedback during the sales cycle

**Feedback Prioritization**

- **High Priority**: Critical issues requiring immediate action
- **Medium Priority**: Selected items (3 per quarter) for potential development
- **Low Priority**: Ideas requiring additional data

#### Team Cadence

- **Weekly**: New Logo Team Meeting, 1:1 with Manager, 1:1 with BDR
- **Monthly**: HVS Team All Hands, Feedback/team learning sessions
- **As needed**: Additional collaboration sessions

### Cross-Team Collaboration

#### BDR Collaboration

Each New Logo AE pairs 1:1 with a BDR handling both inbound and outbound motions. New Logo AE and BDR pairs will jointly target accounts and different personas with the account.

**Account Selection**

- Regular joint meetings to select target accounts
- Focus on Tier 1 accounts
- AEs can nominate accounts for BDRs to move into their "actively working account" list

**Role Specialization**

- BDRs typically focus on lower-level personas; AEs on higher-level contacts
- BDRs may cc AEs on executive outreach for credibility
- BDRs handle all MQLs until they become SAOs
- BDRs will target 4 new accounts per day (20 per week) with a 3 week prospecting cycle per account

**Meeting Collaboration**

- Inbound leads: BDRs qualify and may participate in the second discovery call with AEs
- Outbound efforts: BDRs and AEs can "tag-team" the first call with prospects

**BDR Success Metrics**

- **Primary**: 8 SAOs per month (target for fully ramped BDR). However, BDRs have a stretch goal to hit 10 SAOs per month with accelerators.

#### SA Collaboration

A First Order SME SA is aligned to this team to provide technical support during the sales process.

**When to Engage SAs**

- When prospects are demo-ready: for customers wanting to understand GitLab's value and how it solves their business needs
- During Stage 3 for opportunities where a [Command Plan](/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/command-plan/) and [MEDDPPICC documentation](/handbook/sales/meddppicc/) are being leveraged
- During technical evaluations: aim to have SAs involved at least 15 days of the Close Date and at least 1 day (ideally more) when direct engagement is needed

**SA Engagement Process**

- AE completes Command Plan and MEDDPPICC documentation
- AE submits SA request via SFDC with required information
- Request reviewed and assigned within one business day
- SA and AE align on strategy
- SA prepares customized materials
- SA supports technical aspects
- SA documents outcomes and next steps
- SA remains available for ongoing support

#### Partner Collaboration

Our team will work with relevant GitLab partners to expand our reach and provide additional service capabilities to customers.

**Partner Motions**

- With Rank 1 and Rank 2 accounts, partners will provide services and act as technical support especially if we have SA-capacity constraints. **Examples**:
  - Demos, VPs, and POCs
  - Co-selling with AWS
- For Unranked accounts, partners that also have contacts in our accounts will take the lead on the account as the primary sales contact

## Required 10

The Required 10 acts a to do list which should be followed by all Advocates when picking up and working cases.

[FY26: SMB Required 10](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yhRsbS0K9s1Un9puBFF51nE0oT040558QQfad2yL_4c/edit#gid=0)

### Picking Up

Case: Status

- Should be set to In Progress, (then Closed - Resolved/ Duplicate/ Unresponsive once worked).
- "Waiting" statuses can be used to indicate a dependency on a business partner team.

Case: Owner

- Should always be set to the Advocate working the case.  Cases can be moved in rare circumstances i.e the end user wishes to converse in a language that you do not speak, but another Advocate does.

Case: Contact

- Advocate to add/update the main contact, as the case is being worked. If a lead exists on the case, it must be converted to a Contact before the case is closed out.
- A case cannot be set to Closed Resolved unless a Contact is attached to the case.

### Managing

Case: Next Steps & Date

- To act in the same fashion as Opp: Next Steps. Field is mandatory.
- Format must be; Date, Advocate Initials, What the Next Step is
- - 2024-07-12 MS Send quote to customer

Account: GitLab Admin added

- Only for cases related to an opportunity
- Must be added in order to move opp to closed won.

Related Opportunity

- If the case involves an open opportunity, it should be linked to case in this field.

Opp: Close Date

- Only for cases related to an opportunity
- To help with forecasting.  Must not be in the past.

Opp: Renewal Risk Category

- Only for cases related to an opportunity
- To help with forecasting
- **If an opportunity is marked as guaranteed churn, please remember to set the stage to Closed Lost**

Contact/ Account: Activity

- Must be logged via Groove on the Contact

### Closing

Case: Resolution Action

- Mandatory when closing out a case.

Opp: Status

- Only for cases related to an opportunity

- To mimic the case i.e if the case is closed, the opp should be closed won or lost

Case: Feedback

- A place where an Advocate can share feedback pertaining to the case itself, or the customers use case.  This is mandatory.  If there is no Feedback to share, NA should be entered in this field. Next Steps and general comments should not be listed in this field - feedback only.
- - e.g Customer Feedback : “thank you for helping me resolve my problem very quickly”

## Case Closure Criteria

Closed - Resolved

- The Advocate was able to address the customers' concern/ transact the renewal, and no further action is needed.  A case cannot be marked as Closed - Resolved if the Next Steps Date is in the future, and/ or the Contact field on the case is blank.

Closed - Duplicate

- An Advocate has already addressed the customer's concern via a similar case.

Closed - Unresponsive

- After 15 days of trying to contact the end user, no response have been received.

## Use Case Specifics

### Email to Case

SMB customers are able to email smallbusiness@ in order to speak to an Advocate.

When they do so, an SMB Case will automatically be created and will be routed to an Advocate in AMER/EMEA/APJ.

The subject of the email will be displayed in the **Case Subject** field, and the email body will appear in the **Case Description** field.

**FAQ**

Q. As an Advocate, if I am assigned a case, but there is no contact/ account/ lead attached to the case - how do I know if the case falls into my region?

A. If a customer emails smallbusiness@ and they do not exist in Salesforce as a contact, the contact and account fields will not be populated on the case.  When this happens, we have no way of knowing which region the customer resides in.

Traction will attempt to match the person to a Contact or Lead using the Web Email field. If that fails, SMB Ops will be notified to determine where the case should be routed.

Q. If a case is routed to me, but the customer continues to email smallbusiness@, how will I know?

A.  Once you have been assigned a case, any future emails from the customer in the same thread will trigger a notification to be sent to the case owner.  All emails in the thread are also attached to the case.

Q. If a customer has a new request, but they send an email to smallbusiness@ via an old thread, will a new case be created?

A. No.  Unfortunately, the email will be attached to the prior case which is likley to have been closed.  In this scenario, the owner of the prior closed case (who will receive a notification of the customers email), should either ask the customer to initiate a new request (by sending a new email to smallbusiness@.  This will create a new case, and start a new thread. Or, the Advocate can create a new case on the customers behalf, and work that case.

### High Value Account Cases

Whilst Accounts are always owned by the regions SMB Sales User, High Value Account Cases attached to accounts are owned by the SMB Advocate.

These cases are to remain open for the entirety of the FY26, even if the customer renews. This means that if a HVA customer renews mid way during FY26, they will be assisted by the same Advocate both pre and post renewal.

These cases act as a reminder that these customers require continual attention and should be worked strategically during the financial year.

The Advocate is advised to build relationships with these customers, understand their journey with GitLab, and identify what we can do to grow the account (Ultimate or Add On licenses) or promote adoption and churn prevention.

The Advocate is advised to schedule ongoing touchpoints, update Next Steps/ Next Steps Date, and create future dated reminder Tasks, so that they plan their outreach throughout the year.

Note that these Accounts will still trigger other cases types, which should be worked and closed out within the 15 day period.  Any opp created off the back of these cases i.e If a High Value Check In Case results in an Add On Opp, the opp should be linked to the originating case.  Once the opp is closed, the case should be closed. Reminder: The High Value Account case should never be closed.

Note: A High Value Account can be closed out if the customer advises ahead of renewal that they definitely fully churn.  Only in this scenario should the case be closed out, and the *Resolution Action* must be set to *Request Not Possible*.  By setting the *Resolution Action* to *Request Not Possible*, future High Value Cases will not be created on the account.

For more information about managing HVA cases over the year, please review this [FY26 SMB Account Planning slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zS6nkAUBMg_zpJjRM_dEfdc5uBTjt6RkdoQalndPZ-o/edit#slide=id.g341dcdaeb6b_1_0)

### FO Opp (an SDR engages with a net new lead who has been qualified)

Before picking up the case, the Advocate checks that they can attend the meeting (IQM) that appears as an Activity on the Contact record, and in the Next Steps fields. The SDR will be able to see that the case has routed to the Advocate assigned in the IQM.

The below SDR Handover Process steps, and Handover Criteria, detailed below should also be followed by both the SDR and Advocate.

*Note*: If Prospect is ready to buy (i.e no IQM is required), does not qualify for Advocate support, and is unable to purchase their license via Web (Ex: Multi-Year, Needs PO, Duo Pro, etc), please proceed with the [Blocked Purchase Workflow](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18tGE_dpbx7nLu2S6bzD3WkLrHM3IrDv72WWJMgDDi64/edit#gid=920984489). Criteria [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18tGE_dpbx7nLu2S6bzD3WkLrHM3IrDv72WWJMgDDi64/edit#gid=1849175247).

### SDR Created (an SDR engages with a lead that is related to a customer account)

Before creating a case, the SDR should convert the lead to a contact, under the customer account.
When creating the case, this newly created Contact should be added to the Case.
The below SDR Handover Process steps, and Handover Criteria, detailed below should also be followed by both the SDR and Advocate.

[SDR Created Case Example](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/500PL000005Qb2gYAC)

The above examples can be used as templates for when an SDR creates a case.

### Support Cases

When an Advocate picks up a support case, and the case contains a link to a Zendesk ticket, they must comment in the Zendesk ticket advising that they have picked up the case, and will be reaching out to the customer.

### Customer MQL Cases

Whilst working the case, the lead on the case should either be;

- Converted to a contact under the linked account, if the lead confirms they work at the linked account/ company, AND there is an nARR opportunity.
- Not converted/ disqualified if the lead does not work at the linked account/ company, OR there is no nARR opportunity.

### Expansion Opportunities

If an opportunity is uncovered whilst working an Expansion Opportunity case, a new Growth/ Add On opp should be created, and linked to the case via the Opportunity lookup field. An Add On opp must be created from the prior closed won renewal opp that exists on the account.
If the customer is looking to upgrade to Ultimate/ add users at the time of renewal, the existing Renewal opp should be linked to the case.  The renewal opp should also be used for any new quotes that are generated.

## Case Hygiene

### Case SLA

All cases should be picked up and reviewed within 24 hours of being routed and assigned.

### Open Case Guidelines

All cases should be worked, and closed out, within a 15 day period (except High Value Account cases).

The above, and other data points, will be tracked on the below dash.  Periodically, the info will be presented to the Advocate so that they can 'clean up their room'.

Due to the high case volume, it is imperative that the Required 10 is followed, so cases do not become stale.

## FAQ

- Q. Will cases be assigned to me everyday?
- A. Yes, we expect new cases to be created daily, and to total approximately 400 per month.
- Q. Can I pick up any Case in the queue?
- A. No, cases will now be routed via Traction and the queue is no longer used. Any case considered a High Value Account will be routed to the corresponding Advocate.
- Q. How many cases should I work at any give time?
- A. An Advocate should only own 50 In Progress cases at a time.  Once at 50, the Advocate is deemed to be at capacity.
- Q. Where can I provide feedback on this model/ process?
- A. Please submit all feedback via the *#hvs slack channel*.  If you want to share Feedback relating to a specific case, please enter the feedback in the Case: Feedback field.
- Q. Is additional enablement material available?
- A. Yes, please see the *Dashboards, Reports & Enablement Docs* section of this page.
- Q. As a GitLab Team Member who is not part of the SMB Team, how do I engage with the team?
- A. Follow the process above entitled *Working with the Global Digital SMB Account Team*.
- Q.  What happens if the end user speaks a different language than I do?
- A. Discuss with your manager who might be best placed in the team to handle this case, then switch the Case Owner to that individual. Also add the tag #languagebarrier to the Feedback field on the case.  This will allow the SMB Team to track how often language becomes an issue.
- Q. As an Advocate, if I am assigned a FO Opp case, and discover the customer is actually a MM account, what do I do?
- A. Follow the below steps;
  - If the FO Opp is still in Stage 0, advise the SDR via Chatter that they should loop in the MM AE.
  - Mark the case as Closed - Duplicate
  - If the IQM has taken place, and you have moved the opp to Stage 1, loop in the relevant MM AE on the opp, via Chatter.
  - Closed the case as Closed - Duplicate.
- Q. There is no opportunity linked to the case, but I have identified a Growth/ Add On opportunity, what do I do?
- A. If you discover a Growth opportunity, you should manually create a Growth/ Add On opp and link it to the case via the Opportunity field. If an opp is already attached to the case (Renewal or QSR opp), this opp should be updated to reflect the possible growth.
- Q. If I am working a case, and the customer advises they are looking to expand but not for 6 months, should I close out the case?
- A. No, update the Next Steps stating that the customer is open to a conversation in 6 months.  Also, change the Next Steps Date to 6 months from todays date, and update the stage of the case to Open.  *Please remember to leave the open case in your name.*
- Q. I am an AE not in the SMB Org, and a former customer has reached out to me.  This customer is now owned by an SMB Sales User.  How do I hand this customer over to the SMB Sales Team?
- A. Follow this [process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bc9N0Cvc65NjWHSVoliUp6injZNlbkjEEEZ0dYQm_Ck/edit#heading=h.wmdr1tkj670j).
- Q. I just closed won on opp for a SMB Customer, which took them above the $30k CARR threshold.  How do I hand this over to MM?
- A. See this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dIJwPRo3rQnE1e4LBG-lT4ZvJ3nXzMuKwP8mF54jACo/edit). Note that accounts will be moved to MM at the start of the next quarter.
- Q. When I am working a case, and the customer is interested in speaking in 6 months, do I keep the case open, or close it out?
- A. In this scenario, the case should remain open and left in your name.  To do this;
  - Update the Next Steps on the case, as per your conversation with the customer.
  - Set to Next Steps Date to 6 months from today.
  - Set the Case Status to Open
- Q. If a prospect/ customer emails me directly requesting assistance, what do I do?
- A. First check the account to see if there is an In Progress SMB Sales Case owned by a different Advocate.  If there is, add the nature of the customers request to the Description field, and chatter the Advocate on the case. If no case is present, and this enquiry represents a nARR opportunity, follow the above process (*Working with the Global Digital SMB Account Team*.), and assign the case directly to yourself. Note: for general enquiries, you should direct customers to smallbusiness@gitlab.com
- Q. As an Advocate, when I go on PTO, what happens to my cases?
- A. Whilst on PTO, your *In Progress* cases will remain in your name. In your OOO email signature however, you should include the contact details of a fellow Advocate who has agreed to cover you whilst you are away. Ideally, this Advocate should be located in a similar region with similar langauge skills. When a customer emails you (and the Advocate providing coverage), the Advocate providing coverage should assign the active case to themself, and work it through to completion.  Also, be sure to follow the standard PTO guideline stated [here](/handbook/people-group/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off).
