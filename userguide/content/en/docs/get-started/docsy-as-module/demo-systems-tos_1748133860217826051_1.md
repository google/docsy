## Welcome to Our Demo Ecosystem

Our demo systems are valuable resources designed to help all internal team members throughout the sales cycle. See a full list of our supported systems [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/solutions-architecture/coe/demo-architecture/da-infra-navigation-project/-/blob/main/README.md). We want you to make the most of these tools and encourage you to reach out for support whenever needed.

## Important Boundaries

- **Internal use focus**: These instances are not intended as platforms to freely provide access and licenses to friends, family, or external parties who are not customers.
- **Customer account restrictions**: Outside of Learn Labs, customers should not be provisioned accounts on these instances due to potential exposure to red data.
- **Exception process**: We understand that special circumstances may arise with customers. In such cases, please contact the Demo Architecture Team first for approval.

## Compliance

Team members who don't adhere to these guidelines may temporarily lose access to demo instances until the matter is resolved with manager approval.

## What We Encourage

- **Full utilization of all demo tools**: These systems exist to be used! Don't hesitate to explore their capabilities.
- **Learning through experience**: Accidents happen! If you accidentally take down an instance or make an admin mistake while learning, that's completely fine when done in good faith.
- **Not worrying about overuse**: The platforms are built to handle your needs. There's no need to worry about using too many minutes or resources - that's exactly what they're there for.
- **Asking questions**: Our team is here to help. Reach out with any questions or for support when needed.

## Support Contact

For questions, exception requests, or support, please reach out to the COE Demo Architecture Team in the internal #demo-architect-partners Slack channel.
