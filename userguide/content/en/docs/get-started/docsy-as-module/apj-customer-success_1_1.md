The APJ CS team currently does not follow a strict territory alignment. The only exception is that customers in the home base location would have a preference for Customer Success team members to ensure GitLab adoption. The APJ Customer Success team supports the [Large](/handbook/sales/territories/) and [Mid-Market](/handbook/sales/territories/) APJ outlines territories.

## Engagement options with the APJ Customer Success team

Any customer, customer prospect, GitLab Business Partner and/or GitLab Sales representative requiring assistance with GitLab's technology should be directed to the Customer Experience Manager (CEM).

Options to engage with the Customer Experience Manager are:

- Phone call
- Slack message
- GitLab Email
- GitLab Issue
- and other accessible GitLab communication tool

In exchange, all APJ Customer Success team members will document, capture and share (internally) all customer relevant information. We refer to the overview as the APJ Team Board - given the customer sensitivity and Customer Data sovereignty across different APJ regions and countries, this APJ Team Board is available only to GitLab team members.

The main focus is to efficiently centralise customer related information in one location utilising GitLab Kanban boards and document our work in GitLab Issues. We also share it internally across the APJ CS team as well as utilise the APJ Team Board as a follow up tool to ensure our customers success.

The CS team has also been building out a web-application to visualise the information captured by the APJ Team Board. The current goal is to complete that internal project referred as "SA Insights" by the end of FY21-Q2.
