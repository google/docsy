### What's New in GitLab 🚀

The GitLab 12.10 release just went live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:

- Reduce Security and Compliance Risk: GitLab 12.10 included the first MVC of Requirements Management, the first step towards full-blown requirements management with traceability from requirements all the way through to code. We also delivered key compliance features such as Compliance Framework Labels for projects, HIPAA audit project template, and improvements to the compliance dashboard — all of which help customers deliver faster, more efficiently, without sacrificing compliance.
- Increase Operational Efficiencies: Companies can more easily manage multiple projects by tracking and sharing the health status of issues, and they can spend less time switching between tools and more time focused on building great software by leveraging our Jira issue importer.
- Deliver Better Products Faster: Organizations can use GitLab's autoscaling ability on AWS Fargate to auto-scale runners, accelerating delivery and allowing pipelines to efficiently scale to meet demand.

[Visit the 12.10 Release Post for more details](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released/)
