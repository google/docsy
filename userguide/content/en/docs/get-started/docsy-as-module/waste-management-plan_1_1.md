# 1. Introduction 

The purpose of this Waste Management Plan is to describe the principles, procedures, and ongoing commitments Green Orbit Digital has adopted to manage and reduce waste generated from daily business operations. The Plan ensures waste is minimised, reused, and recycled in alignment with Green Orbit Digital’s sustainability objectives and ISO 14001 certification.

This Plan supports an ecological-based management approach, underpinned by adaptive management principles, and integrates sustainability across business functions.

Waste at Green Orbit Digital arises primarily from:

The procurement and use of electronic equipment and office supplies;

Print and promotional material production;

General administrative activities;

Office-based operations and remote workstations;

Event and exhibition participation.

This Plan also considers wider aspects of waste including digital sustainability (e.g. carbon emissions from websites), financial and environmental impacts of waste disposal, education of staff and partners, and performance monitoring.

# 2. Waste Types

Equipment procurement procedure 

Equipment policy 



Green Orbit Digital is committed to low-impact, digital-first operations as part of our broader sustainability framework. As a signatory of the Race to Zero campaign, member of the SME Climate Hub, and in alignment with the Net Zero Carbon Events Initiative, we apply a prevent–reduce–reuse–recycle–restore hierarchy to all waste streams, including digital and physical outputs.

While our physical footprint is minimal, we take responsibility for the full life-cycle impact of the materials, technologies, and platforms we use. All procurement is guided by our Environmental Purchasing Policy (EPP), which prioritises suppliers, services, and materials that meet strict environmental and ethical standards.

## 2.1 General Office Waste

Although we operate remotely, some incidental waste may still occur:

- Printing or postal correspondence for compliance.

- Food waste and packaging from coworking spaces, team meetups, or events.

Waste Reduction Measures:

- Prioritisation of plant-based, compostable packaging at events and internal meetings.

- Use of Too Good To Go, Olio, and similar platforms to redistribute surplus food.

- Coworking or venue partners must demonstrate zero-waste operations and access to recycling streams.

- Team members encouraged to follow a reuse-first approach for containers, stationery, and office supplies.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 2.2 E-Waste (Electronic Waste)

E-waste is a key impact area for digital agencies. It includes:

- Obsolete or broken laptops, monitors, phones, chargers, peripherals, and batteries.

E-Waste Best Practices:

- Tech is sourced from suppliers that meet circular economy principles and offer end-of-life recovery (e.g. Framework, Fairphone).

- Prioritisation of modular, repairable technology to extend product life.

- Devices reused internally, donated to digital inclusion projects, or recycled via certified schemes (e.g. Currys, local authorities, or Restart Project).

- Data wiped following GDPR and UK ICO guidance before reuse or donation.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 2.3 Printed Materials

Printing is extremely limited but may occur for:

- Legal documentation (upon request).

- Accessibility adaptations.

- Client or partner expectations.

Sustainable Print Policy:

- All print is on FSC-certified, 100% recycled paper, using vegetable-based inks when possible.

- Default settings include double-sided, greyscale output.

- Wherever possible, we replace print with:

Printed materials are recyclable and managed as part of our residual waste audit.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 2.4 Digital-Only Invoicing & Documentation

To reduce paper and postal waste while improving traceability:

- All invoices, remittances, and contracts are issued digitally via HubSpot CRM, Xero, and Stripe.

- E-signatures are the default, using platforms such as:

- Compliance with UK eIDAS regulation ensures legal validity.

- All documents are stored securely and sustainably in the cloud, using:

## 2.5 Digital Waste (Data and Energy Efficiency)

Digital waste contributes indirectly to scope 2 and scope 3 emissions. We manage this through:

Green Digital Practices:

- Hosting with Krystal Green Hosting, powered by 100% renewable energy and verified by The Green Web Foundation.

- Use of Website Carbon Calculator to assess and reduce website emissions.

- Routine data decluttering:

- Campaigns built using lightweight formats:

- Email and productivity tools run via Proton, offering security with low-carbon credentials.

These actions align with our SME Climate Hub commitment to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero before 2050.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 2.6 Event & Promotional Waste

Events and pop-ups risk generating unnecessary waste. As a supporter of the Net Zero Carbon Events Initiative, we follow a strict digital-first, zero-waste events policy.

Sustainable Events Protocol:

- No printed tickets, flyers, or handouts: all booking and access handled via Ticket Tailor, QR codes, or email links.

- Branded materials are used sparingly and must be:

- All event content is shared via digital links, hosted on Notion, Google Drive, or embedded on our website.

- Merchandise is only offered if:

Carbon emissions from events are calculated, reported, and offset through our Ecologi programme.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 2.7 Residual Waste

Unavoidable waste (e.g. mixed packaging, contaminated materials) is classified as residual.

Management & Monitoring:

- Quarterly audits conducted to track volumes and identify elimination opportunities.

- Disposal via licensed waste providers only.

- Ongoing review of suppliers and practices to reduce unnecessary packaging or single-use materials.

- Residual waste is transparently reported as part of our Race to Zero progress disclosures.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

## 2.8 Environmental Purchasing Policy (EPP)

All purchases, whether digital or physical, follow our Environmental Purchasing Policy, which includes:

- Prioritising UK-based or local suppliers to reduce transport emissions.

- Selecting vendors with ISO 14001, FSC, B Corp, or SME Climate Hub membership.

- Ensuring all purchased goods and services:

This policy is regularly reviewed to reflect the latest sustainability criteria and supplier performance.

# 3. Waste Collection and Disposal

At Green Orbit Digital, all waste types are collected, stored, and disposed of in accordance with UK environmental regulations, waste hierarchy principles, and our own sustainability commitments under the Race to Zero, SME Climate Hub, and Net Zero Carbon Events initiatives. We aim to eliminate avoidable waste, maximise resource recovery, and prevent pollution throughout our operations.
