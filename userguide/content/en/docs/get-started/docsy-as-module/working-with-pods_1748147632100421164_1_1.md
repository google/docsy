## What is Support Pods?

Support Pods is a flexible framework which any group of team members can use to
set up self-organizing interest-based groups to work on any set of problems they
wish to take on.

The full Support Pods handbook and a list of active Support Pods can be found in
the [Support Pods handbook page](/handbook/support/support-pods).

## How do I get involved?

You can follow the [instructions here](/handbook/support/support-pods#starting-a-support-pod) to
start or join a Support Pod.

## Integrating Support Pods in day to day work

Support Pods are currently not integrated into our ticket handling workflows.
This is intended to allow each Support Pod to determine their own approach to
working with tickets and customer issues.

In general, each Support Pod's approach to work should keep to the
[Key Principles](/handbook/support/workflows/working-on-tickets#key-principles)
and [Priorities & Impact](/handbook/support/workflows/working-on-tickets#priorities-and-impact)
guidelines for working on tickets, and contribute to the team's achievement of
positive customer outcomes.

Each Support Pod may have specific recommendations on integrating its work into
your day-to-day. These recommendations should be documented in the Support Pod's
README in the [Support Pods project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-pods).
