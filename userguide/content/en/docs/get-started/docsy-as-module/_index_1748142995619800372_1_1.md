title: CI/CD Support Pod
description: Discuss CI/CD related tickets/issues, learn about CI/CD features and improve related documentation.
---

## Purpose

Discuss CI/CD related tickets/issues, learn about CI/CD features and improve related documentation.

## Scope

Topics in this pod will ideally align with these product groups:

- [Pipeline Authoring](/handbook/product/categories/#pipeline-authoring-group)
- [Pipeline Execution](/handbook/product/categories/#pipeline-execution-group)
- [Pipeline Security](/handbook/product/categories/#pipeline-security-group)

In the context of "CI/CD" it can be hard to pinpoint where exactly a problem fits in. This list is not meant to discourage anyone from seeking help in the pod â€“ when in doubt, ask away! The worst that could happen is that someone suggest a better place for the question.

## Current objectives

- Keep regular meetings going
- Stay updated on all things CI/CD
- Help each other with CI/CD tickets!
