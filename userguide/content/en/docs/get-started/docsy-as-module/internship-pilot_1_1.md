## Business Goal

Run a pilot internship program to determine feasibility for future programs.

Overview:

1. Intention of hiring available candidates that perform well at the end of the internship
1. Limit duration (see exit criteria)
1. Open to anyone starting their career in tech (not just students)
1. Timeline:
    1. Design in Oct
    1. Recruiting in Nov
    1. Offers in Dec
    1. Internship start June 2020
1. We welcome applications from anyone. 100% of the active sourcing our talent acquisition department will do will be from groups under-represented in the technology industry. This is in order to make the candidate pool more reflective of society at large. Offers will be made purely based on merit.

## Phase 1 - Design program

Phase 1 focuses on designing and launching the internship program with the primary objective of designing the program and getting to the point of being able to recruit and interview candidates.

## Phase 2 - Kick-off program

Phase 2 starts with the launch of the internship applications and has the primary objective of overseeing the recruitment, interviewing and hiring of interns and ensuring all program details are fleshed out.

The working group will dissolve once the exit criteria for these objectives are met and the program lead and coordinators will then take over the running of the program and seeing it through to completion.
