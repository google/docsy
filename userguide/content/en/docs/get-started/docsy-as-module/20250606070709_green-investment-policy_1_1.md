Green Investment Policy: Funding Projects that Promote Environmental Sustainability (Including Pensions and Banking)

1. Introduction

Green Orbit Digital is deeply committed to fostering a sustainable future by funding projects that prioritise environmental sustainability, technological innovation, and responsible stewardship. Recognising the growing need for responsible finance, we aim to direct our financial resources—whether through direct investments, pension funds, or banking relationships—towards projects and initiatives that align with our core values of sustainability, social equity, and ethical responsibility. This Green Investment Policy outlines the principles, goals, and strategies we will employ to ensure that all investments—whether in projects, pension schemes, or banking arrangements—are in line with global sustainability standards and our long-term environmental objectives.

2. Purpose

The purpose of this Green Investment Policy is to:

- Provide a comprehensive framework for funding decisions across all financial channels, ensuring that all resources contribute to environmental sustainability.

- Align Green Orbit Digital’s investments and banking relationships with our broader mission to foster the responsible development of space technologies and other sectors that promote environmental and social benefits.

- Ensure that the company’s pension schemes, banking relationships, and investment strategies align with our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria.

- Promote responsible business practices by encouraging partners, financial institutions, and banks to adopt green, ethical, and sustainable practices.

3. Scope

This policy applies to all financial activities of Green Orbit Digital, including:

- Direct investments in sustainable projects and startups focused on clean technologies, renewable energy, and environmental stewardship.

- Pension fund management, ensuring that employee retirement savings are invested in line with ESG principles.

- Banking relationships, including the management of corporate funds and working capital, ensuring that Green Orbit Digital only works with financial institutions that align with sustainability and responsible finance practices.

4. Investment Principles

Green Orbit Digital’s investment philosophy is grounded in the following core principles:

1. Environmental Stewardship: All investments must have a measurable, positive environmental impact. We prioritise projects that promote renewable energy, reduce carbon emissions, promote resource conservation, and ensure the protection of natural ecosystems.

We seek investments that also address social equity, including projects that promote job creation, sustainable economic growth, and community development, particularly in underserved regions.

1. Innovative and Scalable Solutions: We focus on investing in companies and projects that offer innovative solutions to environmental problems. These solutions should be scalable, replicable, and able to make a long-term impact on the environment.

1. Ethical Practices: Green Orbit Digital only invests in businesses that operate with a strong ethical foundation, ensuring fair labour practices, transparent governance, and respect for human rights.

1. Pension Fund Alignment: We ensure that pension funds are invested in line with the company’s sustainability ethos, prioritising funds and asset managers that integrate ESG principles into their investment strategies and exclude industries that contribute to environmental harm or social injustice.

1. Banking Relationships: We engage with financial institutions that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable finance, with policies in place to support green projects and avoid financing environmentally harmful industries. We favour banking relationships with institutions that practice responsible lending, promote ESG-aligned financial products, and have transparent environmental policies.
