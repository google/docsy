### Slack Groups

Slack Groups are groups of members in a workspace who often need to be notified at once. The Field organization has multiple Slack Groups that effectively allow a group of people to be cc'd on a Slack communication. Please note that Slack groups send a push notification to all members and should be used sparingly, in accordance with the [guidelines around @here mentions in the Handbook](/handbook/communication/#be-respectful-of-others-time).

Only use Slack Groups if:

1. The content of the message is hyper-relevant to ALL members of the group
1. The content of the message is time-sensitive and/or needs immediate action
1. The content of the message has significant impact to the business and/or team

**Customer Success**
Consistent with company guidance to use [public channels](/handbook/communication/#use-public-channels), there are instances where private channels are preferred. As we want to ensure an [inclusive environment](/handbook/values/#diversity-inclusion), the feedback from some of the team is that private channels are sometimes preferred as there is a perception of being judged (i.e., imposter syndrome). The recommendation is to use public channels as it:

- Allows for broader collaboration (i.e., SA/CSM/PS, Product, Marketing, Sales) on solutions, recommendations, and best practices
- Provides ability for broader learning for things such as customer challenges, enablement needs, product documentation improvements, etc.
- Enables the ability to harvest the information for content (i.e., CSM solutions, adoption content for digital journey, product documentation)
The recommendation is to use public channels even while it may sometimes feel uncomforable as we [want to embrace this](/handbook/values/#embracing-uncomfortable-ideas-and-conversations).
