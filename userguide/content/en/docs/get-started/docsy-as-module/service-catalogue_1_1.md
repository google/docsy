At Green Orbit Digital, we offer a range of flexible pricing models to suit different client needs. These models ensure transparency and scalability for projects of all sizes.

### 1. Fixed-Price Projects

For projects with clearly defined scopes and deliverables, we offer fixed-price contracts. This model provides clients with certainty regarding the total cost of the project and is ideal for projects such as brand strategy development, campaign planning, or website design.

- Fixed-price projects are generally outlined in detail during the proposal phase.

- A down payment is required before work begins, with the remaining balance due upon project completion.

### 2. Retainer-Based Services

For ongoing support or services requiring continuous engagement (e.g., digital marketing, social media management, SEO), we offer monthly retainer agreements. These allow businesses to access our expertise on an ongoing basis while benefiting from discounted rates compared to one-time project pricing.

- Retainer agreements can be adjusted based on the level of service needed.

- Clients can cancel or adjust the retainer agreement with a 30-day notice period.

### 3. Hourly Billing

For ad-hoc services or projects that may not require a full engagement, we offer hourly billing. This is ideal for tasks like copywriting, one-off consultations, or quick design updates.

- Hourly rate: £150/hour

- Clients are billed monthly for hours worked.

### 4. Custom Packages

For clients who require a mix of services, we offer custom packages tailored to their unique needs. These can combine multiple services, such as a combination of brand strategy, digital marketing, and SEO, at a discounted rate.

- Custom packages are designed after an initial consultation, where we discuss project goals and requirements.

- A detailed proposal with package pricing will be provided after the consultation.

## C. Considerations for Pricing

When determining the cost of a service, several factors are taken into account:

- Scope and Complexity: The more complex or extensive the project, the higher the price. For example, large-scale digital transformations or advanced custom development will require more resources and time.

- Customisation: Tailored or custom services that require specific integrations (such as space technology or data analysis) may result in higher pricing.

- Timeline: Urgent or expedited projects may incur additional costs depending on the level of resource allocation needed to meet deadlines.

- Ongoing Support: For services requiring long-term support or maintenance, ongoing costs will be assessed based on the level of service needed.

## D. Discounts and Special Offers

Green Orbit Digital offers discounts on select services for long-term contracts or partnerships, as well as special offers for first-time clients or referrals. Discounts are typically applied to services such as retainer agreements, large-scale digital projects, or bundled service packages.
