## Mission

The mission of the generational understanding [TMRG]({{< ref "erg-guide" >}}) is to ensure that team members of all ages feel they have a safe space to communicate, unite and share issues that are reflective of their experience while at GitLab, and to explicitly foster more sharing of wisdom across generations. We encourage a work culture where GitLab team members of all ages are valued, empowered, and given opportunities to develop and contribute to their full potential. This culture will be a competitive advantage for GitLab, as it helps GitLab become a thought leader on this topic. It will leverage the wisdom of all team members, as it helps identify ongoing patterns as well as best practices for mentoring.

## Lead(s)

- [Terri Chu](https://gitlab.com/terrichu) - from middle 1/3 of current workplace generations.

### Past Activities

#### [Film Discussion - Duty Free](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/book-clubs/-/issues/26)

Join our Film Discussion. In this iteration, we're watching the film "Duty Free". About the film:

> After a 75 year-old immigrant mother gets fired without cause from her lifelong job as a hotel housekeeper, her son takes her on a bucket-list adventure to reclaim her life. As she struggles to find work, he documents a journey that uncovers the economic insecurity shaping not only her future, but that of an entire generation.

The film discussion will take place at the next TMRG meeting on 07/06/2021. Add yourself to the Film Discussion issue linked above and join us for the Zoom discussion or contribution asynchronously through the issue.

#### [Book Club - Wisdom at Work](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/book-clubs/-/issues/13)

Join our Book Club! In this iteration, we're discussing the book "Wisdom at Work: The Making of a Modern Elder" by Chip Conley. The book is self-described as:

> Part manifesto and part playbook, Wisdom@Work ignites an urgent conversation about ageism in the workplace, calling on us to treat age as we would other type of diversity. In the process, Conley liberates the term "elder" from the stigma of "elderly," and inspires us to embrace wisdom as a path to growing whole, not old. Whether you've been forced to make a mid-career change, are choosing to work past retirement age, or are struggling to keep up with the millennials rising up the ranks, Wisdom@Work will help you write your next chapter.

Our current book club discussions are running from 10/29/2020 through 12/10/2020. Add yourself to the Book Club issue linked above and join us in our Zoom meetings or contribute asynchronously through our issue discussions.
