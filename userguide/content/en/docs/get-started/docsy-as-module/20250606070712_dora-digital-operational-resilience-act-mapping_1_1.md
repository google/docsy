### How GitLab addresses the key contractual requirements of the Digital Operational Resilience Act

## Important Notice

The information in this summary is intended as an overview and outline of certain Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”) related matters. Its purpose is to inform and raise awareness amongst GitLab’s current and prospective customers who fall under the DORA regulation. This DORA Mapping does not provide legal advice and shall not be construed or used as such, nor does this document form part of, create or amend any agreement, representations, warranties or any other obligation between GitLab and its customers. Customers must seek and rely only on independent legal advice on any DORA related matter and customers acknowledge that they remain solely responsible for complying with their legal and regulatory requirements. GitLab shall have no liability arising from any errors, misstatements or omissions in the content of this DORA Mapping document.

## Regulatory Context

The Digital Operational Resilience Act was created to harmonise security and resilience practices across Financial Entities (“FEs”) operating in the European Union, and requires that all financial market participants, including stakeholders in the financial sector, which so far have not been subject to extensive ICT security regulation (credit institutions, payment institutions, account information service providers, electronic money institutions, investment firms, insurance companies, crypto-asset service providers, exchanges and clearing houses, alternative fund managers, pension, credit rating agencies, etc) can maintain resilient operations through severe operational disruption caused by cyber security and information and communication technology (ICT) issues. DORA does not override any existing cyber security regulations applicable to the financial sector (such as NIS-2, EBA etc), it exists alongside those. While GitLab has not historically been considered an outsourcing partner under the EBA Guidelines, DORA doesn’t just apply to outsourcing arrangements, but to the use of all “ICT Services”, casting a much broader net amongst information technology providers. Accordingly, GitLab wishes to help our customers better understand how they may comply with their DORA requirement in the context of their use of GitLab’s DevSecOps platform. DORA officially came into effect on the 16th of January, 2023 and its provisions apply and are enforceable from the 17th of January, 2025 following the implementation period.

## GitLab’s Approach
