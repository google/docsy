  The plugin loop's shim contract, shape guards, build pipeline, and the
  security rules Docsy's own plugins follow
---

[`_partials/scripts/plugins.html`][plugins.html] implements
`params.docsy.plugins`. For the configuration reference and the plugin file
contract, see the [plugins guide][guide]; for the design rationale, the [design
notes][design]; for the tests that pin this contract, the [quality
notes][quality].

## Loop mechanics

The template's comments carry the mechanics and their rationale. The loop reads
the theme's schema through `hugo.Data`; the guide [renders the same
file][guide-config], so the entry contract has one home.

## Shims

For when to add or replace a shim, see the guide's [Adjust a plugin per
page][guide-shims]; this section is the contract.

The loop resolves a shim by registry name with the schema's reserved
`_docsy-shim` suffix and, when the partial exists, invokes it with
`(dict "Page" PAGE "Plugin" ENTRY)`: the page being rendered, and the merged,
normalized entry. The call comes after normalization and name validation, so a
shim cannot reorder emission. It comes before the required-field and `version`
guards, the enable check, and asset lookup, so a shim runs for a disabled entry
too, and what it returns is what those two guards test.

The partial must return the entry it received, adjusted with `merge` so the
fields it leaves alone keep their normalized values; anything but a map fails
the build.

A shim is also where a plugin gates itself: on a page that doesn't need the
plugin, it returns the entry with `enable` false ([Gating
decisions][design-gating]). A shim is likewise where a plugin pins an author
field: the click-to-copy and Mermaid shims set `_defer` true
([guide][guide-loading]). Two more jobs a shim takes on:

- **Refusing the plugin's retired `params.NAME` namespace**, any key, any page,
  with a build error naming the entry field to set (Mermaid, MarkMap;
  [why][design-registry]).
- **Decoding `options`** into whatever the companion consumes. Mermaid's shim
  decodes the JSON string with `transform.Unmarshal` and fails the build on
  anything but a JSON object, so the companion sees a map or nothing.

A deprecated parameter that is aliased instead (click-to-copy's) keeps its
mapping and warning for a cycle; when the cycle ends, remove both from the shim
and keep the rest.

## Shape guards

Enforcement is hand-coded in the loop against the schema; what each guard warns
about, ignores, or empties is the guide's [Warnings][guide-warnings] list. A
refused `version` skips the entry.

## Build and emission

The [file contract][guide-files] is the guide's; the pipeline adds one step
beyond it, minification in production ([why companions first][design-ordering]).

## Security constraints

Docsy's own plugins follow the guide's [rules for plugin
authors][guide-security]. In addition:

- Validate a configuration value against an allowlist before it reaches a fetch
  URL: the loop does this for every supplied entry `version`, so a companion
  only checks that its plugin provides a pin.
- Residual exposure, disclosed in the guide's [MarkMap version][guide-markmap]
  section: the autoloader's runtime libraries.
- Imported Hugo modules are trusted: their `params` merge into the site's, so a
  module can register or turn off plugins, and its layouts can shim them, as it
  already supplies layouts and assets.
- Exception to the vendoring rule: Mermaid is not vendored. Its companion checks
  the pin exists on the CDN at build time, and the browser imports the library
  from the CDN at runtime, as before 0.18; SRI covers Docsy's entry, not the
  imported library. Vendoring is deferred.
