  The golden, dispatch, loop-contract, acceptance, and runtime nets, and how to
  refresh the goldens
---

Complementary test nets pin the script-loading subsystem ([design][],
[implementation][]). The fixture-site nets run in `npm run test:repo`; the
browser nets run in `npm run test:visual`.

## Golden net

[`scripts-golden.test.mjs`][golden-test] pins, across fixture configurations:

- the rendered **script region** of selected pages, and
- **every locally built script**, byte-exact.

Fixture builds, region extraction, and the comparison form live in
[`lib/scripts-goldens.mjs`][goldens-lib]. The net was committed and verified
green against untouched `main` before the `scripts.html` decomposition, so the
refactor's no-output-change claim is machine-checked, not asserted.

The goldens are committed. After a reviewed, intended output change, refresh
them with:

```sh
npm run update:scripts-goldens
```

## Dispatch net

[`scripts-dispatch.test.mjs`][dispatch-test] pins the dispatcher's page-flag
wiring: the `.Page.Store`-gated partials (Mermaid, KaTeX) are dispatched on
flagged pages only. The real partials fetch remote assets at build time, so
fixture marker overrides stand in for them; what's pinned is exactly the
gate-to-partial wiring, offline.

## Loop-contract tests

[`plugins.test.mjs`][loop-test] pins the plugin loop's registry contract:
emission with `@params`, `enable`/`defer`/`pageGate`/`weight` handling, the
scalar `false` shorthand, companions and shims, shape-guard warnings (the
pre-release list shape included), name allowlisting, theme-plugin layering
through Hugo's config merge (inheritance, override, turn-off), and SRI in
development builds. Companion nets:

- [`tabpane-persist-plugin.test.mjs`][tabpane-test]: page gating, persistence
  opt-out, and theme-plugin shadowing.
- [`markmap-plugin.test.mjs`][markmap-test] and
  [`click-to-copy-plugin.test.mjs`][c2c-test]: the per-conversion contracts.
- [`print-scripts.test.mjs`][print-test]: page-gated scripts reach section print
  output (the descendant flag merge).

## Acceptance test

[`plugins-acceptance.test.mjs`][acceptance-test] proves adoption end to end: a
project site drops `assets/js/plugins/hello.js` plus one registry entry and gets
its script loaded, with zero layout overrides asserted structurally (the fixture
contains no `layouts/` directory).

## Runtime nets

Two browser nets under `tests/visual/`:

- [`js-runtime.test.mjs`][runtime-test] loads representative fixture pages in a
  real browser and asserts that no uncaught exception or in-scope console error
  fires, alongside behavior probes (search, diagrams, navbar). Markup and visual
  goldens can't see JS runtime breakage (a missing global, a botched
  conversion); this net can ([#1436][]).
  - Two fixture variants cover both search bundles: the main bundle
    (`scripts/main-bundle.html`) concatenates `offline-search.js` or `search.js`
    into `main.js`, never both.
  - Pages load their real CDN script dependencies, so the net needs network
    access. The console tally filters off-origin and non-code resource noise but
    keeps same-origin script and stylesheet load failures (a broken first-party
    bundle is a defect). Filtered breakage that throws (a dependent script's
    missing global) still surfaces as a page error; silent feature degradation
    is what the behavior probes catch.
- [`plugins-runtime.test.mjs`][plugin-runtime-test] proves an emitted plugin
  actually executes: its options reach the runtime and its DOM effects land. A
  static-markup check can bless output whose runtime is broken (a botched
  build); this net can't.

## Red-proof rationale

A net that passes for the wrong reason (building nothing, matching an empty
region) is worse than a red one: it hides breakage behind green. The nets were
built red-first, and where a no-op could masquerade as success, a persistent
safeguard proves the signal:

- Zero-output cases are asserted against: a golden's script region must be
  non-empty.
- The plugin runtime net's red-proof doubles as an assertion: a deliberately
  broken plugin must be the error tally's only entry, so an empty tally from the
  healthy plugin is meaningful.
- The site runtime net carries a collector self-test: a page that deliberately
  throws and drops a same-origin script must have both reported, so a silent
  collector (wrong event names, races, a broken filter) can't masquerade as
  all-green.
