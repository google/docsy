## Agent-support checks

The site has an [AFDocs][] configuration and npm script to generate a scorecard
locally:

- Config: [docsy.dev/agent-docs.config.yml][]
- Script: `_check:afdocs` in [docsy.dev/package.json][]

To generate a fresh scorecard, run each of these commands in separate terminals:

```sh
npm run serve             # From one terminal
npm run check:afdocs:dev  # From another terminal
```

The latter command saves the generated scorecard to
`docs/content/agent-support/afdocs-scorecard.txt` under `docsy.dev/content/en`,
which will be included in [Scorecard examples][] on the next build.

Note that the scorecard generation is not run as a part of the full CI/CD
pipeline. It needs to be run manually.

## Prettier formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format Docsy and the website files
using the following command:

```sh
npm run check:format
```

To fix formatting, run:

```sh
npm run fix:format
```

### Workaround for `i18n` files

The translation files in the `i18n` directory are formatted using Prettier. But
Prettier removes the blank line before the `# Feedback` section heading. This
seems to be a known issue, for example see:

- [Bug: Inconsistent newline formatting in YAML when changing scopes
  #15528][#15528]
- [Bug: New Line before comments at end of YAML files are removed
  #15720][#15720]

We've worked around this bug, and avoided using `prettier-ignore` directives, by
formatting the preceding entry in the YAML file to be a block scalar, like this:

```yaml
community_guideline: >-
  Contribution Guidelines
```

This ensures that the blank line is preserved. Hopefully Prettier will be fixed
and we'll be able to remove this hack.
