## {{% _param FA compass "" %}} Navigation and UX improvements {#navigation-and-ux}

### {{% _param NEW %}} Active TOC entry tracking {#active-toc-entry-tracking}

Docsy 0.13.0 introduces _active table of contents (TOC) entry tracking_, the
**most upvoted** enhancement [request of 2025][]. This feature highlights the
TOC entry corresponding to the page's section that is currently in view. The
feature is implemented using (a [patched] version of) Bootstrap’s [ScrollSpy][].
The new default TOC labels “On this page” and “Top of page” are localizable. For
details, see [Active TOC entry tracking with ScrollSpy][].

[Active TOC entry tracking with ScrollSpy]:
  /docs/content/navigation/#toc-entry-tracking
[ScrollSpy]: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/scrollspy/
[patched]: /site/implementation/scrollspy-patch/

{{% alert title="Want to hide the TOC?" color="info" %}}

The `notoc` page parameter (available since 2016, [now documented][#2405]) hides
the TOC for specific pages. For details, see [TOC customization][].

[#2405]: https://github.com/google/docsy/pull/2405

{{% /alert %}}

[TOC customization]: /docs/content/navigation/#toc-customization

### {{% _param NEW %}} Section sidebar root {#section-sidebar-root}

Docsy 0.13.0 introduces the `sidebar_root_for` configuration option, which
allows you to scope sidebar navigation to specific sections. This is
particularly useful for large sites where you want different navigation trees
for different sections, and [docs-only] sites that also have non-docs sections.

To enable this feature, add `sidebar_root_for` to your page front matter.
Supported parameter values are `children` and `self`. For details and examples,
see the [Section sidebar root][] documentation; for implementation details, see
[#2328] and PR [#2364].

[docs-only]: /docs/content/adding-content/#alternative-site-structure
[Section sidebar root]: /docs/content/navigation/#sidebar-root
[#2364]: https://github.com/google/docsy/pull/2364

### {{% _param BREAKING %}} Language menu visibility {#language-menu-visibility}

Prior to Docsy 0.13.0, the [language selector menu][lang-menu] was shown for
multilingual sites in both the navbar and the sidebar, depending on the viewport
width according to the following table:

| Location    | Wide viewport | Narrow viewport |
| ----------- | :-----------: | :-------------: |
| **Navbar**  |    Visible    |     Hidden      |
| **Sidebar** |    Hidden     |     Visible     |

The change in visibility was triggered by the Bootstrap `lg` breakpoint (the
point where layouts switch between wide and narrow).

The new visibility under 0.13.0 is as follows for all viewport widths:

| Location    | All viewport widths |
| ----------- | :-----------------: |
| **Navbar**  |       Visible       |
| **Sidebar** |       Hidden        |

This is a {{% _param BADGE BREAKING warning %}} UX change. You can recover
legacy behavior as follows:

- **Navbar**: add the following SCSS (or equivalent) to your project’s styles to
  restore the previous `d-none d-lg-block` behavior:

  ```scss
  .td-navbar__lang-menu {
    @extend .d-none;
    @extend .d-lg-block;
  }
  ```

- **Sidebar**: set the optional parameter `.ui.sidebar_lang_menu` to `true` in
  your site configuration.

To learn more about the language menu, see [Adding a language menu][lang-menu].
For implementation details, see [#2035], [#2001], and PR [#2303].

[lang-menu]: /docs/content/navigation/#language-menu
[#2303]: https://github.com/google/docsy/pull/2303

### Mobile navbar scroll indicators

The navbar now shows left/right scroll indicators when the navigation menu
overflows (mainly for narrow viewports), making it easier for users to discover
additional navigation items ([#2406]).

[#2406]: https://github.com/google/docsy/pull/2406

## {{% _param FA code "" %}} Alert shortcode improvements {#alert-shortcode}

As of Docsy 0.13.0, `alert` shortcode content is processed differently when
called as Markdown (`{{%/* alert */%}}`): the inner Markdown is now passed
through to the page’s Markdown renderer and processed along with the rest of the
page content. Previously, the shortcode used Hugo’s `markdownify` function
internally.

This change means that your alerts can now:

- Contain calls to other shortcodes, that is, **nested shortcode** calls
- Contain and share **link definitions** from or with other parts of the page
- Be used in lists and other **indented contexts**
- Include **headings** that appear in the page TOC (for `docs` pages)

For details and examples, including important formatting requirements, see
[alert]. For implementation details, see PR [#941].

## {{% _param FA universal-access info %}} Accessibility improvements {#accessibility}

- <i class="fa-solid fa-palette fa-lg text-info px-1"></i> **Color contrast**
  has been improved throughout the theme, and Docsy now falls back to Bootstrap
  defaults for typography and color. This ensures better accessibility
  compliance out of the box. For details, see [#2285] and [Site colors][].

- {{% _param FA palette info %}} **Color contrast** improvements for dark mode:
  - TOC entry color contrast has been fixed when user preferences differ from
    system settings ([#2379]).

  - Early experimental support for customizable color-contrast adjustments for
    projects using Bootstrap's theme variables ([#2384]). For details, see [How
    to pick colors with good color-contrast][].
    {{% _param BADGE EXPERIMENTAL info %}}

- {{% _param FA moon info %}} **[Dark mode][]**:
  - {{% _param FA bolt warning %}} [Flash Of Unstyled Content][] (FOUC) has been
    fixed ([#2332]).
  - {{% _param FA search info %}} **Google search** results page now supports
    dark-mode ([#2387]). {{%_param BADGE EXPERIMENTAL info %}}

  {{% alert title="Dark mode quick reference" color="secondary" %}}

  To opt into all [dark mode][] features (including experimental ones), add the
  following imports to your [\_styles_project.scss][project-style-files]. For
  details, see [Light/dark color modes][].

  ```scss
  // Dark mode enhancements
  @import 'td/color-adjustments-dark';
  @import 'td/code-dark';
  @import 'td/gcs-search-dark';
  ```

## Other notable changes

- **Better NPM support**: Projects using [Docsy via NPM] will no longer face
  optional and peer dependency issues ([#2115]).

- **Translations** (**i18n**): Occitan locale has been added ([#2173]), and
  Simplified Chinese ([#2313]) and Ukrainian ([#2331]) [translation files][]
  have been refreshed.

- **New `_param` shortcode**: A new experimental shortcode for parameter
  substitution in templates, useful for dynamic content generation. See PR
  [#2371] for details.

- **Mathematical and chemical formulae**: Docsy now uses Hugo's embedded KaTeX
  engine for build-time rendering. The `mhchem` extension is now built-in. For
  details, see [LaTeX support with KaTeX][diagrams-formulae] ([#2276], [#2394],
  [#2395]).

  The KaTeX engine auto-activates when formulae are encountered; no
  configuration needed, so projects can remove the following obsolete site
  configuration: `params.katex.*`. Subfields include `enable`,
  `html_dom_element`, `options`, and `mhchem`.

## {{% _param FA rocket primary %}} Upgrade to 0.13.0 {#upgrade}

### Prerequisites

> {{% _param FA triangle-exclamation warning %}} **We recommend** that you
> [Upgrade to Docsy 0.12.0][] first because it contains significant breaking
> changes.

### Upgrade procedure and AI help {#upgrading-and-ai}

> {{% _param FA robot info %}} Have you used AI to help you upgrade Docsy? It
> can be a big help!

The [0.12.0 upgrade guide][] was written with both human project maintainers and
AI assistants in mind. In fact, I've successfully used it to upgrade projects
like [The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.io) website. That is,
using only the upgrade guide as input, an AI assistant created [TUF PR #126]
fully autonomously. All I had to do was review it.

[0.12.0 upgrade guide]: /blog/2025/0.12.0/
[TUF PR #126]:
  https://github.com/theupdateframework/theupdateframework.io/pull/126

To upgrade from [0.12.0] to [0.13.0], follow the same steps as described in
[Upgrade to Docsy 0.12.0 from 0.11.0][upgrade-0.12], but use version 0.13.0
instead:

- **Docsy**: [0.12.0] → [0.13.0]<br> Includes **Bootstrap**: 5.3.6 → 5.3.8
- **Hugo**: 0.147.5 → 0.152.2&nbsp;[^vers-note]
- **Node**: LTS 22 → LTS 24&nbsp;[^vers-note]

[^vers-note]:
    These are the officially supported Node.js and Hugo versions associated with
    the named Docsy versions. Later versions may work, but are not officially
    supported.

After upgrading, review the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes) and test your
site thoroughly. For a testing checklist, see the [Upgrade to Docsy
0.12.0][upgrade-0.12] guide.

{{% alert title="Hugo 0.152.0 and 0.152.1 are not supported" color="warning" %}}

Hugo 0.152.0 or 0.152.1 are not compatible with Docsy 0.13.0 ([#2347]); use Hugo
0.152.2 or later.
