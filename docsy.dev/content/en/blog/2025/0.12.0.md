Since we didn't publish a release announcement for 0.12.0, I'm using this
opportunity to walk through the upgrade process from [0.11.0] to [0.12.0].

> **TL;DR:** The main breaking changes in Docsy [0.12.0] stem from Hugo's [new
> template system][NTS], which causes `layouts` subfolder and filename changes.

In this post you'll walk through the upgrade process for:

- **Docsy**: [0.11.0] → [0.12.0]
- **Hugo** peer version upgrade[^1]: 0.136.2 → 0.147.5

[0.11.0]: /project/changelog/#0110
[0.12.0]: /project/changelog/#0120

[^1]:
    These are the officially supported Hugo versions associated with the named
    Docsy versions. Later versions may work, but are not officially supported.

This post covers the common upgrade steps you're likely to encounter. Your
project may include customizations that require additional adjustments. We
recommend making these changes in a **separate branch** and **testing
thoroughly** before deploying to production.

## A. Docsy and Hugo version upgrades

### 1. Update Docsy

- If using NPM:

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev google/docsy#semver:0.12.0
  ```

- If using Hugo modules:

  ```bash
  hugo mod get -u github.com/google/docsy@v0.12.0
  ```

- If using Git submodule:

  ```bash
  cd themes/docsy
  git fetch --tags
  git checkout v0.12.0
  cd ../..
  git add themes/docsy
  ```

### 2. Update Hugo version

Update Hugo to 0.147.5, even if you are targeting a higher version of Hugo. We
recommend that you update to a higher version in a separate step, after the
Docsy upgrade.

How you do this depends on how your project manages its Hugo dependency. For
projects using [hugo-extended], update the NPM package version. Update the NPM
lockfile or any cache keys to force a CI/CD cache refresh. For example:

```bash
npm install --save-exact -D hugo-extended@0.147.5
```

[hugo-extended]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/hugo-extended

### 3. Install dependencies

If using Git submodule, install Docsy dependencies:

```bash
npm install
(cd themes/docsy && npm install)
```

## B. Layouts directory changes

In line with Hugo's [new template system][NTS], Docsy v0.12.0 reorganizes the
`layouts` directory as follows[^2]:

- Move `_markup` one level up:

  ```
  layouts/_default/_markup/  → layouts/_markup/
  ```

- Add underscore prefixes to subfolders:

  ```
  layouts/partials/     → layouts/_partials/
  layouts/shortcodes/   → layouts/_shortcodes/
  ```

- Relocate and rename [taxonomy files](#taxonomy-files) (if applicable):

  ```
  layouts/_default/taxonomy.html → layouts/term.html
  layouts/_default/terms.html    → layouts/taxonomy.html
  ```

[^2]: For implementation details, see issue [#2243].

The following commands can help you move your custom layout files and folders
<a name="move-layout-files"></a>:

1. Move your custom layout files and folders:

   ```bash
   # If you have custom partials
   git mv layouts/partials/* layouts/_partials/

   # If you have custom shortcodes
   git mv layouts/shortcodes/* layouts/_shortcodes/

   # If you have custom markup render hooks
   git mv layouts/_default/_markup/* layouts/_markup/

   # If you have custom taxonomy layouts
   git mv layouts/_default/taxonomy.html layouts/term.html
   git mv layouts/_default/terms.html layouts/taxonomy.html

   # Clean up empty directories
   rmdir layouts/partials layouts/shortcodes layouts/_default/_markup layouts/_default
   ```

2. Update Docsy template references:

   If you have `layouts/_markup/render-heading.html` that references Docsy's
   heading template:

   ```diff
   - {{ template "_default/_markup/td-render-heading.html" . -}}
   + {{ partial "td/render-heading.html" . -}}
   ```

   Note: The `td` prefix moved from filename to the directory path.

## C. Check for additional required changes

### 1. Image fingerprints

Skip this step if your project's CSS/SCSS does **not** use `blocks/cover`
[hero/background images][images].

Hugo generates new image [fingerprints]. Projects that refer to [hero/background
image paths][images] in their CSS/SCSS will need to update references to the new
image fingerprints. This includes projects with strict Content Security Policy
(CSP) configurations, for example.

1. Build your site: `npm run build`
2. Check `public` or `resources/_gen/images/` for image file names with new
   fingerprints
3. Update references in your stylesheets

[images]: /docs/adding-content/iconsimages/#landing-pages

### 2. Taxonomy files {#taxonomy-files}

If your project overrides taxonomy layouts, note that in addition to moving the
files, you need to:

- **Swap** the layout files
- **Rename** the `terms` file to be **singular**: `terms.html` → `term.html`

For CLI commands, see the [Move layout files](#move-layout-files) step.

### 3. Internal layout `content.html` file rename

If your project overrides Docsy `layouts/**/content.html` files:

- Prefix your file names with `_td-`: `content.html` → `_td-content.html`

These are the affected files:

```
layouts/_td-content-after-header.html
layouts/_td-content.html
layouts/blog/_td-content.html
```

## Testing your site

Build your site to check for errors, especially template-not-found errors and
missing layout files:

```bash
npm run build
```

We recommend doing this for both development **and** production builds.

Then serve your site to verify that it renders as expected. For example:

```bash
npm run serve
```

### Testing checklist

Use this checklist to verify that your upgrade succeeded:

- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] All pages render correctly
- [ ] CSS/SCSS compiles properly
- [ ] External link styling works
- [ ] [Heading self-links] work and are styled correctly
- [ ] Navigation and breadcrumbs work
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works (if enabled)
- [ ] Mobile/responsive layout works
- [ ] Custom shortcodes work
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Print layouts work (if used)
