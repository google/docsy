## {{% _param NEW %}} Markdown alert syntax {#alerts}

Docsy 0.14.0 adds support for Hugo's Markdown alert syntax, like this:

```markdown
> [!NOTE] :star: Markdown alert syntax
>
> This syntax is more author, tooling, and AI friendly.
```

Which renders as:

> [!NOTE] :star: Markdown alert syntax
>
> This syntax is more author, tooling, and AI friendly.

While we continue to support the [alert shortcode][], we recommend using the
Markdown alert syntax whenever possible. For details about the supported syntax,
and how to customize the appearance of alerts, see [Alerts][].

[alert shortcode]: /docs/content/shortcodes/#alert
[Alerts]: /docs/content/adding-content/#alerts

## Improved separation of project and internal SCSS files {#improved-scss-soc}

Docsy 0.14.0 moves all internal SCSS files from `assets/scss/` into the
`assets/scss/td/` subdirectory. This change distinguishes project customization
files from internal theme files and prevents projects from inadvertently
overriding internal SCSS files. For details on how to customize Docsy's look and
feel for your project, see [Project styles][] that covers:

- [Project style files][]: the files supported for project SCSS customization
- [Advanced style customization][]

### Action required {#action-required-post-scss-file-move}

If your project has any of the files listed below in `assets/scss/`, you're
overriding Docsy's internal SCSS files.

</details>

To continue using your customizations from `_abc.scss` add the following import
to your `_styles_project.scss` file:

```scss
@import 'abc';
```

Alternatively, you can copy the styles directly into your `_styles_project.scss`
file.

For details about style customizations, see [Project style files][] and
[Advanced style customization][].

## {{% _param BREAKING %}} Swagger UI style customization {#swagger-scss}

Prior to 0.14.0, the Docsy User Guide incorrectly recommended overriding
`_swagger.scss` to customize [Swagger UI][] styles. Docsy's internal SCSS files
are not intended to be overridden. The User Guide has been corrected, but since
this was documented, moving the file constitutes a breaking change.

If your project has Swagger UI style customizations, follow the steps in
[Action required](#action-required-post-scss-file-move) to continue using your
customizations.

[Swagger UI]: /docs/content/shortcodes/#swaggerui

## {{% _param BREAKING %}} Hugo 0.153+ upgrade {#hugo}

Docsy 0.14.0 requires **Hugo 0.154.5**, upgraded from 0.152.2 in Docsy 0.13.0.
This upgrade includes several breaking changes introduced in Hugo 0.153+ that
may affect your site.

### Breaking changes in Hugo 0.153+

Hugo 0.153+ introduces several breaking changes that you should be aware of:

- **macOS installations**: Hugo installation on macOS needs to be handled
  differently as of 0.153.0. See
  [issue #2429](https://github.com/google/docsy/issues/2429) for details.
- **Default language alias**: Changes to default language alias behavior may
  cause refresh page issues. See
  [gohugoio/hugo#14361](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/14361) for
  details.
- **Page aliases**: Page aliases may refer to the wrong language in some
  configurations. See [issue #2433](https://github.com/google/docsy/issues/2433)
  for details.

### New Hugo features

Hugo 0.154.4+ introduces new features that may be useful:

- **Canonical method**: New `canonical` method available on page output formats.
  See
  [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/methods/page/outputformats/#canonical).
- **disableDefaultLanguageRedirect**: Configuration option available since Hugo
  0.140.0. See
  [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/configuration/languages/#disabledefaultlanguageredirect).

### Resources for Hugo upgrade

For a comprehensive list of issues and considerations when upgrading to Hugo
0.153+, see [Hugo 0.153+ upgrade & issues (#2431)][#2431]. This issue tracks the
various problems we've encountered (and that other projects might face) during
the upgrade process.

**Before upgrading**, we strongly recommend:

1. Review Hugo's release notes for versions 0.153.0 through 0.154.5
2. Test your site with Hugo 0.154.5 in a development environment
3. Check for any custom Hugo configurations that might be affected
4. Review the [Hugo 0.153+ upgrade tracking issue][#2431] for known issues and
   workarounds

### {{% _param FA globe "" %}} Internationalization improvements {#internationalization}

This release includes significant improvements to internationalization support:

- **i18n file format migration**: All translation files have been converted from
  TOML to YAML format for better maintainability and consistency
- **Bengali localization**: Added feedback section and table of contents
  translations, fixed newline issues, added alert labels
- **Serbian translations**: Updated both Cyrillic and Latin variants
- **Chinese translations**: Updated Simplified and Traditional Chinese locales,
  added alert labels
- **German localization**: Completed German translation support
- **Japanese translations**: Converted to YAML format, added alert labels and
  all-rights-reserved translations
- **Hebrew translations**: New locale added with alert and table of contents
  labels
- **Ukrainian translations**: Converted to YAML format
- **Alert label translations**: Added across multiple locales for consistent
  alert messaging

These updates improve the experience for users of Docsy sites in these languages
and make the translation files easier to maintain.

## {{% _param FA rocket primary %}} Upgrade to 0.14.0 {#upgrade}

### Prerequisites

> {{% _param FA triangle-exclamation warning %}} **We recommend** that you
> [Upgrade to Docsy 0.13.0][] first because it contains significant breaking
> changes.

### Upgrade procedure

To upgrade from [0.13.0] to [0.14.0], follow the same steps as described in
[Upgrade to Docsy 0.13.0 from 0.12.0][upgrade-0.13], but use version 0.14.0
instead:

- **Docsy**: [0.13.0] → [0.14.0]
- **Hugo**: 0.152.2 → 0.154.5&nbsp;[^vers-note]
- **Node**: LTS 24 (unchanged)

[^vers-note]:
    These are the officially supported Node.js and Hugo versions associated with
    the named Docsy versions. Later versions may work, but are not officially
    supported.

After upgrading, review the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes) and test your
site thoroughly. Pay special attention to:

- **SCSS file reorganization**: See
  [Improved separation of project and internal SCSS files](#improved-scss-soc)
  and [Swagger UI style customization](#swagger-scss)
- **Language aliases**: Verify that default language redirects work correctly
- **Page aliases**: Check that aliases point to the correct language versions
- **macOS installations**: If you're on macOS, ensure Hugo is installed
  correctly
- **Build output**: Verify that your site builds without errors or warnings

For a testing checklist, see the [Upgrade to Docsy 0.13.0][upgrade-0.13] guide.
