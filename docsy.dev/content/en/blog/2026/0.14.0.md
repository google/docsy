## {{% _param NEW %}} Markdown alert syntax {#alerts}

Docsy 0.14.0 adds support for Hugo's Markdown alert syntax that looks like this:

```markdown
> [!NOTE] :star: Markdown alert syntax
>
> This syntax is more author, tooling, and AI friendly.
```

Which renders as:

> [!NOTE] :star: Markdown alert syntax
>
> This syntax is more author, tooling, and AI friendly.

We still support the [alert shortcode][], but recommend the Markdown alert
syntax for new content. For the new alert syntax and customization, see
[Alerts][].

### Actions (optional) {#alerts-actions}

**Applies if** your project uses the `alert` shortcode. Consider migrating to
Markdown alerts for consistency and better authoring/tooling support:

- Use Markdown alert syntax for new content.
- Where the output is equivalent, replace existing `alert` shortcodes with the
  Markdown syntax.
- Keep `alert` shortcodes when you rely on shortcode-specific behavior.

[alert shortcode]: /docs/content/shortcodes/#alert
[Alerts]: /docs/content/adding-content/#alerts

## {{% _param BREAKING %}} Styles and customization {#styles-customization}

This section covers breaking changes (marked :warning:) and new features for the
navbar, [internal] SCSS file reorganization and its impact on Swagger UI
customization.

[internal]: /project/about/changelog/#private

### {{% _param NEW %}} Navbar style improvements {#navbar}

**Highlights:**

- **Light or dark** navbar theme is now configurable _site-wide_ or _per page_,
  defaulting to your site's theme otherwise.
- Navbar **height** is now adjustable via a single SCSS variable!
- **New variables and classes** make it easier to customize the navbar look.
- **Navbar over cover images** now has improved styles and translucency
  behavior.
- **No more accidental SCSS file overrides!** Internal SCSS files now live under
  the private `td/` subdirectory.

Before 0.14.0, the navbar always used a dark theme and primary-colored
background. The navbar's [light/dark color theme][] is now configurable
**site-wide** and **per page**, defaulting to your site's theme. The default
navbar style matches your base site's style for a consistent look and
feel.[^navbar-bg-color]

Navbar **height and styling** are tunable via:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- `$td-navbar-min-height` SCSS variable
- <details><summary>CSS variables (EXPERIMENTAL)</summary>

  - `--td-navbar-bg-color`
  - `--td-navbar-backdrop-filter`
  - `--td-navbar-border-bottom`
  - `--bs-bg-opacity`, used with `--td-navbar-bg-color` for background opacity
  - `--bs-link-underline-opacity`, nav link underline

  </details>

Learn more about the default [Navbar] appearance and [Customizing the navbar][].

[^navbar-bg-color]:
    Before 0.14.0, the navbar background was set to the primary color.

#### Actions: required and optional {#navbar-actions}

You may need to update your project in the following areas:

- {{% _param BREAKING %}} **Navbar light/dark color theme**: applies if you want
  to restore the previous (always dark) behavior. Set `params.ui.navbar_theme`
  to `dark` ([details][navbar-lightdark-theme]).

- {{% _param BREAKING %}} **Navbar over cover**: applies if your project targets
  navbar cover translucency classes.
  - Review and simplify your styles ([navbar cover-image translucency][]).
  - Replace `.navbar-bg-on-scroll` and `.navbar-bg-onscroll--fade` with
    `.td-navbar-transparent` (used alongside `.td-navbar-cover`).

- **Height and variables**: applies if you customize navbar height or styling.
  Review and simplify your customizations using the new variables and styles —
  see [Customizing the navbar][].

- **Navbar partial overrides:** applies if your project overrides the navbar
  partial. Review [_nav.html][] for changes.

  <details>
  <summary class="h6 text-primary"><span class="fas fa-file-alt"></span> Summary of edits to <code>layouts/_partials/navbar.html</code></summary>

  <table class="table-bordered">
    <thead>

    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr><th class="text-center" colspan="2" scope="colgroup">Cover translucency</th></tr>
    <tr><td>
  - `<nav>` had `td-navbar-cover` only
  - Projects used `.navbar-bg-on-scroll`, `.navbar-bg-onscroll--fade`

    </td><td class="border-start">
  - `<nav>` gets `td-navbar-cover` and `td-navbar-transparent`
  - Old classes removed

    </td></tr>
    <tr><th class="text-center" colspan="2" scope="colgroup">Light/dark theme</th></tr>
    <tr><td>
  - `data-bs-theme="dark"` always set on `<nav>`

    </td><td class="border-start">
  - `data-bs-theme="dark"` only when `params.ui.navbar_theme` is `"dark"`
  - Otherwise follows site theme

    </td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

### {{% _param BREAKING %}} Heading aliases and in-page targets {#heading-aliases}

Heading aliases are a useful convention for keeping old [fragment] links
working. In 0.14.0, scrolling behavior is fixed (purely in CSS using
`scroll-padding-top`), so heading alias targets and in-page targets now scroll
to the right place. For details, see the [Heading aliases and in-page
targets][heading-aliases+] and PR [#2505] changes.

[#2505]: https://github.com/google/docsy/pull/2505/changes

#### Actions: required and optional {#heading-aliases-actions}

- {{% _param BREAKING %}} **Applies if** your site uses `td-offset-anchor`; for
  example, if you override `blocks/lead.html`, `blocks/section.html`, or
  `layouts/community/list.html`.

  Rename `td-offset-anchor` to `td-anchor-no-extra-offset`. See [Implementation
  notes][heading-aliases-impl-notes].

- **Scrolling behavior**: applies if you want to ensure proper scrolling
  behavior for your project's existing heading aliases and in-page targets.
  - Update heading aliases and in-page targets to be of the form
    [`<a id="..."></a>`][heading-aliases+], if not already.
  - In particular, replace non-anchor targets such as `<span>` elements with
    `<a id="..."></a>` for more reliable scrolling.
  - Replace legacy targets like `<a name="...">` with `id`-based targets.

  /docs/content/navigation/#heading-aliases-implementation-notes

### Improved separation of project and internal SCSS files {#improved-scss-soc}

Docsy 0.14.0 moves all its [internal] SCSS files from `assets/scss/` into the
`assets/scss/td/` subdirectory. This change clearly distinguishes [project style
files][] from internal theme files and helps projects avoid accidental overrides
of Docsy's internal SCSS files. For details on how to customize Docsy's look and
feel for your project, see [Project styles][] that covers:

- The [project style files][] that are supported for project-specific SCSS
  customization
- [Advanced style customization][] for projects that occasionally need to
  deviate substantially from Docsy's base styles

#### Actions: required and optional {#scss-actions}

**Applies if** your project has any of the files in `assets/scss/` listed next,
because you are overriding Docsy's internal SCSS files.

<details>
<summary>
<span class="text-primary h6">
<span class="fas fa-file-alt"></span>

```

</details>

To continue using your customizations from, for example,
`assets/scss/_table.scss`, add the following import to your
`_styles_project.scss` file:

```scss
@import 'table';
```

Alternatively, you can copy the styles directly into `_styles_project.scss`.

#### {{% _param BREAKING %}} Swagger UI style customization {#swagger-scss}

**Applies if** your project customizes Swagger UI styles.

Before 0.14.0, the User Guide incorrectly recommended overriding `_swagger.scss`
to customize [Swagger UI][] styles. [Internal] SCSS files are not meant to be
overridden; the guide has been corrected. Because the override was documented,
moving the file is considered a [breaking change][] and so we are calling it out
as such.

If your project has Swagger UI style customizations, follow the steps outlined
in the previous section's [Action required](#scss-actions).

[breaking change]: /project/about/changelog/#breaking-change
[Swagger UI]: /docs/content/shortcodes/#swaggerui

## {{% _param BREAKING %}} blocks/cover shortcode changes {#blocks-cover}

Two changes to [blocks/cover], the first of which is a breaking change:

1. The shortcode now uses `.Inner` content directly, relying on Hugo's native
   Markdown content processing instead of file extension testing ([#939],
   [#2480]).

2. New `td-below-navbar` helper class lets you position the cover _below_ the
   fixed navbar on desktop, instead of behind it.

### Actions: required and optional {#blocks-cover-actions}

- {{% _param BREAKING %}} **Applies if** you use `blocks/cover` in `.html`
  content files with Markdown in the body.

  Use Hugo's shortcode [Markdown call syntax][]: `{{%/* */%}}`. Otherwise,
  Markdown content might not render correctly.

- {{% _param NEW %}} **Applies if** you want to position your `blocks/cover`
  below the navbar rather than behind it. Add the `td-below-navbar` helper class
  to your `blocks/cover` call. For example: `height="auto td-below-navbar"`. See
  [Below-navbar height adjustment][].

[below-navbar height adjustment]: /docs/content/shortcodes/#td-below-navbar
[blocks/cover]: /docs/content/shortcodes/#blocks-cover
[Markdown call syntax]:
  https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#notation

## {{% _param BREAKING %}} Hugo requirement and breaking changes {#hugo}

Docsy 0.14.0 [officially supports][] **Hugo 0.155.0 or later**, up from 0.152.2
in [Docsy 0.13.0][Upgrade to Docsy 0.13.0]. Hugo 0.153+ introduce breaking
changes that may affect your site, as well as major new features such as the
**multidimensional content model** provided through [sites.matrix].

For all the details, see our companion post on [Hugo 0.152.0 to
0.155.1][hugo-0.152.0+]. For a comprehensive list of issues and considerations
when moving to Hugo 0.153+, see [Hugo 0.153+ breaking changes & issues
(#2431)][#2431].

## Other notable Docsy changes {#other-notable-changes}

### {{% _param FA globe "" %}} Internationalization

Summary of changes:

- Theme i18n converted from TOML to YAML; redundant `other` form entries removed
  in favor of default singular/plural syntax ([#2447]).
- New locale: Hebrew.
- Alert type labels added to multiple locales ([#2390]).

**Action** (optional): applies if your project has i18n files. You have an
opportunity to clean up and reduce [technical debt][]:

- Remove redundant entries from your files where Docsy's additions or updates
  already cover them.
- Simplify your i18n files by dropping redundant `other` form entries (whether
  you convert to YAML or not).

### Style improvements and fixes

Docsy 0.14.0 includes the following style improvements and fixes:

- Navbar color contrast fixes ([#2413], [#2477])
- `<details>` margin fixes
- TOC h1 entries made slightly bolder so they are more visually distinct

Experimental extra styles:

- Navbar link decoration for active and hover states
- Nested-list margin fix for the last child

For details, see [Extra styles][].

[Extra styles]: /docs/content/lookandfeel/#extra-styles

### Shortcodes

- New [experimental] `td/site-build-info/netlify` shortcode for Netlify build
  info. See an [example](/project/#site-build-information).

### Clarified public vs internal theme features

Docsy 0.14.0 adds [definitions](/project/about/changelog/#definitions) to
clarify Docsy's public customization surface, internal/private features, and
support limits, so expectations are clear about what’s supported and what
changes require action:

- [Public customization surface](/project/about/changelog/#public)
- [Private/internal features](/project/about/changelog/#private)
- [Experimental features][experimental]
- [Breaking change](/project/about/changelog/#breaking-change)
- [Official support limits](/project/about/changelog/#official-support)

## {{% _param FA rocket primary %}} Upgrade to 0.14.0 {#upgrade}

> [!NB] First [upgrade to Docsy 0.13.0][] if you haven't already.

### Upgrade steps

Some upgrade steps are the same for each Docsy release (for example, updating
your Docsy NPM package or Hugo module). Those steps are described in [Upgrade to
Docsy 0.12.0][]: follow them, using version **0.14.0** where the guide refers to
0.12.0. For this release, use:[^vers-note]

- **Docsy**: [0.13.0] → [0.14.0]
- **Hugo**: 0.152.2 → 0.155.0 or later, see [Hugo 0.152.0 to
  0.155.1][hugo-0.152.0+].
- **Node**: LTS 24 (unchanged)

[^vers-note]:
    These are the officially supported Node.js and Hugo versions associated with
    the named Docsy versions. Later versions may work, but are not officially
    supported.

### Sanity checks

After upgrading, review the following:

- [ ] **Build output**: ensure that your site builds without errors, warnings,
      and deprecation notices.
- [ ] **[Styles and customization](#styles-customization)**: ensure that your
      site's look and feel is as expected. See
      [UI/UX spot-checks](#ui-ux-spot-checks) below.
- [ ] **Aliases**: Verify default-language redirects and that page aliases
      resolve to the correct language version. See [Hugo 0.152.0 to
      0.155.1][hugo-0.152.0+] for alias-related changes in 0.153+.

Also review the 0.12.0 [Testing checklist][].

### Cross-checks

Ensure that you have addressed all [breaking changes](#breaking-changes). For
your convenience, we link to required and optional actions for each section.

#### Required actions (as applicable) {#required-actions}

- [ ] [Navbar required actions](#navbar-actions)
- [ ] [`blocks/cover` required actions](#blocks-cover-actions)
- [ ] [Internal SCSS required actions](#scss-actions), including
      [Swagger UI](#swagger-scss)
- [ ] [Heading aliases and in-page targets required actions](#heading-aliases-actions)

#### Cleanup and site improvements (optional) {#cleanup-opportunities}

If your project overrides Docsy styles (navbar, blocks, TOC, and more), review
those overrides against the changes in this release. This often lets you remove
custom CSS/SCSS and reduce [technical debt][].

- [ ] Switch to [Markdown alert syntax](#alerts-actions)
- [ ] Adjust [navbar height and styling](#navbar-actions)
- [ ] Adjust [`blocks/cover` position](#blocks-cover-actions) relative to the
      navbar
- [ ] Remove redundant [i18n entries](#internationalization)

#### UI/UX spot-checks (optional) {#ui-ux-spot-checks}

These quick checks relate to the style and behavior changes in 0.14.0.

- [ ] Navbar theme, height, and cover translucency match your expectations.
- [ ] Fragment links and in-page targets land below the fixed navbar (see
      [Heading aliases and in-page targets](#heading-aliases)).
- [ ] `<details>` spacing in content pages.
- [ ] TOC h1 weight/contrast in the right sidebar.
- [ ] If you enable experimental extra styles, check nav link decoration and
      nested list spacing.

#### Advanced review {#advanced-overrides}

**Applies if** your project overrides Docsy templates or shortcodes.

Review these updated files and port changes as needed:

- [ ] [layouts/\_partials/navbar.html](#navbar-actions)
- [ ] [layouts/\_shortcodes/blocks/lead.html][blocks/lead.html]
- [ ] [layouts/\_shortcodes/blocks/section.html][blocks/section.html]
- [ ] [layouts/community/list.html][community/list.html]
