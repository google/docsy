## {{% _param NEW %}} Markdown alert syntax {#alerts}

Docsy 0.14.0 adds support for Hugo's Markdown alert syntax that looks like this:

```markdown
> [!NOTE] :star: Markdown alert syntax
>
> This syntax is more author, tooling, and AI friendly.
```

Which renders as:

> [!NOTE] :star: Markdown alert syntax
>
> This syntax is more author, tooling, and AI friendly.

We still support the [alert shortcode][], but recommend the Markdown alert
syntax for new content. For the new alert syntax and customization, see
[Alerts][].

### Action (optional) {#action-alert-shortcode}

If your project uses the `alert` shortcode, consider migrating to Markdown
alerts for consistency and better authoring/tooling support:

- Use Markdown alert syntax for new content.
- Where the output is equivalent, replace existing `alert` shortcodes with the
  Markdown syntax.
- Keep `alert` shortcodes when you rely on shortcode-specific behavior.

[alert shortcode]: /docs/content/shortcodes/#alert
[Alerts]: /docs/content/adding-content/#alerts

## {{% _param BREAKING %}} Styles and customization {#styles-customization}

This section covers breaking changes (marked :warning:) and new features for the
navbar, [internal] SCSS file reorganization and its impact on Swagger UI
customization.

[internal]: /project/about/changelog/#private

### {{% _param NEW %}} Navbar style improvements {#navbar}

**Highlights:**

- **Light or dark** navbar theme is now configurable _site-wide_ or _per page_,
  defaulting to your site's theme otherwise.
- Navbar **height** is now adjustable via a single SCSS variable!
- **New variables and classes** make it easier to customize the navbar look.
- **Navbar over cover images** now has improved styles and translucency
  behavior.
- **No more accidental SCSS file overrides!** Internal SCSS files now live under
  the private `td/` subdirectory.

Before 0.14.0, the navbar always used a dark theme and primary-colored
background. The navbar's [light/dark color theme][] is now configurable
**site-wide** and **per page**, defaulting to your site's theme. The default
navbar style matches your base site's style for a consistent look and
feel.[^navbar-bg-color]

Navbar **height and styling** are tunable via:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
- `$td-navbar-min-height` SCSS variable
- <details><summary>CSS variables (EXPERIMENTAL)</summary>

  - `--td-navbar-bg-color`
  - `--td-navbar-backdrop-filter`
  - `--td-navbar-border-bottom`
  - `--bs-bg-opacity`, used with `--td-navbar-bg-color` for background opacity
  - `--bs-link-underline-opacity`, nav link underline

  </details>

Learn more about the default [Navbar] appearance and [Customizing the navbar][].

[^navbar-bg-color]:
    Before 0.14.0, the navbar background was set to the primary color.

#### Action required {#navbar-action-required}

You may need to update your project in the following areas:

- {{% _param BREAKING %}} Navbar **light/dark color theme:** To restore the
  previous (always dark) behavior, set `params.ui.navbar_theme` to `dark`
  ([details][navbar-lightdark-theme]).

- **Height and variables:** If you customize navbar height or styling, review
  and simplify your customizations by using the new variables and styles -- see
  [Customizing the navbar][].

- **Navbar over cover:** If your project targets navbar cover translucency
  classes, review and simplify your styles ([navbar cover-image
  translucency][]):
  - `.td-navbar-transparent` (with `.td-navbar-cover`) replaces
    `.navbar-bg-on-scroll`
  - `.navbar-bg-onscroll--fade` removed

- If your project overrides the navbar partial, review [_nav.html][] for renamed
  classes and variables.

  <details>
  <summary class="h6 text-primary"><span class="fas fa-file-alt"></span> Summary of edits to <code>layouts/_partials/navbar.html</code></summary>

  <table class="table-bordered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="text-center">Before</th>
        <th class="text-center border-start">After</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr><th class="text-center" colspan="2" scope="colgroup">Cover translucency</th></tr>
    <tr><td>
  - `<nav>` had `td-navbar-cover` only
  - Projects used `.navbar-bg-on-scroll`, `.navbar-bg-onscroll--fade`

    </td><td class="border-start">
  - `<nav>` gets `td-navbar-cover` and `td-navbar-transparent`
  - Old classes removed

    </td></tr>
    <tr><th class="text-center" colspan="2" scope="colgroup">Light/dark theme</th></tr>
    <tr><td>
  - `data-bs-theme="dark"` always set on `<nav>`

    </td><td class="border-start">
  - `data-bs-theme="dark"` only when `params.ui.navbar_theme` is `"dark"`
  - Otherwise follows site theme

    </td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  For details, see the previous bullets of this Action required section.

### Heading aliases and in-page targets {#heading-aliases}

Heading aliases are a useful convention for keeping old [fragment] links
working. In 0.14.0, scrolling behavior is fixed (purely in CSS using
`scroll-padding-top`), so heading alias targets and in-page targets now scroll
to the right place. See [Heading aliases and in-page targets][heading-aliases+].

#### Action required {#action-required-heading-aliases}

To ensure proper scrolling behavior for your project's heading aliases and
in-page targets, do the following:

- Update heading aliases and in-page targets to be of the form
  [`<a id="..."></a>`][heading-aliases+], if not already.
- In particular, replace non-anchor targets such as `<span>` elements with
  `<a id="..."></a>` for more reliable scrolling.
- Replace legacy targets like `<a name="...">` with `id`-based targets.

[heading-aliases+]: /docs/content/navigation/#heading-aliases

### Improved separation of project and internal SCSS files {#improved-scss-soc}

Docsy 0.14.0 moves all its [internal] SCSS files from `assets/scss/` into the
`assets/scss/td/` subdirectory. This change clearly distinguishes [project style
files][] from internal theme files and helps projects avoid accidental overrides
of Docsy's internal SCSS files. For details on how to customize Docsy's look and
feel for your project, see [Project styles][] that covers:

- The [project style files][] that are supported for project-specific SCSS
  customization
- [Advanced style customization][] for projects that occasionally need to
  deviate substantially from Docsy's base styles

#### Action required {#action-required-post-scss-file-move}

If your project has any of the files in `assets/scss/` listed next, then you're
overriding Docsy's internal SCSS files.

<details>
<summary>
<span class="text-primary h6">
<span class="fas fa-file-alt"></span>
List of internal
<code>assets/scss/</code> files moved into the <code>td/</code> subdirectory

```

</details>

To continue using your customizations from, for example,
`assets/scss/_table.scss`, add the following import to your
`_styles_project.scss` file:

```scss
@import 'table';
```

Alternatively, you can copy the styles directly into `_styles_project.scss`.

#### {{% _param BREAKING %}} Swagger UI style customization {#swagger-scss}

Before 0.14.0, the User Guide incorrectly recommended overriding `_swagger.scss`
to customize [Swagger UI][] styles. [Internal] SCSS files are not meant to be
overridden; the guide has been corrected. Because the override was documented,
moving the file is considered a [breaking change][] and so we are calling it out
as such.

If your project has Swagger UI style customizations, follow the steps outlined
in the previous section's
[Action required](#action-required-post-scss-file-move).

[breaking change]: /project/about/changelog/#breaking-change
[Swagger UI]: /docs/content/shortcodes/#swaggerui

## {{% _param BREAKING %}} blocks/cover shortcode changes {#blocks-cover}

Using [blocks/cover] with markdown content? Call it with the Hugo's shortcode
[Markdown call syntax][]: `{{%/* */%}}`.

[blocks/cover]: /docs/content/shortcodes/#blocks-cover
[Markdown call syntax]:
  https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#notation

<details>
<summary class="h6 text-primary">Implementation details</summary>

Before 0.14.0, the `blocks/cover` shortcode would check if the page file had a
`.md` extension and apply `markdownify` to the shortcode's inner content.

The shortcode now uses `.Inner` content directly, relying on Hugo's native
Markdown content processing based on the shortcode delimiter used.

This change is the final cleanup step removing pre-Hugo-0.54.x behavior ([#939],
[#2480]).

</details>

## {{% _param BREAKING %}} Hugo requirement and breaking changes {#hugo}

Docsy 0.14.0 [officially supports][] **Hugo 0.155.0 or later**, up from 0.152.2
in [Docsy 0.13.0][Upgrade to Docsy 0.13.0]. Hugo 0.153+ introduce breaking
changes that may affect your site, as well as major new features such as the
**multidimensional content model** provided through [sites.matrix].

For all the details, see our companion post on [Hugo 0.152.0 to
0.155.1][hugo-0.152.0+]. For a comprehensive list of issues and considerations
when moving to Hugo 0.153+, see [Hugo 0.153+ breaking changes & issues
(#2431)][#2431].

## Other notable Docsy changes {#other-notable-changes}

### {{% _param FA globe "" %}} Internationalization

Summary of changes:

- Theme i18n converted from TOML to YAML; redundant `other` form entries removed
  in favor of default singular/plural syntax ([#2447]).
- New locale: Hebrew.
- Alert type labels added to multiple locales ([#2390]).

**Action** (optional): If your project has i18n files, you have an opportunity
to clean up and reduce [technical debt][]:

- Remove redundant entries from your files where Docsy's additions or updates
  already cover them.
- Simplify your i18n files by dropping redundant `other` form entries (whether
  you convert to YAML or not).

### Style improvements and fixes

Docsy 0.14.0 includes the following style improvements and fixes:

- `<details>` margin fixes
- TOC h1 entries made slightly bolder so they are more visually distinct

Experimental extra styles:

- Navbar link decoration for active and hover states
- Nested-list margin fix for the last child

For details, see [Extra styles][].

[Extra styles]: /docs/content/lookandfeel/#extra-styles

### Shortcodes

- New [experimental] `td/site-build-info/netlify` shortcode for Netlify build
  info. See an [example](/project/#site-build-information).

### Clarified public vs internal theme features

We added [definitions](/project/about/changelog/#definitions) to clarify Docsy's
public customization surface, internal/private features, and support limits, so
expectations are clear about what’s supported and what changes require action:

- [Public customization surface](/project/about/changelog/#public)
- [Private/internal features](/project/about/changelog/#private)
- [Experimental features][experimental]
- [Breaking change](/project/about/changelog/#breaking-change)
- [Official support limits](/project/about/changelog/#official-support)

## {{% _param FA rocket primary %}} Upgrade to 0.14.0 {#upgrade}

> [!NB] First [upgrade to Docsy 0.13.0][] if you haven't already.

### Upgrade steps

Some upgrade steps are the same for each Docsy release (for example, updating
your Docsy NPM package or Hugo module). Those steps are described in [Upgrade to
Docsy 0.12.0][]: follow them, using version **0.14.0** where the guide refers to
0.12.0. For this release, use:[^vers-note]

- **Docsy**: [0.13.0] → [0.14.0]
- **Hugo**: 0.152.2 → 0.155.0 or later, see [Hugo 0.152.0 to
  0.155.1][hugo-0.152.0+].
- **Node**: LTS 24 (unchanged)

[^vers-note]:
    These are the officially supported Node.js and Hugo versions associated with
    the named Docsy versions. Later versions may work, but are not officially
    supported.

### Sanity checks

After upgrading, review the following:

- **Build output**: ensure that your site builds without errors, warnings, and
  deprecation notices.
- **[Styles and customization](#styles-customization)**: ensure that your site's
  look and feel is as expected. See [UI/UX spot-checks](#ui-ux-spot-checks)
  below.
- **Aliases**: Verify default-language redirects and that page aliases resolve
  to the correct language version. See [Hugo 0.152.0 to 0.155.1][hugo-0.152.0+]
  for alias-related changes in 0.153+.

Also review the 0.12.0 [Testing checklist][].

### Cross-checks

Ensure that you have addressed all [breaking changes](#breaking-changes). For
your convenience, here is a summary of the previously mentioned required and
optional actions:

#### Required actions (as applicable) {#required-actions}

- Navbar: [Action required](#navbar-action-required).
- `blocks/cover`: use the [Markdown call syntax](#blocks-cover) if you use
  Markdown content.
- Internal SCSS: [Action required](#action-required-post-scss-file-move),
  including [Swagger UI](#swagger-scss).
- Heading aliases and in-page targets:
  [Action required](#action-required-heading-aliases).

#### Cleanup opportunities (optional) {#cleanup-opportunities}

If your project overrides Docsy styles (navbar, blocks, TOC, and more), review
those overrides against the changes in this release. This often lets you remove
custom CSS/SCSS and reduce [technical debt][].

Other cleanup opportunities not already covered in this section include:

- If your project has i18n files, review the Action section of
  [Internationalization](#internationalization).
- If your project uses the `alert` shortcode, consider switch to
  [Markdown alert syntax](#action-alert-shortcode).

#### UI/UX spot-checks (optional) {#ui-ux-spot-checks}

These quick checks relate to the style and behavior changes in 0.14.0.

- Navbar theme, height, and cover translucency match your expectations.
- Fragment links and in-page targets land below the fixed navbar (see
  [Heading aliases and in-page targets](#heading-aliases)).
- `<details>` spacing in content pages.
- TOC h1 weight/contrast in the right sidebar.
- If you enable experimental extra styles, check nav link decoration and nested
  list spacing.
