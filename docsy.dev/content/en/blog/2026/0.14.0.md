## {{% _param FA book "" %}} Documentation enhancements {#documentation-enhancements}

### {{% _param NEW %}} Hugo Markdown-style alert support

Docsy 0.14.0 adds support and documentation for Hugo's native Markdown-style
alert syntax. This provides an alternative to the traditional shortcode-based
alerts, offering a more Markdown-native approach to creating alerts in your
content.

### Documentation reorganization

The site documentation section has been renamed to "project" section, with pages
moved to the About section for better organization. This improves the structure
and discoverability of project-related documentation.

### Additional documentation improvements

- Added **AGENTS.md** guide for AI agents working with the Docsy codebase
- Added site build info and build documentation
- Added version badge to documentation pages
- Version tracking added to docs landing page

## {{% _param BREAKING %}} Hugo upgrade {#hugo-upgrade}

Docsy 0.14.0 requires **Hugo 0.154.5**, upgraded from 0.152.2 in Docsy 0.13.0.
This upgrade includes several breaking changes introduced in Hugo 0.153+ that
may affect your site.

### Breaking changes in Hugo 0.153+

Hugo 0.153+ introduces several breaking changes that you should be aware of:

- **macOS installations**: Hugo installation on macOS needs to be handled
  differently as of 0.153.0. See
  [issue #2429](https://github.com/google/docsy/issues/2429) for details.
- **Default language alias**: Changes to default language alias behavior may
  cause refresh page issues. See
  [gohugoio/hugo#14361](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/14361) for
  details.
- **Page aliases**: Page aliases may refer to the wrong language in some
  configurations. See [issue #2433](https://github.com/google/docsy/issues/2433)
  for details.

### New Hugo features

Hugo 0.154.4+ introduces new features that may be useful:

- **Canonical method**: New `canonical` method available on page output formats.
  See
  [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/methods/page/outputformats/#canonical).
- **disableDefaultLanguageRedirect**: Configuration option available since Hugo
  0.140.0. See
  [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/configuration/languages/#disabledefaultlanguageredirect).

### Resources for Hugo upgrade

For a comprehensive list of issues and considerations when upgrading to Hugo
0.153+, see [Hugo 0.153+ upgrade & issues (#2431)][#2431]. This issue tracks the
various problems we've encountered (and that other projects might face) during
the upgrade process.

**Before upgrading**, we strongly recommend:

1. Review Hugo's release notes for versions 0.153.0 through 0.154.5
2. Test your site with Hugo 0.154.5 in a development environment
3. Check for any custom Hugo configurations that might be affected
4. Review the [Hugo 0.153+ upgrade tracking issue][#2431] for known issues and
   workarounds

[#2431]: https://github.com/google/docsy/issues/2431

## Other notable changes

- **CI/CD improvements**: Netlify configuration moved to docsy.dev subrepo, CI
  cleanup and reorganization
- **Package updates**: Various npm packages updated alongside the Hugo upgrade

### Prerequisites

> {{% _param FA triangle-exclamation warning %}} **We recommend** that you
> [Upgrade to Docsy 0.13.0][] first because it contains significant breaking
> changes.

### Upgrade procedure

To upgrade from [0.13.0] to [0.14.0], follow the same steps as described in
[Upgrade to Docsy 0.13.0 from 0.12.0][upgrade-0.13], but use version 0.14.0
instead:

- **Docsy**: [0.13.0] → [0.14.0]
- **Hugo**: 0.152.2 → 0.154.5&nbsp;[^vers-note]
- **Node**: LTS 24 (unchanged)

[^vers-note]:
    These are the officially supported Node.js and Hugo versions associated with
    the named Docsy versions. Later versions may work, but are not officially
    supported.

After upgrading, review the [breaking changes](#breaking-changes) and test your
site thoroughly. Pay special attention to:

- **Language aliases**: Verify that default language redirects work correctly
- **Page aliases**: Check that aliases point to the correct language versions
- **macOS installations**: If you're on macOS, ensure Hugo is installed
  correctly
- **Build output**: Verify that your site builds without errors or warnings

For a testing checklist, see the [Upgrade to Docsy 0.13.0][upgrade-0.13] guide.
