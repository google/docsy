  Turn Docsy's optional scripts on or off, and configure them, from site
  configuration.
---

Docsy loads some of its optional JavaScript features as **plugins**: entries
under `params.docsy.plugins` in your site configuration.

## Configure Docsy's plugins

| Plugin            | What it does (Default / Loads on)                                                                  | Learn more                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `click-to-copy`   | Adds a copy button to code blocks (On, but off under Prism, which has its own / Every page)        | [Copy to clipboard][]          |
| `tabpane-persist` | Remembers the selected tab across pages (On / Every page ([why](#page-flags-in-included-content))) | [`tabpane`][]                  |
| `markmap`         | Renders `markmap` code blocks as mind maps (Off / Pages with a `markmap` code block)               | [Activating MarkMap support][] |
| `mermaid`         | Renders `mermaid` code blocks as diagrams (On / Pages with a `mermaid` code block)                 | [Diagrams with Mermaid][]      |

To turn a plugin off, set its `enable` field to `false`:

<!-- markdownlint-disable no-shortcut-ref-link -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{{< tabpane >}}
{{< tab header="Configuration file:" disabled=true />}}
{{< tab header="hugo.toml" lang="toml" >}}
[params.docsy.plugins.click-to-copy]
enable = false
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="hugo.yaml" lang="yaml" >}}
params:
  docsy:
    plugins:
      click-to-copy:
        enable: false
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="hugo.json" lang="json" >}}
{
  "params": {
    "docsy": {
      "plugins": { "click-to-copy": { "enable": false } }
    }
  }
}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable no-shortcut-ref-link -->

## Configuration reference

Docsy's own plugins are declared in the theme's [`hugo.yaml`][theme-defaults];
your entries merge over them by name and field ([Configuration § Theme
defaults][config-merge]). The schema defines each entry's keys, required fields,
types, defaults, and syntactic patterns:

{{< readfile file="/data/docsy/schema/params/docsy.yaml" code="true" lang="yaml" >}}

- Fields are optional unless marked `required: true`.
- `{}` for a theme plugin keeps every inherited field, including `enable`.
- Language-specific `params` apply, so an entry can differ per language.
- `enable` is off for `false`, `"false"`, and `0`, and on for any other value.
  The string forms exist for [environment overrides][config-env].
- `version` selects the version of a plugin's dependency, not of the plugin
  script or of Docsy. To override a theme plugin's pin, see [Mermaid
  version][mermaid-version] or [MarkMap version][markmap-version].
- `options` holds a plugin's own settings, as a string whose format and
  validation are the plugin's; Docsy passes the value to the plugin unchanged.
  For the shape a theme plugin takes, see its guide ([Mermaid
  settings][mermaid-settings]).
- `_defer` is the plugin author's field (the `_` prefix marks such fields),
  declared with the plugin
  ([Loading strategy (experimental)](#loading-strategy)); leave it alone on a
  plugin you didn't write.

### Warnings

Every registry shape warning carries the id `docsy-config` (to silence one, see
[Configuration § Configuration warnings][config-warnings]):

- An unknown field is ignored and the rest of the entry applies.
- An unknown key directly under `params.docsy` is ignored and the rest of the
  map applies.
- A name the schema's pattern rejects or that ends in its reserved suffix, a
  scalar entry, or an entry missing a required field drops the whole entry.
- A `params.docsy` or `params.docsy.plugins` that is not a map empties the
  registry, Docsy's own plugins and their deprecated aliases included.
  `plugins: {}` keeps them; a valueless `plugins:` is null and drops them.
- An empty registry after configuration merging warns; a registry with all
  entries disabled is valid.
- An enabled name with no script file
  ([Plugin files (experimental)](#plugin-files)) is a different fault: it warns
  `docsy-plugin-missing` (a disabled entry is never looked up).

`version` validation applies to entries not already dropped by the shape guards,
including disabled entries. An exact `X.Y.Z` passes without a version warning;
another value matching the schema's pattern, such as `latest`, warns under
_`NAME`_`-floating-version`, where _`NAME`_ is the entry's name. An empty or
malformed value fails the build and skips the entry before its companion runs.

For why Docsy pins versions, see [Pinned script-dependency versions][ug-pins].

## Add a custom script

{{%_param BADGE EXPERIMENTAL info %}}

This section is [experimental][];
[configuring Docsy's plugins](#configure-docsys-plugins) is supported.

For a script that should load at the end of every page, register it as a plugin;
for markup in `<head>`, inline snippets, or third-party tags, use the [head and
body hooks][] instead.

1. Save the script as `assets/js/plugins/`_`NAME`_`.js`, with _`NAME`_ in
   lowercase.
2. Register it under `params.docsy.plugins`
   ([configuration reference](#configuration-reference)):

<!-- markdownlint-disable no-shortcut-ref-link -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{{< tabpane >}}
{{< tab header="Configuration file:" disabled=true />}}
{{< tab header="hugo.toml" lang="toml" >}}
[params.docsy.plugins.NAME]
enable = true
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="hugo.yaml" lang="yaml" >}}
params:
  docsy:
    plugins:
      NAME:
        enable: true
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="hugo.json" lang="json" >}}
{
  "params": {
    "docsy": {
      "plugins": { "NAME": { "enable": true } }
    }
  }
}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable no-shortcut-ref-link -->

### Plugin files

A project file shadows the theme's of the same name, which is how you replace
one of Docsy's plugins, its companions, or its shim.

| File                                                           | Contract                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `assets/js/plugins/`_`NAME`_`.js`                              | Required. Built on its own with [`js.Build`][].                                                                            |
| `layouts/_partials/scripts/plugins/`_`NAME`_`.html`            | Optional companion partial for vendored libraries, markup, or configuration; receives `(dict "Page" PAGE "Plugin" ENTRY)`. |
| `assets/scss/plugins/`_`NAME`_`.scss`                          | Optional companion stylesheet, through the Sass pipeline.                                                                  |
| `layouts/_partials/scripts/plugins/`_`NAME`_`_docsy-shim.html` | Optional shim partial; [adjust a plugin per page](#adjust-a-plugin-per-page).                                              |

Companions emit before the script ([why][design-ordering]). Script and
stylesheet tags carry [subresource integrity][SRI] in every environment. Entry
keys reach templates lowercase ([Configuration § Key spelling][config-keys]).

### Loading strategy

A plugin's script runs synchronously by default. For a script that scans the
document once when it runs, set `_defer: true`. The script then runs after
parsing and sees markup emitted after its tag, including the [body-end
hook][head and body hooks], as `click-to-copy` does. Declare `_defer` where you
register the plugin, or set it in its [shim](#adjust-a-plugin-per-page).

### Adjust a plugin per page

A **shim** adjusts a plugin's registry entry for each page before the plugin
loads. Add one for your own plugin, or for one of Docsy's. Three of Docsy's
plugins ship a shim, `mermaid`, `markmap`, and `click-to-copy`: your file
replaces that plugin's shim and everything it does ([shim contract][impl-shim]),
so start from a copy of the theme's file, in [`scripts/plugins/`][theme-shims].

Create `layouts/_partials/scripts/plugins/`_`NAME`_`_docsy-shim.html`, with the
plugin's registry name as _`NAME`_ ([shim contract][impl-shim]):

```go-html-template
{{ $entry := .Plugin -}}
{{ if not (.Page.Store.Get "hasMyFeature") -}}
  {{ $entry = merge $entry (dict "enable" false) -}}
{{ end -}}
{{ return $entry -}}
```

That shim loads the plugin only on pages that use it: a render hook of yours
sets the flag with `.Page.Store.Set` where the feature's markup appears. Before
relying on a flag, read
[Page flags in included content](#page-flags-in-included-content).

### Dependency versions

For a custom plugin with a configurable dependency, set `version` on its
registry entry ([configuration reference](#configuration-reference)) and read
`.Plugin.version` in the companion partial. Use that value to select the
dependency's code, for example in a build-time fetch URL. Declaring `version`
does not fetch code automatically. Omit the field if the plugin has no
dependency version to configure.

The entry's `version` is not passed to the plugin script. For a working example,
see the `markmap` companion in [`scripts/plugins/`][theme-shims].

### Plugin settings

A plugin reads its settings from its entry's `options`
([configuration reference](#configuration-reference)); the shim receives the
value as the site wrote it and may decode it before the companion runs. Choose
the string's format and document it with the plugin. It is a string because Hugo
lowercases map keys ([why][design-registry]); Docsy's plugins take a **JSON
object**, decoded at build time with `transform.Unmarshal`, or in the browser
with `JSON.parse` after the companion emits it. For the pattern, see the
`mermaid` shim and companion in [`scripts/plugins/`][theme-shims] ([shim
contract][impl-shim]).

### Security

- Pin third-party dependencies on the entry's `version`, never `latest`.
- Vendor build-time fetches and serve them with SRI.
- Use no loader that pulls unpinned secondary code, which SRI on the loader
  can't cover.
- Load remote code only on pages that use it:
  [gate the plugin with a shim](#adjust-a-plugin-per-page).

## Page flags in included content

Some plugins load only on pages that need them: Docsy's `markmap` render hook
sets a page flag whenever a page has a `markmap` code block, and the plugin
ships where the flag is set. A flag counts only when it lands on the page whose
output the plugin is emitted into.

- A **render hook** runs in the context of the page being rendered, so a
  `markmap` block in content pulled in through [`.RenderShortcodes`][] flags the
  page that includes it.
- A **shortcode** runs in the context of the page whose file contains it, so a
  shortcode in included content would flag the _included_ page, and the
  including page would never see the flag.
- Content pulled in through `.Content` flags the included page in both cases.

That is why Docsy ships `tabpane-persist` ungated, on every page: tabpanes come
from a shortcode. For MarkMap's authoring paths and the remedy, see [When a
MarkMap doesn't render][].
